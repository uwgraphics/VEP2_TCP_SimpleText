To the most puissaunt prince, and our most redoubted sovereign Lord Edward
the sixthe, by the Grace of God King of England, France, and Irelande,
defendour of the faith, and on earth next and immediately under God, of the
Churches of England and Irelande the supreme head, your most humble, loving,
and obedient subject, Nicolas Udal wishes al grace and peace from God, with
long and the same most prosperous Reign over us, in all honor, health, and
condign felicity. Most noble and most worthy Sovereign,
it might in me so basse and simple a person, appear no small presumpcion to
write unto your Imperial Majesty, were not the cause of our public
gratulacions so just and so great, that no man, what ever he be, having
occasion to write, may think himself void of crime; if he should omytte to
declare and testify the inestimable comfort and joy, which your universal
most loving and obedient subjects, daily more and more do take of your
Majesty's singular good procedinges and most excellent towardness. For where,
by ye space of many years until it pleased the goodness of God to send you
unto us, the earneste prayers of all England was that we might have a Prince:
and after the time of your nativity, when God had so gracyously heard our
peticions, we eftsons prayed that ye might have grace to follow the godly
steps and proceadynges of your most noble father: every man sees now in
your Maiestee such towardenes of virtue and godly zele, that we have conceived
no less then an undoubted hope yt ye will (by Gods governance) far pass
your said father, to whom our daily wysshinges and prayers thought it enough
to have you eguall. We all see in your highness such lively sparks of virtue
and Christian regiment toward, that we cannot but think England the most
fortunate Royalme that ever was, to whom God has given such a King, as in
his minoritye of tender babehood, learneth to have mind on his funccion, and
to considre whose mynistre he is. If Royalmes (after the saying of Plato) are
than and never else in blissed state, when either Philosophiers, that is to
say, such as know and love God, do reign over the same, or else the Kings
give themselves to philosophy, that is to say, to the due knowledge of God,
to the disciplyne of virtue, and to the vpryght execucion of their office
toward all people: how happy are we Englishmen of such a King, in whose
chyldehood appears as perfeict grace, virtue, godly zele, desire of
literature, gravity, prudence, justice, and magnaniraitie, as has heretofore
been found in Kings of most mature age, of full discrecion, of ancient reign,
and of passing high estimacion? But such is the goodness, of God, that to a
people eagerly hongreyng and thrysting his justice, earnestly sekyng the ways
of his truth, tendrely enbracyng his most holy word, readily acceptyng the
grace of his ghospel, wyllyngly conformyng themselfes to the sincere doctrine
of his commandments, he forgeateth not to give a sapient King and governor.
And that God has of a singular favor and mercy toward this Royalme of
England sent your grace to reign over us, ye thing self by the whole
process does declare: the sum whereof I shall in a short discourse no more
but briefly touch and pass over, lest I might seem rather to have sought an
occasion in the way of flatery to extolle you and your progeny, then as this
present cause enforces me, to give due testimony of the truth. In deed your
singular excellency in all kinds of princely towardness is such, yt no
place, no time, no cause, no book, no person either in public audience or
else in private cou^paignie makes any mention of your Maistie, but he thinks
himself even of a very conscience bound to powdre the same with manyfold praises
of your incomparable virtues and gifts of grace. Al which praises and
magnifying though they be in deed much inferior to your most woorthye
deserts hitherto, yet your majesty must take and repute, not as a matter of
insolency by your most loving and faithful subjects ministered unto you, but
rather as a thing wrought in them by the instincte of god, to admonish you of
the Regal estate that he has called you unto: not as a prouocacio^ of wordelye
gloriyng in your self, but as an instrumente of admonicion to continue you in
remembrance of thanks giving, and of discharging your office: not as the
baits of flatery meaning to feed your Majesty in any conceipte of pride, but
rather as a glass wherein to behold your self what ye are, and how ye ought
to continue: not as the pleasant ticleing or clawyng of adulacion but rather
as a caucion that ye do nothing in all your life whereby ye may be found
or thought unworthy the laud that is given you: and finally, not as a
nourishmente of any humam vanity, but rather as a spur of exhortacion, not
only to beware that ye go not back, ne degenerate, or decline from the godly
trade of religion, of virtue, of litterature, of prudence of benig^itie, of
justice, of princely regiment that ye are now entered into: but also that ye
proceed as ye have begoonne, and still go forward encreasyng in all
godliness, that your procedynges and consummacion may be aunswerable to your
most princely and Christian begynnynges. Neither is there any subject of yours
worthy life. which would to any other end or purpose, attempt to magnifye
you in this tender age, but in hope, that if ye be not already come to the
perfeccion propouned unto you, ye will labor and contend (as age may
suffer,) to grow and reach unto it. For if Philip of Macedonie, being an
ethnike and a pagane King, when he was railed at and much evil spoken of by
the Atheniens, took thereof an occasion well to reign and govern his people,
alleagyng himself to be enforced and co^streigned theru^to, yt he might prove
his enemies untrue men of their reports: how much more necessity of well
doing is incumbent to your highness, that ye may in time coming, verify the
praises and co^mendacions, which the publyque consent of the world does
now attribute unto you? Howebeeit we your most feythfull loving subjects
do nothing doubt, but that God being the geuer of all good gifts, the
father of all mercy, and the God of all coumforte, who of his infinite
goodness has provided you to reign over us, will also in such wise direct
all your ways, that he will euydentely declare himself by his eternal
wisdom, and by his counsayll inscrutable, to have purposely ordained and
appointed you to do high things, whom he has by his myghtifull arm so
woondrefully sent. For where your most noble father of famous memory King
Henry the eight being otherwise by all tokens of natural constitucion, a man
hable and also likely to have children, had already by the two most fair
blossoms and most fresh flowers of the world, the lady Mary's Grace, and the
lady Elizabethes Grace, your Majesty's most noble and most dear sistur^ yet
living, declared himself apt to be very fruicteful of procreacion: yet had
he continued eight and twenty years King of this Royalme, ere he had any
soonne in lawful matrimony begotten, to whom he might leave the succession
of this his Imperial croune and scepter. In the mean time King Henry as a
most vigilaunt pastor cease not with perpetual trauayll to procure for the
commodities and wealth of England, he cease not by most politic and most
wholesome laws to provide for the establishyng of England in peace and
tranquillity. And because by the diligent readyng and meditacion if holy
Scriptures, he found and observed the true blissynges of God, and the
fountain of al grace and prosperity to proceed of the knowleage of God, and
the due obseruacion of his laws, like a most christian Prince and a true
defendour of the faith, he converted and employed al his study and cogitacions
to the redress of such abuses in relygion, as by the most corupte doctrine of
the Romish papacye had by degrees crepte into Christ's church, and preuailyng
through continuance of years, were now so confirmed and established
throughout all parties of Christendom, that the Romish Nabugodonozor held us
in forer subieccion, then ever was Israel holden in the captivity of old
Babylon, and so should we have still continued, had it not pleased almighty God
of his botomlesse mercy, to reise up a Christian Cyrus your most puissaunt
father, to restore us again to our freedom in Christ's blood. For the Romish
Nabugodonozor had by wrestyng and peruertyng the holy scriptures of God to the
establyshing and maintenance of his usurped supremitie clymed so high: that he
was not now content to sit in the chair of Moses, but had most
blasphemously exalted himself above all that is called God, that is to say,
had made Gods word frustrate, that his most corrupt and most pestilente
doctrine might take place. He had by his deiulishe inuencions cast such a
foggie miste of ignorance over Gods most holy Bible, he had with his
Pharisaicall interpretacions in such wise polluted the sincerity of Christ's
doctrine, he had so infeeted the clear fountain of Gods word with the
suddes of humayne tradicions, and the dregs of vayn ceremonies, he had by
mean of papisticall troumperie so perverted the understanding of holy
scriptures, he had so defaced the purity of the faith with the beggarly
patched cloak of supersticious weorkes not commanded by Gods law, he had so
perplexed the grace of the gospel with the false feigned merits and weorkes
of supererogacion, he had so mangled the Christian profession with mo then an
hundred soondry sects of counterfaicte cloystreers of Antichrists own
generation, living like idle loitreers and vera^dranes, and under the pretense
of religion deuouryng the commonweals that would maynteyn them, he had so
oppressed the true religion and wurshyppyng of God with pilgremages to dead
stocks and stones of man's handie weorke, with transferryng the honor
which was due to God alone, unto Saints and to feigned miracles, with other
kinds of idolatry innumerable, and with a purgatory of material fire, and
(to make some end of speaking in a matter of it self infinite,) he had so
clean subverted al good and godly conversation and doctrine: that Satan had no
more power of the world when Christ came down to earth for to redeem
mankind, then religion was now brought out of frame by the tyranny of the
Romyshe Babylon, nor God and his soonne Jesus Christ any where less found,
than when he was most buisily named and spoken of in pulpites. Being under
the title and name of Christ, the most eagre aduersarye of Christ and his
gospel, he joined himself to the Philistines, and being their Goliath more
nere sixtene then six cubits high, neither feared* ne shamed to show
himself in plain battayl of defiaunce, ne spared to open his blasphemous
mouth, ne to draw his tyrannous sweorde, ne to shake his huige murderyng
spear, against the true Israelites of Christ's little selie flock, and most
presumpteously to braggue against all that ever would profess the sincere and
vpryght doctrine of Gods word, till it pleased God to reyse up unto us an
English Dauyd your most noble father, who without any armoure or weapon of
iron and stele, without any harness of man's making, without displeighing any
banners in array of human battle, should out of the slyng of his Regal
authority, cast the corner stone of Gods word, which lyghtyng upon the
forhead of the said Goliath, felled his papacy stone dead, and crushed it to
poudre, never to be hable any more to noye or to face English Israel. Our said
David king Henry the eight had learned by the book of Deuteronomie (in which
book the feithfull servant of God Moses charged that whomsoever Israel
should make King over them, the same from the time that he were set in his
Regal throne, should all the days of his life have continual meditacion, and
should still read therein, to the entente he might learn to fear the Lord
his God, for to keep all the words of his law, and his ordinances for to
do them, and that he should not turn from the commandments either to the
right hand or to the left, that both he and his children might prolong their
days in his Kingdom:) he had (I say) learned in the same book, on the one
side the blessings of god promised to all such princes as on their own
parties would for the love and fear of god walk vpryghtly in the execucion
of the said commandments, and would partly by their good exaumple provoke
their subjects to do the same, and partly by due execucion of justice make
them ashamed and also afeard to swerue or declyne from the lord their god: and
on the other side the terrible malediccions and plagues of gods wrath,
threatened to all such as neglected the vpryght obseruyng of all his precepts
and ways. He loved the goodness of God, and feared his stroke, he saw
religion to be far out of frame, he saw some part of his most earnest
travails and endeavor to set England in most quiet and blissful state,
to fayl of condign effect through defaulte of reformacion in matters of
religion. He saw and found by experience of his own manyfolde most princely
enterpryses, the only cause why Christian Royalmes are plagued with wars,
derthes, famyns, pestilences, and other mortal extremyties, to come of Gods
indignacion, because the world was so far gone astraigh from Christ, that
nothing was now weaxed so odious or detestable as his holy word, nothing
reputed so blasphemous, as Christ's holy gospel, nothing so light esteemed as
Christ's blood and passion. He saw the only way to Gods favor to be the
enbracyng of his holy Scriptures, the drounyng whereof had enforced God to power
his indignacion upon the Christian world. He saw and well perceived that God
of his mercy was wylling to cease his wrath and vengeance, if the Christian
people would return to him. He perceived God to offer his grace unto the
world by openyng their iyes, if leauyng their error and ignorance they
would enbrace the clear light of the gospel. He saw moreover that his most
loving subjects of England, (whom his godly exaumple had provoked to tender
and seek the glory of God) did now houngre and thirste the righteousness of
God, and the knowleage of his word. He plainly saw that no way there was to
a reformacion, but by this only mean, if the authority and usurped supremitie
of the Sea of Rome were extirped, abolished, and clean extincte. For he saw his
countreimen the English Israelites to be holden in such extreme bondage
within the Romish Egypt, that there was no hope of deliverance, but by the
only power and myghtifull arm of God reysyng up some Moses that would in the
face of that same most cruel Pharao require that Israel might be freely
leat go. The huige seuenfold headed draguon was to the simple inferior
people, such an obstacle, that they might not come to Christ, and to all
Christen princes such a terror, that they durst not. This draguon besides
the monstreous hissing of his curses and excommunicacions, and besides the
contagious infeccion of idolatry and superstition, wherewith he had by his
whelps the cancarde papists so adblasted the world, that he had enwrapped
and drowned all Christendom in blindness and error: he had also a mortal
styng in his taill, wherewyth he ceased not by all kinds of deaths and
torments, to destruye and mourdre as many as would once open their lyppes
against his most detestable and most blasphemous abominacions. This draguon
ceased not continually to persecute the woman clothed in the sun, that is to
say, Christ's dear spouse the church of England, but as a rampyng and roryng
lion, he stood ever ready watchyng that he might devour her children the
Christian flock, which she now groned to bring forth to Christ, had not
the English Michael king Henry the eight taken in hand to fight against the
said draguon, and been strengthened of God with his Aungelles the lords, and
godly prelates, to cast the said draguon that old serpente and his Angels
out of England. This was the great harlotte that sits upon many waters,
with whom the kings of the yearthe have committed fornicacion, and the
inhabiters of the yearthe been made drounken with the wine of her fornicacion:
the woman sittyng upon the rosecouloured and tenhorned beast full of names of
blasphemye, she sitting araied in purple and rosecolour, and decked with gold,
precious stones, perles, and in her hand a cup of gold full of
abhominacions and filthiness of her fornicacion, and in her forehead a name of
great mystery written, great Babylon the mother of whoredom and abhominacions
of the earth: and the same whore drounken with the blood of Saynctes, and
with the blood of witnesses of Jesus. This was the huyge monstre Hydra, (to
whom the poets attribute seven heads, some eyghte, and some an hundred
heads) whom as well king John of England, as also soondrie other Cstristen
princes had attempted to vanquishe, but as soon as they had cut of one
head, three other heads grew up for it, so that every wound that was given
him was a more confirmacion and increase of his strength, until our Hercules
King Henrye the eyghte perceyuyng that no power, no puissaunce, no weapon was
hable to confound him saving only the consumyng fire of Gods word,
provided the Bible to be set forth in the English tongue, and to be set
up in every church, where it might be read of of his people. Long time
endured this conflycte between our English Hercules and the Romish Hydra ere
he could be destruied, so fast grew up a more number of serpentine heads,
when any one was cut of. For besides the manyfolde most monstrous heads, of
Idolatrye, Pylgremages, supersticions, countrefaicte religions, and innumerable
abuses mo, which king Henry had to cut of, his whelps the indurate
generation of papists devised all means possible to keep his authority still
in England, ne left any engine unattempted to staigh and let the abolishyng
of his usurped power, abusyng the simple people with all kinds of delusion and
iuggleyng of countrefaicte miracles, of feigned visions, of liyng in traunces,
of rapcions even unto the third heaven, of sophistycall learning, of holy
contestacions, of subtily invented prophecies, of bold comminacions and
threateninges, of voices avouched to have come from heaven, of peruertyng the
sense of scripture to maintain his power, of writing books in derogacyon of
the kings procedynges.

And to the end there should not lack any kind of wickedenesse that the
said Hydra and his adherentes, moonkes, friars., and other cloystreers were
hable to weorke, he found means besides many other storms of forrayne wars
and conspiracies, so far to abuse the credulity of the simple ignoraunte
people, that he brought them half in a detestacion and hatered of Gods
word, and seduced them to adventure with a little blaste of sedicion, to
distourbe the cogitacions of such a noble and a good king, being than most
ea^nestelye yea (I may say) only set in studiyng for the establishemente
and continuacion of peace and tranquillity in this Royalme for ever. All which
terrors could not appalle king Henryes most stout courage, but that he
went thorough with the reformacion, which the spirit of God so wrought in
his heart and conscience, that he saw it to be necessary, and himself to
be chosen of God, to be the instrumente thereof.

All this while England though not yet very wyllyngly ne universally
receyuyng the grace of the gospel offreed unto us, together with the most
heavenly jewel and treasure of Gods holy scripture, in the mother language:
ye^ nevertheless (as our parties and most bounden duties were) tenderlye
considering the most vigilaunte care and study, and most earneste travail
of our most gracious sovereign employed for our behoufe, and daily bestowed
in fortifiyng all parties of the Royalme against the malicious assaults and
conspiracies of the said Romish Hydra, or any other enemies by his
procuremente: England (I say) ceased not with continual prayer to beseech
the goodness of almyghtye God, to reward the godly mind and dooynge of our
king now wearyng out his body in trauayllyng for us, and spendyng his life
in procuryng for our wealth and safegarde, with a soonne, to whom, when he
should depart hence to heaven, he might safely commit and leave his croune,
with the governance of us his most dear beloved subjects: Thus did all
England by the space of many years persiste in continual prayer: but
almyghtie God wyllyng to show for what persons he reserueth his blyssynges,
as soon as we had through better instruccyons conformed our selves to the
expulsyng of the Romyshe Antichriste, to the glad enbracyng of his word,
and to the receyuyng of his gospel in all parties: immediately heard our
lamentable peticions, and sent your most noble mother Queen Jane of famous
memory, whom (as it may be thought) his prouydence and consailles
vnscrutable had purposely ordained, prepaired, and caused to be borne for none
other office, but that she might be most dear wife to such a king, and
mother to such a Prince. For as soon as she had in most lawful matrymonye
brought forth your grace, she departed this world: as though she should have
said: I have dooen the office yt I was borne for now fare ye well. The
freashe flower of my pure virginity, I have most safely committed to my most
dear spouse king Henry for to keep, and to you his most feithfull loving
subjects, I leave behind me my only soonne, the jewel that ye have so long
desired, so sore longed for, and so often craved of God. As long as ye shall
tender his welfare, ye shall satisfye my desire, whom I brought forth for
that purpose. If it may please God to send him long life, I have the full
fruicte of my trauaylle, I have my death abundauntely recomp^nsed, and my
room among you even to my mind supplied. I have now no more to do on
earth. If I have demerited any love or thank at your hands, bestow it
wholly on my soonne, when I am gone from you. Thus departed the most virtuous
lady Queen Jane, whose death we have the less cause to lamente, because that
by hope we are assured, that she is gone from pain to joy, from care to
rest, from sorrow to bliss, from this tra^sitorie world to immortality. We
have cause to suppose that God for the exceadyng great love and favor that he
bears toward England, when she had brought forth to the world such a
soonne, took her away immediately of purpose to reward her with a croune
eternal, for whom all temporal and worldely rewards were incomparably over
basse, ne any yearthly croune sufficient: so that to lamente her, is rather to
envy her felicity and bliss. And she being now in heaven with her most
desired joy Christ, inuiteth and requires us that our beneuolente love and
affeccion, which must have been divided between you and her, may be wholly
transferred and bestowed on your highness, whom to bring forth she was not
only well contented, but also much desirous to dye. So that we are all double
bound to love your Majesty, first because your most dear mother was taken
from us ere she might receive any fruicte of our grate and thankful hertes for
bryngyng forth to her country such a soonne, and than much more, because
that in your most Royal person is reposed all the worldly joy, coumforte,
hope, and expectacion both of us that are now living (whom I trust your
Grace shall surutue,) and also of our posterity. Neither can Iiustely affirm
her to be dead, that has leafte behind her such fruicte of her body, whom
to bring forth (I dare auouche) she though her death so well bestowed, that in
case she might return to life again, and be in her former state of maid and
Queen, she would readily paryshe and covenant with God, on the same price to
bring forth your Grace unto her country. And so great was the joy and
gladness of England in the nativity of your highness, that the very
providence of God thought it necessary to temper our immoderate mirth and
rejoicing with the death of your most virtuous mother (for never was ye
deceasse of any Queen in England more lamented) lest we might have been so
inebriate with our inestimable felicity, yt the same might have made us proud,
and percase have brought us in such flaterye of our selves, yt we would have
forgotten, or perchance not acknowelaged no nor espied you to be sent unto
us as well by the most mighty and most woondrefull power of Gods hand, as
also of his exceadyng mercy, and favor toward England. He might have
taken her away ere she had cum to the bearing or conceiving of you in her
womb, if he had not specially loved and tendered our good king Henry and us. It
was in his hand and pleasure to have taken you both (which thing god
forbydde) if he had not by leaving the better of the two with us, been willing
both many festelye to declare his almyghtifull power joined with his most
gracious mercy and tender compassion toward England, and also to bridle the
insolency, which by having you both still with us (such is man's frailte,
and readiness to swerue) he paraduenture foresawe, would have grown in us.
God in taking away her at your birthe did plainlye ministre unto us, both an
earnest warning, and also a just prouocacion of vncessaunt praying for the life
and prosperous continuance of your Grace being of nature and by the condition
of your birth, mortal as your mother was. The birth of your Majesty was the
more sweet, because it was so long wished for, so long looked for, and so long
craved ere it came. A great benefit is much the sweter that it is not
obtained without great and long suit. The pleasure of a good turn is much
diminished when it is at the first obtained. The desirefulnesse of our minds
much augmenteth and encreseth our pleasure. The admixtion also and (as who
should say) the sawcyng of pleasures with some kind of misfortune either
before going or in the mids adtempered, graceth altogether, and makes it the
more acceptable. Honey is waloweish and ouercasteth the stomach, if it be
plenteously taken by it self alone: but if with vinegre it be made
eagredoulce, than is it not only delectable and plesaunt of relice, but also
comfortatiue and wholesome too. The death of the most virtuous lady and most
worthy Queen Jane your mother, being joined with your birth, made such a
^^mperature of sorrow and joy together, that both our mournyng which
otherwise should scaree have found any end, was soon mitigated: and also
our most tender desire of enjoying your Majesty, much the more increased. We
had so long groned, we had so long cried to God for a Prince: that except he
had in the most desi^ed birthe of the same, aspersed the death of your
most ^ere Mother: we should by our immoderate felicitee have tempted, and
provoked him to take you both from us. It was his goodness^ that would not
suffer us to fall. For much sooner and sorer does immoderate joy drounde
man's reason, then immoderate doloure. Thus than (as I have said) as soon as
we willingly applied our selfs as well to ye exiling of al pap^strie, as also
to thenbracing of the word of God, he immediately fulfilled and satisfied
our^ desires by sending your Grace unto us after a woondreful sort: as if he
should in plain words have said: Now that ye have gladly received my word,
ye shall have that which ye cannot but of my gift obtain, that is to wete, a
Prince, and with him al worldely coumforte, joy and secu^itie that ye may well
perceive both yt nothing is impossible to God, and also that if ye abide in me,
and my words abide in you, ask what ye will, and it shall be dooen for you.
When I say, the word of God, ye law, the precepts, or ye commandments of
God, I mean not fantastical dreams of man's inuencio^ (for these things are
nothing less the^ ye word of God) but I mean the true and lively word of God
contained in holy scriptures: I mean his holy gospel and testament, purely and
sinc^rely taken without the venomous corrupcion of the fylthie dregs, or of
the sour leaven of any the above rehearsed pestilencies, according as your
most noble father our late sovereign lord king Henry the eight with
inestimable care, study, and trauayll, minded and labored to have it set
forth, and to be daily preached and taught to his people without any declynyng
either to the right hand or to the left. Which thing if he could not so
thoroughly accomplish as his most earneste hertes desire was, I trust ye
almyght^e god, who has provided and sent us your highness a most woorthye
soonne to succeed such a woorthye father, will by his especial grace illumine
your heart to proceed in the way of truth which your father has opened unto
you, and will give you grace al things to perfe^cte which your father most
godly began to your hands. And although to maynteine, uphold, and conserve
yt king Henry prepayred and has now left to your governance, is of it self
so much matter of immortal honor and renoume, yt it were enough for any king
to doo^: yet has God provided yt ye shall not have cause to ^aie as Alexander
the great conque^our, when he considered the great and manyfold acts of his
father Phylip king of Macedonie, said: My father will leave nothing for me to
do. For god of a veraie pietye that he had on king Henry's incomparable and
the same vncea^^au^t trauaylles for the public behouf and wealth of England
long years sustained, took him away from this troubleous world as soon as
he had prepaired your Grace in a readiness by due succession of inheritance
to receive at his hands ye scepter and croune of his royalmes and dominions.
God by a special dispe^sacio^ break of ye course of his life ere al things
were brought to a full perfeccio^, because he would declare himself to have
appointed your Majesty, not to live altogether in a careless supmitie, but in
a perpetual exercise of al princely virtues, yt ye might consu^mate and finishe
such regal enterpryses as he begoonne, partly in other worldly affairs, and
especially concerning ye redress of abuses in matters of religion. King Henry
was the Moses who^ God elected stoutly to deliver us out of the hands of ye
Romish Pharao, and to conueigh us through the read sea of the waueryng
judgments of me^, and the troubleous sourges of ye popish generacio^
swelling and rageyng against him, and through the wildrenesse of being left
alone destitute of ye assiste^ce or coumforte of other Christian princes, which
in this so noble and so godly an enterprise might laudably have set in foot
with him, and through this wildrenes to co^ducte us as far as ye land of Moab:
but ye are the Iosue, whom god has appointed to bring us into the land of
promissio^, flowyng and re^nyng with milk and honey, and to set us English
men in the land of Canaan which is the sincere knoweleage and the free
exercise of Gods most holy word. He was the Moses, who by gods
ordeinaunce and dispensacion wrote the book of Deuteronomie, wha^ he caused
the holy Bible to be turned into English, and laid it in the tabernacle,
wha^ he commanded the same to be ^aied in all and singular the churches
throughout his Royalmes and dominions: chargeyng the Levites, yt is, the
Bishops, Pastors, and Curates, in the time of the free year, yt is, at al due
and convenient seasons, to read and declare it unto al ye people gathered
together, both me^, women and children, yea and the straungiers yt were in any
his cities, yt they might hear, learn, and fear their lord God. But where
some of the priests y^ sons of Leui, had now in these last years through
their iugleyng, their false packyng, and their plain sorcerie bewitched king
Henry with a wrong persuasion, and had so craftily cou^paced and conueighed the
matier, yt under the pretense and color of religion, they kept the word of
God from the iyes and ears of the people, beatyng his most faithful loving
subjects from the knowleage thereof, with a mortal whyppe made of six deadly
knotted chordes, and in the mean time kept the book of the law hidden,
until they had so far obscured, derkened, and oppressed ye word, yt all
things were ^eplete with error and insinceritie: it now evidently appears
your Majesty to be the faithful Josias, in whose time the book of ye law is
found out in the house of the Lord, and by your most godly iniunccions read
in the hearing of all your people, and a covenant made with the Lord yt they
shall walk after the Lord, and shall keep his commandments with al their hertes
and al their souls, whereunto all your people most willyngly does consent by
glad receyuyng of all such good order and reformacion as by your Majesty's
most godly direccion is mynistred unto them. Your most noble father was the
David, who of a good heart and zele intended, yea and made mocio^ to build an
house for the Lords name: but we all trust your highness to be the Solomon,
who^ god has appointed and by special dispensacion elected to build and
finishe an house for him for ever, by restoryng and establishyng the true
Christian religion. Which thing yt your Majesty may have the grace and
spirit to do, ye lack not the perpetual wyshinges and prayers of al your
most loving and obedient subjects. The world seeing these your most princely
begynnynges in this your tender years of chyldehood, is confirmed in a sure
hop^ and expectacion yt your Majesty will in process of time grow to be in
this behalf a very Phoenix among Christian princes, and a mirror and
spectacle unto them all. And certes your Majesty is in much other case the^
other kings of England before your time have been. For where (the frowardnes
o^ fortune being such, that most part of things like as they are through
her aid and favor easy to be achiued, so the same through her malignaunt
wi^kedenes are more easy to be lost again) it deserves no less but rather
more glory well to keep and maintein things well gotten, the^ to acquyre more
to it: some of your most worthy progenitors have had a ^eadye pathway to
renoume, and have had but an easy trauail to succeed and follow ye prince next
before going in the laudable exau^ple of politic regimente, of woorthye
enterpryses, of Marciall prowess, of noble but yet common acts of chi^faltie,
of notable and famous enterprises, but yet enclosed within the coumpace of
man's reach. But your grace succeadyng Henry the eight, shall not be hable to
satisfy nor answer the earneste expectacion of the world, unless ye do
excel. Nothing may serve your grace but singularity. Ye have in his exaumple
such a mark set up unto you, as without the sweat and labors of Hercules
(of who^ the Poets feign, yt he bore up and stayghed heaven self with his
shoulders) ye shall not be hable to clyme unto. Ye must surmount and pass a
king which was in his time pierlesse, and a matter of public admiracion to
the universal world. And such are your begynnynges already, as well in
Marciall chiefalrye, as also in politi^ue ordinance of civil laws at home,
as well in destruiyng the image of Baall, and rootyng up of al Idolatry, as also
in setting a ferther good order for matters of religion: that it will not
suffice if ye be but egual to him. King Henry the eight besides his felicity
and luckie fortune in all his most Regal e^treprises as well by marcial chiefalrie
as also i^ politic governance, besides his manyfold co^questes and victories
in France, Scotland, Irelande, and else where, besides his inestimable high
triou^phes, voiages, and acts dooen both at home and beyond the seas,
besides his exceadyng great and many buyldinges of palacies, Honors,
Mainours, castles, fortresses, holds, blockhouses, havens, as well for the
strength and safegarde of his royalmes and dominions as also for ye commodity
of fre^des arryuing, and ye annoiaunce of the enemies, besides the defense and
maynteinaunce of al his ports and narowe seas with Carikes, barks, hulkes,
ships, galies, and many other high and sumptuous devises of shypwright,
besides the aboundaunt furnishing of all and singular the premises with all
kinds of ordinance, artillery, and other requisite prouysio^, besides ye
fou^dyng, edifing and erecting of an incredible noumbre of bishops Sees,
cathedral Colleges, lectures, schools, and other Colleges for students in
both vniuersitees, and so sumptuous endowyng of every of them with lands,
possessions, Jewels ornaments and all requisite furniture so much and so
large, as every one of the premysses particularly might be judged an act
sufficient in a kings time to be dooen, besides his most vigilaunt and
careful study about the enactyng of a great volume of right wholesome statutes
and laws for the commodity and behoufe, of the public weal of England and
his other dominions, and among these, his vnceassaunte endeavor about a
reformacion in religion, and therein (as a thing most necessary for all commonweals tendreing Christ's glory,) the extirpyng and abolishynge of the
detestable usurpation of the papacy of Rome, the rootyng up of all sects of
cloisterers, of all countrefaicte religyon, and of Idolatry, together with the
setting forth of the holy Scripture in the vulgar English tongue, besides all
these premysses and other his acts mo then a long time may suffyse to
rehearse, king Henry was a Prince of singular prudence, of passing stout
courage, of magnanimitee incomparable, of invincible fortitude, of notable
actiuitee of dexteritee woondreful. He was a continual wellyng fountain of
eloquence, a very rare spectacle of humanity, of ciuilytie or good nourture
an absolute presidente, a special pattern of clemency and moderacion, a
worthy exaumple of regal justice, a botomlesse spring of largess and
benignity. He was in all the honest arts and faculties profou^dely seen, in all
liberal disciplines egual with ye chiefest, in no kind of litterature inexpert.
He was to y^ world an ornamente, to his country a treasoure, to his friends a
coumforte, to his foes a terroure, to his faithful and loving subjects a
tender father, to innocents a sure protector, to wylfull malefactors a sharp
scourge, to his common weal and good people a quiet haven and ancore of
safegarde, to the distourbers of the same a rock of exterminion, in heinous
and intolerable crimes against the public weal a severe judge, in the like
offenses committed against himself a ready port and refuge of mercy, except
to such as would persiste incorrigible. A man he was in all gifts of nature,
of fortune, and of grace, piereles, and (shortly to break of in a matter of it
self infinite,) a man above al praises. Such a king has God set up before
your Majesty for an exaumple, a spectacle, and a pattern of al princely
virtues whom egually to match, will be with the very lest that is looked
for of these your most Regal and Christian begynnynges in this your tender
age. For mete it is that like as your highness is heir and successor of your
most noble fathers croune and treasures, even so much more be ye heir of his
most princely virtues: and like as ye would employ al possible industry, and
diligence to maynteine and ampliate the external possessions of your empier,
even so to augmente the virtues of the mind, being the more precious
possession of the twayn. Neither is there in this behalf on our parties, your
Matestees most beneuolent and faithful loving subjects, any less hope to be
conceived of you for that yt is to come, then we do already feel joy and
coumforte of that we see present. For such excellent begynnynges being
ferthered by the public and daily prayers of al your faithful and true herted
subjects, cannot but have still better and better degrees of continuance and
encreace, especially having such noble and sapient Counsaillours as it has
pleased God to provide for you, and to give you in this your tender babehood.
For that all such well doings in young kings, and by reason thereof
prosperous success in all things, proceeds of faithful and godly
Counsaillours: it may evidently appear by the notable exaumples of the two
young kings of Israel Manasses and Josias. Whosoever will peruse the books of
the kings, shall find that from the beginning of Achabs reygne until the
time of good king Ezechias, true holiness, religion, right knowleage of God,
yea and the veraye mind to weorke or seek Gods glory, lay as a thing
oppressed, rejected, buried, and vttrely extyncte, and instead of Godliness
reigned al iniquity: in lieu of true knowlage, all was possessed with
ignorance and error: in place of true wurshyppyng of God, so far prevailed
Idolatrye and contempt of Gods laws, that Israel passed the Gentyles not
only in their own gentylitie of wurshypping Baal and many false Gods, but
also in all other kinds of their most detestable abhominacions. The crafty and
subtle iugleyng of Baals priests, and of the false prophets for the
aduauncyng of their own lucre and estimacion, had under the color and
pretense of holiness, and of religion, by little and little so allured,
enueigled, coniured, and bewitched the princes: yt they were utterly blinded
and seduced to condescende to the wicked and covetous inuencions of the
priests. They persuaded the Princes to their ways by policies, they bestowed
all their cunning clergy, and weorkema^shyp of peincted eloquence, until they
had perverted them and drawn them clean a straygh from all the ways of the
Lord their true God, well knowing that the people, some for love, some for
fear, and some through exau^ple, would without any buisinesse follow the
trace and ledyng of their king and governor. They made the kings and rewlers
sure on their side, well wetyng that the subjects, some for obedience sake of
their own accord would, and the rest by their cruel diuises might by tyranny
be enforced to draw after their Princes line. Whereof the ancient proverb
says, that every king is to his royalme and subjects either a singular
precious benefit, orels a very pernicious destruction, because yt such as
every king is, such will his people be. Wherefore like as a werte or a molle
standing in a bodies face is a more blemyshe, a greatter deformitee, and a
wurse disgracing, then if it stood in some privy place of the body, where
either the providence of nature hides it, or man's own reverence and good
provision does keep it secret: so is a vice or any eiuil qualytie a more
fault and a greatter dishonor in a Prince, then in an other private person,
because that every his saying; doing, yea and every his look and gesture, is
taken up as a public exaumple and pattern for all his subjects to follow: so
that the kings of Israel could not be civil, but to the veraie pernycious
ensaumple and corrupcion of al their sely people. But at length came good king.
Ezechias, of whom the Scripture in his due commendacion testifies, that he did
that pleased the Lord in all thing, like to his forefather and progenitour
Dauyd. His well doings he begoonne with the redress of religion, and the
extirpyng of idolatry up by the rote. For while idolatry reigned, nothing could
he do ye might be pleasyng to God. First of all therefore he put away the hill
alters, and brake the images and cut down y^ groves, and all to brake the
brazen serpente that Moses had made. (For unto those days ye children of
Israel did burn sacrifice unto it. Nume* xxi.
) He trusted in the Lord God of Israel, he claue to the Lord and departed not
from him, but kept his commandments, and the Lord was with him, so that he
prospered in all things which he took in hand. etc. Thus, during ye time of
his reygne by ye space of twenty nine years, he renewed religion and restored
the law of God to his perfeccion: he reduced his people to the trade of holy
and vpryght conversation in the sight of God, of walkyng in the commandments
of the Lord, detesting al Idolatrye and abhorryng al such abomynacions as
might justly provoke his wrath and vengeance. All this while the subtyl and
crafty false prophets and priests of Baall dissembled and played mum, they
followed the necessitee of the time, and for fear of the iron rod, did as the
world under such a king required. But as soon as good king Ezechias was once
dead, leauyng behind hyme his soonne Manasse, a child of twelve years old to
reygne by succession over Israel in his stead, than the false prophets and
priests of Baall thought it a fit and propyes time to show themselves in
their own colors. As soon as by his death a gappe was opened to their false
iugleyng, to their crafty practyse, to their wyly dryftes, and their subtyle
conueyghaunce, they a^o^ showed their affeccions as they were. They leat not
slyppe their occasion ^o reduce Israel to the former trade of dooyng sacrifice
to the Idolles which they had learned in the time of wieked Achab, whereby
their lucre and advantage had a long season come in thick, and under
Ezechias utterly decayed, in whose days they we^ of force compelled to have
the law of God in honor, and the same only to use and to ^eache to the
people. In heart privily they still continued most detestable and most
pernicyous favorers, maynteyners and weorkers of Idolatrye, though they had
for the time through hypocrisy and for fear of punishemente intermytted
the same. But ye youth of Manasse being a babe easy to be enticed allured and
trained to the lusts of sensuality, through flatreyng persuasions, and being
destitute of faithful and godly counsayllours that might and would protect
his tender chyldehood, and bring him up in the knowledge of God, in the way of
his precepts, was for the said false Prophets, and covetous priests of
Baall a mete pray. Him therefore they enueygled with many sweet words of
flaterye (doubt ye not) with many words of coumforte, with much
circumstaunce of glorious peincted eloquence, with allegeyng of many politic
consideracions, with many ciuyll respects of ye state of the world yt than
was, with many ga^e and solemn promises of innumerable and the same right high
commodities that should thereby ensue to him and his common weal, with many
assured warauntises of wealth, peace and tranquillity, if he would use their
counsayl in following the ways of wise Achab, being (as they alleged) a noble
Prince, and a polityque wise man in following ye trade of his forefathers, and
not of such a newefound t^ade of learning and religion as Ezechias had lately
invented and brought up in Israel, to the great troublyng and disquieting of
himself, the grievous annoiau^ce and vexacion of his subjects, and the extreme
peril of his common weal. For Almanazar king of Assyria had in the days of
Ezechias come up against Samaria, and besieged it, and woonne it, and had
carried away Israel into Assyria: and after him Sennacheryb king of Assyria
had come up against all ye strong cities of Judah, and had taken them: albeit
God by his power delivered Ezechias and his people and Cities, and the Au^gel
of the Lord slew of the proud blasphemous braggui^g Assiria^s, an hundred
four score and five thousand at a clappe. By these means ye salse prophets
and wicked priests of Baall cou^pace and weigh young Manasse though he
succeeded his own father being so good and so godly a king as y^ express
testimony of holy scripture commends with these words, that after him was
none like him among all the kings of Judah, neither were there any such before
him: yet ye not wtsta^ding by ye suger-mouthed false prophets, and by the
covetous priests of Baall through defaulte of good and godly Counsayllours,
whom (doubt ye not but this wieked rabble found means to wring out of
favor, and to remove away from the Kings presence) he was so coumpaced,
iiii. king. xxi.
weighed, persuaded, woonne, be wytched, perverted and so fo^re seduced: yt (as
the scripture records), he did eiuil in the sight of the Lord even after the
abominacyons of the heathen. For he went and buylt the hill altares, which
Ezechias his father had destruied, and he reared up alters for Baall, and made
groves (as did Achab King of Israel) and wurshipped all the host of heaven
and served them. And he builte alters in the house of the Lord, of which the
Lord had said: In Jerusalem will I put my name. And he buylte alters for
all the host of heaven: even in two Courts of the Lord. And he offered his
soonnes in fire, and gave head unto witchecrafte and sorcery, and mayntayned
weorkers with spirits, and tellers of fortunes: and wroughte much wickedness
in y^ sight of the Lord to anger him. And he put an image of a grove that he
had made, even in the Temple, of which the Lord had said to David and Solomon
his son: in this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chose out of all the
tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever. And Manasse led them out of
the way, to do more wickedlye then did the hethen people, whom the Lord
destroyed from before the children of Israel, and he wrought more wyekedly
then all the Amorytes, which were before him, did: and made Judah also to sin
with his Idolles and did shed innocent blood excedyng much even till he
replenished Jerusalem from corner to corner with the blood of the true
Prophets, and of as many as might be found to be the true worshyppers of God
and sincere kepers of ye law. After so wicked a father, (who reigned fiftye
five years in Jerusalem) succeeded as wicked a son Amon, being twenty two
years old when he begoo^ne to reign. iiii. king. xxi.
And he likewise did evil in ye sight of ye Lord, as his father Manasse had
done, and walked in all the way yt his father walked in, and served ye Idolles
that his father served, and wurshypped them. And he forsook the Lord God of
his fathers, and walked not in the way of the Lord. etc. When Amo^ was
deceassed, his soo^ne Josias was in his stead made King, iiii. king, xxi.
and was but eight years old when he was enoyncted King. And where he reigned
thyrtie one years, and begone to reign so young: yet (as the scripture
plainelye mency oneth) he did that which is right in the sight of the Lord,
and walked in all the ways of David his forefather, and boughed neither to the
right hand ne to the self, undoubtedly through the special grace of God,
and the help of good Governors, who well considering and ponderynge the
ungodly life and doings of Manasse, could not of their fydelytye find in
their hertes to suffer such an innocent babe in like sort to be seduced and
abused as Manasse had been, iiii. king. xxi.
both to his own perdicion, and also to the utter desolacion of Jerusalem and
Judah: For behold (said the Lord) because Manasse King of Judah, has done
such abhominacyons. etc. I will bring such eiuyls upon Jerusalem and Judah,
that whosoever hears of it, both his ears shall tinkle: and I will wipe out
Jerusalem, iiii king. xxii.
as a man wipeth a dish and when, he has wiped it, turns it vpsyde down.
etc. And to Josias thus answers the Lord by the prophetisse in the fowerth
of the Kings: Because thine heart did melte, and because thou have humbled thy
self before me the lord when thou heardest what I spoke against this place.
etc. Behold therefore I will receive thee unto thy fathers, and thou shall be
put into thy grave in peace, and thine iyes shall not see all the eiuils which I
will bring upon this place. They were both of them young Kings, and immediate
successors, the one to Ezechias who had extirped idolatry by the root, and
the other to a wurshipper of false Gods, and otherwise also a very wicked man:
And yet Manasse through perverse enticers fell from God to all naughtines, and
Josias being younger of age then he, did by the help of faythefull and godly
Counsaylours, apply himself to all goodness, and thereby prospered. These two
very notable exaumples, most gracious Soueraygne, I have some what the more at
large propouned and set forth to your Majesty: partly that ye may mark and
(...) shall of your godly doings redounde to youreselfe, your people, (...)
Royalmes and dominyons, yea and to your posterity also for your sake: and
partly to declare unto your highness, that next to the special gift of
Gods grace, to be of your own good disposicion plyanne, flexible, and much
inclined to virtue: the chief and principal portion of all such good hap
is to be ascribed to the discrete governance, the sapient direccion, the
virtuous trayning, the upright guydyng, the godly aduertisementes, the wholesome
admonicions, and the vncorrupt educacion in virtue and litterature ministered
unto a young king by feithful and worthy Counsayllours. Which thing forasmuch
as it so is, how happy and blyssed is your Majesty of gods own hand, who
has provided your Grace of such noble and worthy Counsaylours in this time
of your minority: and how much are we your most feithful loving subjects
bound to laud, praise and magnify his most holy name, for that in this so
dangerous a time he has so mercifully and graciously provided for us, whose
wealth and safeguard in this world must wholly and only depend of your godly
educacion and virtuous trainyng, or our extreme confusion of the contrary? And
certes this your innocent babehood and tender minority, is the veraie time, in
which it may evidently be tried what persons do feithfully tender your wealth,
your honor, and your godly procedinges. They are above all precious Iewelles
and above all worldely treasoures to be esteemed, loved, regarded, thanked, and
followed of your Majesty, which in this your mynoritie show themselves
feithfull, earnest, diligent and careful* not only as touching the safegarde
and preseruacion of your most Royal person, but also concerning your mind in
this your te^dre youngth to be furnished with literature, with the due knowledge
of God, and with such disciplines as many confirm you in all Princely virtues
for your honor, wealth and renoume, when God shall make you a man of yetes
and stature, as your most noble and most honorable Counsaylours do their
true and diligent endeavor to make you a man in maniers and learning. Wherein
like as Philip King of Macedonie at the birth of his son Alexandre the great,
alleged himself for two causes principally to rejoice, the one because he had
now a son borne to succeed him in his croune and scepter, and the other
because the same was borne in the time of so noble a Clerk as Aristotle was,
to whom the tuicyon, governance, and instruction of Alexandre, might be
committed, so did your most noble father, and so do al we your most beneuolent
subjects yet still rejoice, that your hap was to be borne having two such
worthy uncles to serve and assist you, and especially such an one as your most
dear uncle Edward Duke of Somerset is, to whom as well the governance and
virtuous institucion and training of your most Royal person as also the
proteccyon of all your Roialmes and dominions and of al us your most feithfull
loving subjects during the time of this your minority, might be safly
committed. Of whose fidelity now a long season as well in King Henry's time as
sense the beginning of your Majesty's most noble and victorious Reign
thoroughly tried, and the same as well in peace as also in soondry wars
approved, neither at home only, but also both in france and Scotland more then
once or twice declared: of whose dexterity as well in marcial feactes as also in
civil affairs, and in ordring of the common weal: of whose fortunate and
luckie speed in all his worthy enterpryses: of whose happy and prosperous
success in all things that he takes in hand: of whose passing great
clemencye and moderacy on toward all people in every behalf: of whose
prudence in all civil matiers: of whose feithful and vigilaunte administracion
under your Majesty in your common weal: of whose indifferency in all causes
of justice to be ministered to your people: of whose most upright integrity not
only in civil counsayles, but also in matiers of religion for the word of God
purely and sincerely to be set forth to Gods glory, and to the wealth and honor
of your Emperial croune and dignity, though no man is hable to say overmuch:
yet will I rather absteyne to say that I could and justly might do, then I
will fill his ears with the troumpe of his own particular praises, which I
know him to be nothing desirous ne willing to hear. Only I shall pray
almyghtie God (as al England and your other dominions with public and the
same vnceassaunt prayers do) to preserve and keep him, until such time as your
Majesty being grown to full manstate and absolute discrecion, may reward him
with condign thanks for his long and the same most feithful and diligent
service, and the same thing also to do unto all the other your most noble and
godly Counsaylours. For the blisfull state that your Majesty endeavors and
daily trauayleth with their assent and consent to set this your Empiere in,
enforces as many as love either you or God, daily to break out into this
acclamacion: O happy King, of such worthy Counsailours, and o happy
Counsailours of such a toward King. Neither do we your most beneuolent
subjects any thing doubt, but that your Majesty's godly beginninges so
prosperously and earnestly to set forth Gods word and glory, shall daily more
and more occasyon al Christian kings and princes not only to spoil the
Romish Egypt by resuming every one his own most due and tightful title of
supreme head within his own Royalmes and dominions, and by abolishing ye
usurped primacie of the papacy of Rome with all the Antichristian tradicions
issuing from the same, but also in publishing the pure and sincere word of God
to their peoples and subjects every one. And than is it not to be doubted, but
that Christian love, peace, unity, and concord, which has long and many
years through the malicious practicing of the Sea of Rome been exiled and
banished from al parttes of Christendom, shall universally in a momente
return again to the great glory of God, to the quieting of the world, to the
benefit of all Christen commonweals, and to the confusion and
discoumfeightyng as well of the Turks, as also of al other the enemies of God
and good people. And within your Majesty's Royalmes and dominions it is in the
mean time nothing to be mistrusted, but that by your most gracious provision,
such knowlage of Gods word shall grow, that your people shall be to al others a
perfeict ensaumple of all godly conuersacyon and behaueour. And where Ezechias
and Josias mayntayned true religion and the upright wurshipping of God, but
either for his own time and no longer, I trust your Grace shall confirm and
establish it for ever in the hertes and bowels of all your most tender loving
subjects. Wheru^to certes there cannot be any so ready or sure a way, as by
publishing the holy scripture and gospel of Christ and by establishing the use
thereof through most wholesome ordeinau^ces, statutes, laws, iniunccions,
sincere preachers, most godly omelies, and exposicions, in the vulgar tongue.
And in this behalf, if common writers in trifling profane matiers do with much
high suit make means to obtain and use the favorable acceptacion of Princes,
under whose name, title, and proteccion any such weorke may be the more
commended and the better habled unto the readers: how much are we al bound to
your highness, who of your own mere good zele and of your own accord, do
willingly set forth in the English tongue such fruictfull books whereby all
your people may be edified in religion. Among which verily I know not any one
book, whom for this purpose of briefly, pithily, sincerely, and familiarely
expouning the new testament, I may justly compare, or at least wise prefer to
this present Paraphrase of Erasmus, which like as the most virtuous lady
Queen Katerine late wife of your most noble father, and now of your right
derebeloued uncle Sir thomas Seimour knight, Lord Seimour of Sudley, and high
admyrall of your Seaes, did right graciously procure to be translated into our
vulgar tongue, so your Majesty more graciously has by your most godly
iniunccio^s willed to be read, used, and studied by every curate and pryeste to
the undoubted edifying as well of them, as of all other that with a desire to
know God, shall either read or hear the same. For as a wynnower powereth the
chafe from the corn, and the boulter tries out the branne from the mele: so
has Erasmus scoured out of all the Doctors and commentaries upon Scripture,
the dregs which through the fault of the times or places, in which those
writers lived, had settled it self among the pure and fine substance: he
has tried out the refuse that cleued in any the weorkes of such as wrote when
the doctrine began by patchyng and clokyng to decline to insynceritie: the
trashe and bagguage stuff that through papistical tradicions had found a way
to crepe in, this man has sifted out from the right doctrine: so that as well in all other his most clerkely wrytinges, as also most specially in these his
Paraphrases upon the new testament so auncientely written as cannot be emended
he brings in and briefly compriseth the pith of a^l the minds and meninges
of all the good Doctors of ye church, that ever wrote. In iustificacion of
feith, in honoring God only, in repentance and purity of a Christen man's
life, in detesting of imagery and corrupt honoring of Saints, in opening
and defacing the tyranny, the blasphemy, Hypocrisy, the ambicion, the
usurpation of the Sea of Rome, in noting the abuses of all the abominable
sects and rables of counterfei^te religions and idle cloisters, in bewraiing
the iugling sleightes and fine practice of popery, in choice of meats, in
esteming the difference of days, in manifesting of vain ceremonies under the
color and pretense of holiness crept into Christ's church, in reprehending
pilgrimages with all circumstances of ydolatrie and supersticion, in describing
of a Princes office, in teaching obedyence of the people toward their rulers
and Governors, in declaring of a pastors duty, in showing the part of an
Eua^gelical preacher, and what or how his doctrine ought to be out of the
Scriptures, in blasing the Antichristian decrees of popery under the name of
tradicions and constitucio^s of our mother church, in decising the right
difference between the spirit and the lettre, and finally in all other poinctes
or articles of our religion, having now of late years ben in controversy,
Erasmus like as he is no where over vehement, so is he every where both sincere
and full. Neither does any writer more wittily, more earnestly, more ap^ly,
more finely, more substauncially, more piththily, or more plainly describe and
peyncte out the usurped estate, preeminence, and pomp of the bishope of Rome,
then he does: as well in all other places where just occasion offers it self,
as also directely (though under a preaty couloure) in the eleventh chapitur of
the Evangelist Mark. Erasmus ferthermore is wondreful in comparing of fygures
of the old testamente, in applying of allegories, in declaring of parables, in
discussing of doubtful questions, in serching and explicating of profound
mysteries, wherein he evidently declares himself, that he was a man of an
excellent wit, of much study, of exquisite learning, of profounde knowelage,
of an exact judgment, of notable diligence, of worthy and famous industry,
of singular peinefulnes, of an encomparable memory, and of an inestimable zele
toward yt setting forth of Christ's most holy gospel. And yet does he with
such prudence and semely circu^speccion so te^per his style, that his very
enemies (as he cannot lack enemies enough whosoever will be an opener and
teller of ye truth in matiers of religion, he cannot lack envy of Satan's
broad, whosoever will endeavor himself to ferther the knowlage of Gods word, he
cannot lack neither privy backebiting nor yet open reproach to slaundre him,
to bring him out of credit, to deface him, to trede him under foot, whosoever
will be diligent to help bring the gospel to light* he shall not avoid to be
openly burdened with false crimes whereby he may be vttrely diffamed, whosoever
will travail to manifest the glory of Christ's blood: he shall have enough to
write and speak against him, whosoever will attempt to discover the iugling
castes and practice of popery:) his very enemies (I say that hated him because
they hated the verity, could never yet find how to give him any foil, or how
to take thaduantage of any such hold against him, whereby to confound his
doctrine. Nevertheless when I do in my mind make a comparison of you three
together, Erasmus in writing this Paraphrase, Queen Katerine in procuring ye
same to be turned into English, and your highness in publishing the same by your
godly iniunccions to be had in use throughout all parties of this Royalme, me
seems I do well note Erasmus to have done the lest act of the three. For
Erasmus fact did help only such as are seen in latin: the Queen's goodness
extends to the help of the unlearned also which have more need of helping
foreward: and your Majesty's benefit it is* that makes so precious a treasour
common to as many as may take profit or fruict thereby. And in deed no
Christian Prince there is, to whom the tuicion, proteccion, and stablishing of
any such books or weorkes, as concern the pure setting forth of Christ and
his gospel, does so aptely or so duly apperteine, as to your most excellent
Majesty, to whom by a most just and right deuolucion, and discente of
inheritance of the crounes of England, France, and Ireland, the title also of
Defe^dour of the feith, does most nerely, most peculiarely, most specially, and
most directly belong. Now as touching the translatours of such books as this,
although I have at this present the less to say, because I my self have in a
small portion of this weorke filled one room of some other man that might have been hable to do it better then I have done: yet can I not but wish that among
so many your Majesty's most ^umple and bount^ous exhibicions, and so many
other godly acts to be done as are daily brought and offered to the gracious
direccio^ of your highness, of your most dear* uncle being Governor of your
Royal person during this time of your minority, and under your Majesty our
protector, and of the other your most honorable Cou^saillours this thing also
might be peferred to your consideracions, how necessary a thing it were, that
some hable, worthy and mete persons for doing such public benefit to the
common weal as translating of good weorkes, and writing of Cronicles, might by
some good provision and means have some condign sustentacion in the same. For
what Royalme almost (England excepted) has not al ye good authors that ever
wrote translated into the mother tongue, whereby the people are made prudent and
expert men in the tract of all affaire^, either touching any discipline or else
any civil matiers? And in Germany, what good weorke of divinity is there,
which they have not in their own language to the inestimable edifying of the
people in ye due knowlage of God? For what has been or is in any common weal
the foundation of spreading abroad the knowlage of Gods word, but only the
setting forth of the Bible with other good and godly tractises for the
declaracion of the same? What thing has ye whelps of ye Romish Antichrist so
fiercely always backed against, as at the translating of Scripture and other
books concerning matiers of religion into the vulgar tongue for the use of ye
people? What any one thing is there, against the which there has in all
Christen Royalmes (as long as it might prevail) been either sorer decrees,
laws, or inhibicions ordained, or more terrible execucion of all kinds of
torments and deaths invented, devised and put in ure, then against the
setters forth of books concerning religyon? What one thing has papistry in
all countries more eagrely conspired, more subtelly coumpaced, or more
earnestly practiced to oppress: then the coming forth of Scripture and other
divine weorkes in the vulgar tongue, whereof the rude multitude might gather
knowlage? Against what thing has there in these last years, until Christ
(like fire being hidden under wood) would needs mount up and appear abroad
maugre ye head of the Romish Pharao and al his tyranny, against what thing (I
say) has there been either more sorer thundreboltes shot, of deprauing, of
accursing, of slaundreing, of defacing, of condemning, and of burning: then
against books of scripture matiers, translated or written in the mother
language, and against the autours of the same? Until the Bible and other good
traitises for ye explanacio^ of ye same were in Christian regions turned and set
forth in the vulgar languages: what kind of idolatry, supersticio^, popery,
error, ignorance, or counterfeict religion, did not reign? As long as the
candel light of the gospel was kept hidden under the bushel: what King, what
Prince, what country, what people did not the blind popish guides led (as one
that is blindfolde may be led) till both fell in the pit? But when and
whersoeuer it has pleased God by his special mercy, grace, and providence to
show open the light of the gospel and true doctrine: there has at once all
popish troumperie even of it self vanished away, as a mist is dispersed with
the heat of the son, as smoke is consumed in the aier, as duste is blown
and scattered abroad with a puff of wind, as the night gives place to the
bright day, and as darkness vanishes at the clear light of the su^ne.
Contrariewise where the word of God can not yet geat any entry to take place,
ne the books of holy Scripture obtein to be published to the people, what iye
does not see, and what Christian heart does not lament and blede, to consider in
what blindness, supersticion, error, unquietness of conscience and trouble of
mind, the sely people do live? It is therefore no small benefit that such
persons do to a common weal, which are willingly trauaillers in this kind of
writing. For as for new books of trifleing vanities and profane arguments we
need none, there are daily so many written: but to have such weorkes made common
to the public use of ye unlearned multitude, as are the principal best, and
have been written by noble Clerks of vndoudted learning, knowlage, and
godliness, therein consists such a public benefit, as (if I should not now
be suspected and demed to hunt for my self) is in mine estimacion, worthy
public thanks and regard. For (as Erasmus in his third book of Apothegmes,
as well by a sapient answer of Socrates, as also by two other preatie stories,
the one of Leonicenus and the other of William Warham late Archbishop of
Cantorbury does declare) much more good, and a much greater benefit to a
common weal does such an one, as translateth or composeth any frui^tful book
or traictise, which by going abroad throughout a whole Royalme may profit all
pastors, curates students, and al people universally: then any man is hable
to do by preaching teaching, or giving instruccions to one company alone, or in
one place or country and no mo, though he should never so rightly, never so
diligently, or never so cu^ningly do the same. Now besides that such a
translatour trauaileth not to his own private commodity, but to the behoufe
and public use of his country: besides that the thing is such as must so
thoroughly occupy and possess the dooer, and must have him so attent to apply
that same exercise only, that he may not during that season take in hand any
other trade of business whereby to purchase his living: besides that the thing
cannot be done without bestowing of long time, great watchyng, much peines,
diligente study, no small charges as well of meat, drink, and books, as also
of other necessa^ies, the labor self is of it self a more peinful and a more
tedyous thing, then for a man to write or prosecute any argument of his own
inuencion. A man has his own inuencion ready at his own pleasure without
lettes or stoppes to make such discourse as his argument requires: but a
translatour must of force in manier at every other word staigh, and suspend
both his cogitacio^ and his pen to look upon his autour, so that he might in
egual time make thrice so much, as he ca^ be hable to translate. But whether
of both a man shall apply himself to do, he can in the mean while do nothing
else, he cannot-duryng the season bestow himself on any other occupacio^ for
his living, and his necessities and also charges in the mean time
nevertheless do grow as well as other men's. Whereof it comes to pass, that
a noumbre of such as would be right willing and diligent to do good in the
common weal with this kind of service: yet through defaulte of necessary
maintenance, cannot: and certain that has both living and vacaunt time
enough, for as much as they see the pains of this trauile so great, the hyre
nothing at al, and the capciousnes of some maligners against the truth, so
ready to deprave the diligent labor of studious writers: are for the most
part of the^ better contented (according to the accustomed proverb) to play
for naught then to weorke for naught. And by this means lie almost all good
books hidden from the people, and al disciplines unknown. But thus having
under the gracious sufferaunce and correction of your Majesty showed my poor
opinion, I su^cesse any ferther to traict of this matter, lest I might seem to
speak as mine own friend, which in deed I do not, in so much that having
your Majesty's benign favor thereunto, I mind and entende no less, then al
my life enduring either in writing or translating, to employe my simple
talente, according to the portion which it has pleased almighty god to
measure unto me: Albeit in this present weorke, nothing it is that I do or
justly may take unto me as mine act, saving the translacion of the
paraphrase upon Luke, and the digesting and placing of the text throughout all
the ghospelles, and the acts (except the ghospel of Mark) to thentent the
unlearned readers may perceive where and how the process and circu^staunce of
the paraphrase answers to ye text, and how it ioineth therewith. Which my
rude and gross doing if it may please your highness for the respect of my
good will and honest zele to pardone (for as for thank I confess my self to
have worthily deserved none for so rude a thing:) your Maiestyes benign and
gracious favor shall be unto me such an encouraging and spur toward
ferther industry: that among the rich iewelles of other better learned men's
studies, who have abou^daunce of treasoures to co^ferre and bestow to the
publ^que edifiyng of the ignorant people, I shall at no time be ^lacke even of
my penury and scarcity to bring my poor ferthing also, and to cast it into
the common box of helpyng the ignorant multitude toward more knowelage of
god. For truly there is none so good, so sure, ne so ready a way to plant the
knowelage of God in men's hertes, to engraue in me^ true love and obedience
toward their Princes and rewlers, to rote up idolatry and supersticio^ out
of me^nes stomakes, to bring the people in ye good mind to detest and abhor
al kind of naughtines, to bring al folks to a perfeict security of
conscience in Christ's blood, to reduce the people to an upright trade of
Christian religion: as to feed their gredie houngre and thirst of Christ's
righteousness, with the Bible, with such godly omilies, and with this
paraphrase and other like books of wholesome doctrine, as your Majesty's zele and
deuocio^ toward god has already moved you to do. For of this young and grene
foundation being yet very newly laid, thus much good edifying has already
grown in all persons consciences: that blasphemy, perjury, mourdre, theft,
whoordome, making of affraies, and other abhominacions are more detested, then
they were in the blind world very late years gone: which is a token, that
Christ begins to dwell among us. For as Christ grows, so shall vice wear
away. And by egual degrees shall the love of virtue and the hatered of vice grow
in our hertes. A great mayny that have hated matrimony, and yet have not hated
fornicacion, inceste, and aduoutry, begin now to abhor and manifestly to flee
these and other like pestilences, and to exercise the contraries. Which thing
if some persons shall percase deny, and affirm to be otherwise, truly in mine
opinion it is not so, but because it is in so great a number emended, look
where such corrupcion still remains, there does it better and more notably
appear, as strange things are commonly more wondered at. For all good and godly
folk do now wondre, that, Gods word being spread abroad and being now almost
in every bodies hand and mouth so common, there should be any creature in whom
any of the enormities before mentioned should reign. But by Gods grace and
your Majesty's most wholesome provision it is to be hoped, that through this
salve of Gods word, and other devout weorkes for declaracion of the same
set forth to the people, if any sheep either be scabby, or else do yet ren
astraygh: the same shall by the right ledyng of the head belle weather their
Prince, and by the whystle and voice of their good Pastors, be reduced to
such a concord and uniformity, that they will full and whole go the straight
pathway of Christ's doctrine, until (according to his promise) there shall of
us al be but one fold, and one shepeheard, as your most excellent Majesty by
setting forth such books as may edify your people of all states and degrees
in the knowlage of gods word and in innocence of life does labor to have
it. Which your godly purpose and desire (if I may with your gracious pardone
say mine opinyon) I verayly suppose that no creature is of such wicked heart
to hindre, except if any such there be, (which thing God of his great mercy
and grace forbid) that would not with his good will have your highness so well
to prosper, flourish, and grow, as to the honor and glory of God, to the
coumfort and rejoicing of all your well willers, to the terror and dread of all
your foes, and to the wealth and honor of all your Royalmes and dominions (God
be thanked) ye now do. And doubt you not most excellent Soueraygne, but
that so long as your Majesty by the advice and assistence of your said most
dear uncle and the other your most honorable Counsailours, shall tendrely
seek and setforth Gods glory, framing and trayning your people to walk in his
precepts: so long will God prosper you in all affairs, who can no more be
false of his promise, then he can cease to be God. If ye read the fifth
chapitur of Iosue, and the fifth chapitur of Judith, (besides many places more
as well in the books of the kings, as also in other books of the Scriptures)
ye shall plainly find how merueilously God protected, saved, prospered, and
preserved the people of Israel, so long as they walked in his precepts truly
and sincerely wurshipping him and keeping his laws, against all the force and
vyolence of all their enemies, were they never so innumerable, never so
puissaunt, never so well appointed for battayl, nor never so fierce. In the
fifth chapitur of Judith among other notable testimonies of Gods tendrenes over
Israel, and by their example over al such as truly serve him, it is contained,
that when word came to Holofernes, Prince and Captain general of the war of
the Assirians under the king Nabugodonozor, how the children of Israel prepared
themselfes, to make resistance against him and his army Royal, and he
demanded many questions of the Princes of Moab and of the Captains of Ammon
concerning the power of the Israelites: Achior the Captain of all the
Ammonites, when he had in a long process declared unto Holofernes how
wo^drefully Israel, when they truly served god, had evermore from time to time
been preserved, and had prevailed against all their enemies, and contrary
wise how God had always plagued them whansoeuer they fell from him to
wurshippe false Gods: thus does he conclude and knitte up his oracion.
Therefore my lord (says he) make diligent inquisicion: If this people have
done wiekednes in the sight of their God, than let us go up against them.
For doubtless their God will deliver them into thy hands, and subdue them
unto thy power. But if this people have not displeased their God, we shall not
be hable to withstand them. For their God will defend them, and so shall we be a
shame to all the world. etc. I therefore with all tendrenes of heart, beseech
almighty God that this your godly purpose of setting forth the word and glory
of god, (whereunto his most holy spirit, first moved your most noble father,
and has now more strongly and effectually wrought the same in your Majesty,)
may never slack. And than I nothing doubt, but that, according to the most
earnest and the same vnceassaunt prayers, not only of all us your most
feithful loving subjects, but also of all other good and godly people, he shall
in all things most prosperously continue your most noble and most gracious
Reign over us, pouring and heaping into you, as into a vessel of singular
prerogative peculiarely chosen, the right and true administracion of his laws
and of your common weal, which by his special grace he gave unto Moses and
unto Iosue: the like testimony of feithfulnes, Exodus xviii Deu. xxxi. and Joshua.

and of being a man chosen after his own heart, which he gave unto king
David: the singular gift of wisdom richesse, magnificence, and renoume,
wherewith he notably above al others endewed king Solomon: the fortunate and
prosperous success in battayl (if necessity of war must come unto you) that
he sent unto Abia: no less integrity and pureness of living joined with
effectual taking a way of supersticion, then the scripture reports of good
king Asa: the same grace to set your people in good order, and to constytute
echewhere within your Royalmes and dominions, prudent, upright, and discrete
Magistrates to minister justice, and to have God with you in all affairs
therefore, as we read of noble king Iosophat: the like prosperity and
continuance of most victorious reigning that God sent unto Ioathan king of
Israel: the like addicion of years to your natural time, ii. Parali^, x^^i,

that Ezechias had: and finally the luckie and prosperous old age, which God
gave unto Abraham, with semblable hap for propagacion of sede for your
succession by such a noble Sara as may be a condign spouse to be coupled with
so noble a King. Whereunto al true English hearts that shall fortune to read
or hear these presents I doubt not will with one voice say. Amen.

To the Ientle christian reader Nicolas Udal wishes health, grace, and peace
in God the father, and in his son Jesus Christ our salueour
THou have here, good Christian reader, the paraphrase of Erasmus upon ye
gospel, that is to say, a treasour and in manier a full library of all good
divinity books. For whatsoever thing any of the ancient doctors of the
church left behind him, whatsoever in any catholic writer is contained,
whatsoever any notable good exposytoure has set forth for the sincere and
plain declaracion of the new testament: the pith and substance thereof has
this man with a clerkely judgment compendiously and briefly, as it were in a
sum, couched together in this one weorke. Neither was there ever any weorke
so easy to be understood of the reader, which has more cunning showed in it,
as by his own annotacions upon his tra^slacion of the new testament it may
evidently appear, in which annotacions he approves and declares himself with
such diligent obseruacion and marking to have perused al libraries, al writers,
al books: as very few students do use to read and labor any one autour in
any one particular faculty or discipline. Accept this autour therefore, devout
reader, and with glad will enbrace so profitable a mean and instrument, whereby
thou may (without any ferther trauail then only reading marking, and bearing
it away,) so easily attain to the clear understanding of ye gospel. Read it
with a pure and a charitable heart and with a single iye void of al manner
parcialitie of affeccion or of envy: and thou shall espy therein such edifying,
as may be mete for thy state of knowlage and aptitude or capacity, what euel
it be. For like as in ye most holy and blissed testament there is both pappe
for you^g^inges in the feith and in the knowlage of Gods word, and also sound
meat for such as are well entered and hable to broke higher things: even so in
this auctour, are al things aptly tempered to enduce and train the gross and
the rude multitude as well of Curates and teachers* as also of other private
readers: to feed ye weak with such doctrine as they are hable to receive: to
sharpen and make eagre such as are hungry of ferther knowlage: and to minister
unto the learned or eloque^t teachers, matier sufficient whereon to ground much
profou^d and the same right Christian doctrine. Accept it willingly and render
thanks first to God, who of his infinite mercy and grace has in these our
days sent such a number of such good writers (and among them Erasmus as one
of the chief and principal) not only to give clear light, but also to open a
way unto the pure and perfeict knowlage of Gods word: and than to your most
excellent Sovereign good king Edward the sixte, who among the other his most
princely and most Christian acts, does so soon and so effectually begin
first with the promoting of Gods word and glory, being the fountain and ground
of al good success, wealth, and prosperity: and thirdly to Queen Katerine by
whose good means and procurement this present weorke has been by soondry
men's labors turned into our vulgar tongue, whereby the kings Majesty,
(whose principal desire and trauail is to do all things possible, whereby his
most te^drely beloved subjects knowlage may be ferthered, their conscience
slaighed in a sincere doctrine of Christ, with a perfeict framing and
confirming of the same in a good conversation of life,) might by having so
notable a good matier in readiness be the better occasioned to put forth so
fruitful an exposicion of the gospel. For a paraphrase is a plain setting forth
of a text or sentence more at large, with such circumstaunce of more and other
words, as may make the sentence open, clear, plain, and familiar, which
otherwise should perchance seem bare, unfruitful hard, strange ^ough,
obscure, and derke to be understood of any that were either unlearned or but
meanly entered. And what is this, but a kind of exposicio^, yea and that of the
most p^^hthie and effectual sort? How much therefore art thou bound devout
christian reader, (and especially ye priests, and Curates that either have not
ben brought up in study of letters and of divinity, or else have not such
store of books, as may be sufficient for mainteining of your studies) how much
are al ye bound (I say) unto the kings most exellent Majesty and his most
honorable and worthy Counsaillours, who of a special regard and co^sideracion
of the ignorance and defaute of litterature (which has reigned in most part
of ye Clergy of England as well to ye great detriment, harm and decay of
religion in the christian flocks to their spiritual charge committed, as also
to their own intolerable peril and daungier, when at the general day of
accoumpt and audite to be made at the throne of God, it shall be required at
their hands how and what they have taught to the ignorant multitude, for
whose solles (as touching their institucion in the feith and in the laws of
God) they must answer before a rightful judge, whom no man shall be hable to
corrupt, beguile deceive, or escape) have by their most good policy found a
means, how both ye and all the people may with a great deal less time,
study, labor, yea and also charges, then were won^e to be bestowed in playing
at tables, boules, cards, and other unlawful games, have in a few leaves a
whole library of good doctrine, both for the private edifying of every one
particularely, and also for the enstruccion and teaching of each other in
common. Whatsoever ignorant person is desirous of knowlage, and can be
contented to learn: whosoever is not of an heart so indurate but yt he can abide
such good books, as may further Christ's doctrine, whosoever is not of an
extreme malignaunt stomach against the due setting forth of Gods word:
whosoever is not such an enemy to ye glory of God, that he enuieth the benefit
of Christ's blood unto England: whosoever is not either of such blindness that
he cannot see the truth, or of such perverse and froward malice that he will
not, or of such cancard obstinacy that he will against the spirit and against
his conscience wilfully withstand and resist al good things which may induce
men to the knowlage of God: whosoever does not hate the light of ye gospel:
whosoever is in his heart a favorer of the truth, and of the kings Majesty's
most godly procedinges, has no less cause but to enbrace Erasmus, whose
doctrine the most and best part of al Christian Royalmes and universities has
evermore allowed and judged to be consonau^t to the truth, and also is bound
with immortal thanks to pray for the kings most excellent Majesty, for this
his most gracious setting forth and publishing this present weorke to the use
of such as have need thereof. And where the said Erasmus fer otherwise then a
great nu^bre of ye scholastical sort, and other unlettered expositours of these
last blind seasons, has written these his paraphrases in as ornate a style as
he has the most part of his other volumes: is not (as some barbarous
bloundreers have for safeguard and defense of their own poor honesties
alleged) a thing vnseming for books of holy scripture matiers. For divinity
like as it loves no cloking, but loves to be simple and plain, so does it not
refuse eloquence, if the same come without injury or violacion of ye truth.
For who writes more ornately then the Greek divines, Basilius, Gregory
Nazianzene, Theophilactus, Chrysostom? or who in laten more elegauntly than
Lactancius* Hierome, and diverse others? Albeit in this English paraphrase the
translatours have of purpose studied rather to write a plain style, then to use
their elega^cie of speech, partly because there cannot in all points be
expressed in the English tongue the grace that is in the laten, much less (of my
self I speak) the plesauntnesse that is in the style of Erasmus, a man of
most excell^nt learning and exquisite eloquence in this kind (though in deed
not altogether a Ciceronian, but yet feact, pleasant, sweet, elegaunt, and
sensible) and partly because there was a special regard to be had to the rude
and unlettered people, who perchance through default of atteigning to the high
style, should also thereby have been defrauded of the profit and fruict^ of
understanding the sense, which thing that they might do, was the only
purpose why it was first translated, and now by the kings most excellent
Majesty willed to be read. For as for the learned are hable enough to help
themselfes without any translacions at al. Neither are these translacions to be
depraved, because some reader would perhaps otherwise have turned so^e things
then he shall here read it. For no two enterpreters there be, that in
translating out of any one tongue into an other, would agree in all points of
style or enditing, as (best for this purpose) it may appear by the ancient
fathers of the Church, whose allegacions of places of holy Scripture, most
commonly vary in words, and agree not but in sense. And the same interpreter
that would have translated some part hereof better the^ it now is, would in
some other poinctes perchance have done i^ wurse. Therefore every man
ientilly take and interpret an others labors, and bear with his infirmity,
if not in consideracion of his study and trauail, yet at lestewise for respect
of his good zele and godly entente to ferther knowlage. If it come to the
hands of such as can and will without disdeigne or arrogancy take his pen
and emend any thing that his good and vncorrupt judgment shall see mete to be
corrected: I suppose that besides the reward of God, and the public thanks
of his country, he shall also privately deserve and receive immortal thanks of
the translatours, whose desire is to have it well. Neither do I suppose any to
be of such mind that he would disdeigne or be grieved to see his thing bettered,
as in this great weorke some things are in deed here and there other wise
penned, then the first translatours wrote it. For this is a common weorke of
building, to the which are hired many sundry men of occupacion: and in case
some man be making a door, a windoore, or a frame: though an other of the same
occupacion put his hand to the bettering and perfeicting of it, yet is not the
so dooyng any displeasure, nor cause of grutche to the other: but rather a
beautifiyng of his doing* and a cause of rendreing thanks to the party that
of good will and zele without presumpcion, did put his helping hand to a good
purpose. And sembleably in this common weorke of the gospels vineyarde (for
as much as every labourer has his iye directed to the only mark of setting
forth the glory of God, and his most holy word,) no man means any rebuke
or derogacion to his fellow, when he emendeth something that was to be reformed
or altered: but rather seems to crave the like help of the other again in his
own doings, because it is evident that any man can ferther see, and can be a
more indifferent judge in an other man's doings, then he can be in his own.
Giving therefore first laud, praise, and thanks to God for all his gifts,
and than to our most excellent king Edward the sixth for so gracious
accepting, favoring, and mainteining honest and godly studies: leat every man
employ his good talentes that God has given him, to the public use of
serving and prof^ting his country, and to the common edifying each of other in
Jesus Christ our Lord: to whom together with the father and with the holy
ghost, be all honor laud, and glory world without end.

Amen
To the most virtuous Lady Queen Katerine, late wife to the most noble, and
most victorious king, Henry the eight of most famous memory, Nicolas Udal
your most humble servant wishes health, grace, and consolacion in our Lord
Jesus Christ everlasting.
WHere your excellent highness, most gracious Queen Katerine, sen^e the time
of your first calling to the estate and dignity of espousal and marriage with
the most noble prince that ever reigned, King Henry the eight, has never
ceased by all possible means that in you might lie, to mind, to auaun^e, and
to increase the public commodity and benefit of this common weal of
England: I find on every side so great* and the same so worthy matier of
gratulacion, and thanks geuyng unto God, that I cannot tell on whose part
first to commence and begin the same: whether on your own behalf, whom
God of his goodness did for your singular and the same most notable virtues,
without any your expectacion or hope, soodainly put in King Henry's mind to
chose, call, and auaunce to the dignity and estate of a Queen: or on king
Henry's party, whose good hap it was, so aptly to choose such an one as
should afterward be a feithfull and continual coadiutrice unto him, in all
his most devout and godly procedinges concerning the knoweleage of God and
his word to be set forth to the people: or else for Englandes cause, to
whose public benefit and edifying in true religyo^, all these your
vnc^assaunte peynes and trauayles do finally redounde. Leauyng therefore the
prosecucion of so large a mattier as neither my slendre wit can well contryue,
nor my rude pen is hable to wielde: I shall at this present only thank God
in you, and you in God, for causing these Paraphrases of Desiderius Erasmus of
Roterodame upon the new testament to be translated into Engilshe, for the use
and commodity of such people, as with an earnest zeal, and with devout study,
do houngre and thirst the simple and plain knowlage of Gods word: not for
contencious bableing, but for innocent living: not to be curious searchers of
the high mysteries, but to be feithfull executours and doers of Gods
biddinges: not to be troubleous talkers of the Bible, but sincere folowers of
Gods precepts therein contained: not to be vnreuerent reason^rs in holy
scriptue, for vain setting out of the^r peincted sheathe: but to be humble and
lowly weorkers of Gods glory: not to be curyous dysputers in the gospel
for the defense and mayntenaunce of their inordinate lusts and carnal
liberty, but to be vpryghte walkers in holy conuersacyon of life in the rule
of the gospel prescrybed. Which kind of doctrine, forasmuch as no one writer
has labored in all poynctes and behalfes more vncorruptely or more plainly
to ministre unto the simple reader, then this author by a perpetual dyscourse
and continuacion of the text does: your highness undoubtedly in procuring the
same to be turned into English, has not only after a most godly sort
bestowed your charges: but also has in the thingselfe done unto the commen
weal a benefit by so many degrees surmounting and passing any other act of
your great largess and benignity, as the soul is better then the body, as
spiritual edifying is above temporal supportacion, as gostly food and
coumforte excedeth corporal relief or cherishing, and as heavenly treasours
excel all worldely gifts or richesse. And in that your highness for the more
spedy expedicion of your most godly purpose to bring Gods word to the more
light, and to the more clear understanding, distributed this weorke by porcions
to sundry translatours, to thentent it might al at once be finished, ife the
devout English readers any long time defrauded of so fruitful and so profitable
a weorke: ye have therein, most gracious Lady, right well declared both how
much ye tender Gods honor, and also how earnestly ye mind the benefit of
your country. Which your country, what they are not able in fact with
condign thanks to requite, do and ever will, (as they are most bounden)
supply with perpetual commending your highness to God in prayer, wh^che I
think to be the only reward ye look for or desire. As touching the
translacions (because they are of soondry persons dooinges) though there
appear in them some dyuersitie of style and endicting: yet is there in the
whole weorke no contrariety of doctrine. Though every translatour follow his
own vein in turning the Laten into English: yet does none willingly swerue
or dissente from the mind and sense of his autoure. Albeit some go more nere
to the words of the lettre, and some use the liberty of translating at large,
not so precisely binding themselves to the straight interpretacion of every
word and syllable, (so the sense be kept:) yet do they all agree (every one
as his vein serves him) in feithfully rendreing the sense of their book. So
that if any persons there be either of such high conceipte and opinion of
themselves that they can like no man's doings but their own, or else of such
vinentlenesse that they will not well interpret simple men's doings, which
themselves can for the most part sooner find fault withal then emende, or
else of such morositie and way wardnes that their stomakes cannot bear with any
other man's labors, be they never so honestly intended or bestowed: such are
in this behalf rather to be contemned and left to their insolent
dis^eignefulnes, then either to be pacified or answered unto. The parts of
devout readers are, with immortal thanks to receive and take the fruicion of
honest and godly studies: the office of learned men is, without deprauing or
derogacyon of other men's diligence, and without any arrogancy on their own
behalfes, to employ their good talentes to the pu^lique behoufe of their
country, and to the furtheraunce of godly knowleage: the office of every
studious and diligent writer is, to have his iye directed so the oublique
vtiliti^ only, and than to think his upright well doings a sufficient price
and reward of themselves, and so without respect of any worldely reward or
thank, so refer the fruit and success of his labors to God the mocioner,
the author, and the weorker of all goodness. As touching Erasmus and the
doctrine that his books do sow, although I have before this time somewhat
said as well in my preface unto your highness before the paraphrase upon the
ghospel of Luke, as elsewhere: yet can I not omit thus much to say in his
defense, that in case any persons be enemies to Erasmus writing* it proceeds
more of their envy, of their unquietness of mind, and of their hatered against
the light and grace of the ghospel clearly now arisyng and plenteously
spreading it self abroad, then of any fault or just deserte in Erasmus. Whosoever
wincheth and kiketh at the gospel, in deed cannot but spurn at Erasmus, who
has with incomparable study and trauail showed himself a diligent labourer in
Christ's vineyard. And truly whomesoeuer I perceive to be an eagre adversary
to Erasmus writings, I (as my poor judgment leads me) cannot but suppose
the same to be an indurate enemy to the gospel, which Erasmus does according
to the measure and portion of his talente feithfully labor to set forth and
promote. But like as when manne is in a feure, or with any other grievous
infirmity distempered, the better that the drink is, the wurse it ta^teth in
his mouth: so when the heart is corrupt with malice and hatred of Gods truth,
the better that the doctrine is, the more it offends. Sore iyes cannot abide
the bryghtenesse of the sun, nor a corrupt heart the clear verity of Gods
word. Persons indurate are the worse for reading of holy scripture: neither
do they of any thing take more occasion of slaundre and offense of
conscience, then they do of holy scripture, whereby their conscience should
be edified. Some there be of such malicious hardness of heart, that they can
abide neither book, ne teaching, ne reading, ne any thing else, that may help
or emende the ignorant peoples knowledge. And such, because they would let
and stop Gods glory, deprave all good things, and pronounce them to be
naught. But such are in this behalf not to be passed on, ne to be heard.
For as a body corrupted with ill humors or diseases, the more and better that
it is nourished with good meats and drinks, the wurse it is: so a cankarde
stomach and a wieked heart, the more wholesome doctrine that is ministered unto
it, the more it is indurate, the more does it envy the public utility unto
men* and the more does it strive, and wrestle against the verity. Pharao was
never more eagre in persecuting the people of God, the^ when he was by daily
plagues and miracles most of all provoked te convert. The Pharisees never more
furiously, swelled, ensourged, or raged against Christ, then when he alleged
holy scripture unto them, or brought against them the testimony of their own
law which they could not deny. The scripture of God is all good and godly,
yet like as the same to the good spirit is a sure port of tranquillity and
peace, so is it to the wieked conscience a stumbling block, and a stone of
offense. Out of one and the same flower the Be gathers honey, and the spider
sucketh venom: so great diversity of operacion there is in good and civil
natures. And the common fault that malignaunt persons do allege against the
publishing of Gods word in the mother tongue, and against the setting forth
of wholesome and godly exposicions upon the same, is, that such books cause
sedicion against the doctrine, and than lay their fact to the doctrines
charge. This has evermore hitherto ben the practice and conueighaunce not only
of the Romish Pharisaical sort, but also of the ancient enemies of Gods
truth, even from the beginning. Neither have this malicious generacyon ever as
yet used any other way or color to deface the truth, to let the good
proceeding of Gods word, or to sliere and provoke the indygnacyon of Princes
and Magistrates against the publishyng, or against the true preachers and
teachers thereof: but only by allegeyng that it will move sedicion and teach
error: where in deed Gods word is (as ye would say (a perfeicte
touchestone whereby to find out and to try such cancard stomakes, as would
fain rebelle and move sedicion, and would gladly have it so to be. For
otherwise a great wonder it were, and a veraie strange thing, if the word of
God, or this paraphrase, or any other like godly exposicion of the gospel
(which is in sense none other but the doctrine of Christ and of his Apostles)
should corrupt the readers or teach error, or move sedicion. God and his
most holy word is altogether peace, unity, concord, and perfec^e charity.
Gods word teaches none other doctrine but peace humility, subjection, and
so much obedience to the Princes and Magistrates, as the Romish Babylonians
would not by their good wills have to be put in the heads and hertes of the
ignorant people. But this color have the enemies of Gods word evermore
used to suppress the gospel. So did they by all the Martirs, so have they
done by the true preachers, so did the old Jews by the ancient prophets of
God, and so did ye old Pharisees by Christ himself, whose most grievous
crimes were, that he drew all the world after him, that he taught and sowed
erroneous doctrine, that he seduced the people, and that he made himself a
king. And the malicious Jews laid to Paul's charge, that he begoonne to be a
sedicious moouer of rebellion against Ceasar: not that the thing was so in
deed, but because the same was a cockesure way to make al obedient people hate
the gospel, and to provoke the rew^ers and Magistrates to suppress it. But
the lord, who of his merciful goodness has of late sent out the clear
radiaunt sunnebeames of his holy word and verity to shine over all christen
regions, will (I trust) so continue the light of the same, that the simple
flock shall be hable to discern the spirits of men, and lively to know the
ungodly maligners, which by cauiling and deprauyng all good things, do
wrastie and strougle (as much as in them lies) to keep the ignoraunte
multitude in blidnesse. In the mean time all the simple English congregation,
is bound continually to pray for your highness, that have for their use and
behoufe procured the translacion of this present paraphrase upon the gospel
of Matthew, and upon the residue of the new testament, whereby they may with a
more coumfortable and pleasant readyng in their own mother tongue, both
encreace from day to day in ^nowelage, and also continually be edified in
true religion, nouzeled in right opinions, trained in sincere doctrine, and
confirmed to walk in perferct innocence and integrity of a true Christen
life accordyngly.

The preface of Erasmus unto his paraphrase upon the Gospel of the Evangelist
Matthew.
To the most victorious Emperor Charles, the fifth of that name Erasmus of
Roterodame, gretyng.
Being not ignorant, Charles Emperor most victorious, how much godly fear
and reverence also, is of due congruence to be given, partly unto all holy
scriptures, which the holy fathers through the inspiracion of God, have left
unto us, and especially unto that part of scripture, which makes an upright
and faithful relacion of such things as the heavenly father either wrought in
fact, or spoke in words, for the health and salvation of the whole world,
through his soon Jesus: and being ferther privy to mine own vnwurthynes,
where not many years gone, I first attempted to set hand to making a parahrase
upon Paul's Epistles, for the playner understanding of them (which thing to do
came upon me at that time of a sudden pangue, even of mine own mind) I did no
less, then think myself to enterprise a veral bold and presumpteous act, and
an act (as the proverb says) of a right dangerous hazard, in so much
that after I had in one or two or three chapiters, taken a prouf, and assaye
of the work, how well it would do, I was vttirly minded to pulle down my
sails again, and to surcease from the course that I had before appointed to
take, unless a wunderful consent of my friends being men of lernyng, had
perforce constrained me to proceed with that I had begone. Neither could I for
their most earnest desires* be at any rest or quiet, until I had fully ended
and finished all that ever there was of the Epistles Apostolical, whereas I had
not taken in hand to meddle, but only with those epistles which without all
controversy or doubt were written of thapostle Paul. It has not at al times
framed well with me, ne come to good end, when I have been ruled to do things
at the mocions and instaunt pricking forward of friends. But yet in this thing
nevertheless I was not a little proud of my self, that this my bold
auenturyng had come much more happily to pass, then was looked for, as well
for mine own part that was the maker, to whom it purchased least envy and
grutche of men, of all the wurkes that ever I wrote: as also on the behalf of
all such, as are students and suitors to atteigne to the philosophye of the
gospel, who do every man more then other, give me thanks for that by means
of mine industrious labor, they have to the better knowlage of thapostolicall
wisdom, either been moved and stirred up, or else furthered. But wha^ I had
clean dispatched myself of this great charge and task, I looked not that I
should at any time afterward, have any more to do with this kind of
writing, and behold the right reverend father Matthew, Cardinal of Sedune (by
whose advise and instigacion I had before made up all thepistles canonical) at
what time I spoke with him at Brurels, to welcome him into the country,
according to my duty, after his return from the counsel, which had than
been holden at the city of Wourmes, eue^ by and by at the first entering in
talk with me, even like a man that had devised upon it before, begins to
exhort me, that what I had before done upon thapostolicall Epistles, the same I
should also do upon the gospel of Matthew. I on my party anon made mine
excuse by many things, first that it was already an act bold and
ouerbolde, that I had attempted the same upon the writings of thapostles:
secondly that the Apostles in deed were godly men, yet nevertheless men they
were, but the majesty of Christ to be more great, then that it might be lefull
to adventure the doing of such a thing in his words. And though the majesty
of the work did not put of and drive one away, yet the nature of the argument
or matter of the gospels to refuse the thing, and not to suffer one that should
go about to make a Paraphrase: and not only for that there are in the gospel
persons of diverse and sundry sorts, unto whom while the words and talk is
so applied as to every of them for his rate or degree may best accord, it
comes to pass that the writers pen is kept shut within the enclosure of an
excedyng straight grate, because it is debarred from that liberty, which all
other sorts of commentaries do suffer and receive (for a paraphrase also is
to be reputed as a kind of commentary.) Furthermore where as a good portion
of the gospel consists in making report of this and that act doing, and
that of a simple and a plain report without any curiosity, one that should in
this part make a paraphrase shall seem nothing else to do, but at noontyde to
light a candell, as the proverb of the Greeks does call it. Now ferther,
whereas the aunciente doctoures and writers do in expoundyng the allegories,
partly vary, not declaryng it all after one way: and partly so handle
themselves, that to me they seem often times to play and dally with it, nor
might express or bring in the same allegories, but under the persons, either
of Christ, orels of the evangelist, it is euidente and well to be known in
what narow streyghtes I should travail. I let pass and say nothing, that
Christ in such wise spoke certain things, as he would not have the same to
be understood at the time of the speaking of them: of which sort this here
ensuyng is one: Destroy ye this temple, and within three days space I will
buyld it up again. And also of bying a swearde: of the Phariseis leven to be
eschued. And truly in that same his talk, where he foresheweth the distruccion
of the city of Jerusalem and prophecieth of the end of the world, and of
affliccions long after to ensue unto the Apostles, Jesus does so intermedle
and temper his talk, that me seems his will and pleasure was to be dark and
not understood, not only to the Apostles, but also unto us all. There be
also certain places (as I think) almost impossible to be expouned, of which
sort one is, concerning that sin against the holy ghost shall never be
remitted: an other, concerning the day of judgment, reserved to the knowlage
of the father only, and unknown even to the very son self. In these places
and such like, if one write commentaries, he may at his pleasure without
danger report the sundry opinions of sundry expositours, he has liberty
frankly to confess and acknowledge that he does not understand the mening of
the place. But one that makes a paraphrase has not ye like liberty nor
power. Moreover certain things there be in such sort spoken, that they
touch and concern even these verai times that now are, in which our times
right many things there be, far disagreyng from the institucions and
ordinances of the Apostles. And such things although the Evangelists
foreknew them by ye spirit of prophecy, yet certes under the persons and
names of the Apostles, they can not be reported, but both coldely and also
cuttedly: There was yet also an other point that moved my mind, which was,
that in case I should take and bestow this labor upon Matthew only, there would
by and by be some that would make instaunte and earnest request for to have the
like done upon all the residue of the Evangelists: whose will and desire if I
should follow, than must it cum to pass, yt I must many times more then once
make repeticion of one manier mattiers, that is to were, of all and every
matter in which the Evangelists did among themselves accord. Or, if on the
othersyde I should tie and link together a certain continual process of
tellyng the things, and so to make but one whole tale of them all together:
than (forasmuch as to declare and to open all the places which in the
Evangelists seem to disagre, is nothing else but to be coumbreously entangled
as it were in a certain mase) could I never have been hable to do that is to be
done, for the clerenesse and light that a Paraphrase ought to have. When with
these and verai many mo arguments and reasons, I desired to be rid of the
charge that was laid unto me to go in hand withal, whereas I thought my self
to have a good cause, and an excuse that might have prevailed: yet did the
said Matthewe vanquish me by his eloquence, he got the over hand of me by
reason of his authority whereby he might command me, taking on himself the
daungier and hasard of all the whole matier. Neither durst I be so bold as
any longer to strive or strougle against the advice and council of him, whose
counsels your Majesty customablie uses in most high and weighty affairs,
not vnwyllyngly to follow. And yet where as I had not even plainly taken the
matier upon me, but had only promised that I would one day assay if happily
the thing would frame and go forward: he than iourneiyng toward Millayn, had
made assured warantise unto ye Germans in my behalf, that the work should
this instant winter season cum forth: Whereupon I cummyng back my self again
unto Basile, was in such wise on each side continually called upon of my
masters the Germans, being crauers not of the lest importune sort, that
because I would in any wise discharge both his promise, and mine own honesty
to, I finished up the weorke with little more then a months labor. And God he
grant that both the commandment of him and the obedience of me, may be to
all persons luckie and fortunate, and I trust it will so be if your majesty
will favorably acknowlage and accept this slender gift and present, to the
same dedicated. But here perchance some man that knows you by none other
title saving only by the name of Emperor, will say: What is a book of such
an argument or matier as this for a prince secular, which it had been more
mete and convenient to have dedicated unto abbottes or bishops? for answer
whereof, first me thinks it a thing aptlye given, whatsoever thing being
honest, is put up to a Christen prince. And besides this, where as no prince is
so secular, but that he has a do with the profession of the gospel, the
Emperors are anointed and sacred for this very purpose, that they may either
maynteyne or restore, or else enlarge and sprede abroad the religion of the
gospel. Ergo than (will some man say) the Emperor is not a teacher of the
gospel, but the defendour of it. I grant that: but in the meanwhyle mete it
is, not to be ignorant what manner thing it is, for which one takes armor to
defend it. And forsooth wha^ I consider that heart and mind of yours in such
wise to be given unto religion and to godly devotion, that to Bishops and
Abbottes it may toward the study of godliness, be as well a rule, as also a
spur, me seems, I can not dedicate this gift unto any man, more
conuenientlye, then to your majesty. So that the thing which I might aptly
have dedicated to any Christen prince, and more aptlye to a Christen Emperor:
I do most aptly of all dedicate unto you Charles. Much less apt things
do they bring unto you, that give you great gifts of precious stones, that
are gayson to be found, of lusty fierce horses, of hounds, and of rich
hanginges, that come out of far strange countries. And moreover forasmuch
as the Evangelists have written the gospel unto all folks, no person
excepted: I do not see why it should not of every man be read. And I have so
handled it, that it may be understood, even of such also, as are
unlettered. And surely it shall with excellent good fruit be read, if every
body shall take it in his hands of the only mind and intent, to be made
thereby a better man then he was before: and not apply scripture of the gospel
to his own affeccions, but contrarywyse refourme and correct his life and his
desires, according to the rule and prescripcion thereof. I have in this present
work chiefly followed Origenes, being singularly above others expert in
divinity, and Chrysostom and Hierome, of the catholic writers most best
allowed. That Lord and Prince of heaven give and grant unto you Charles,
Emperor most imperial, such things to mind and to go about, as are of the
principal best sort, and the same lord well prosper your endeavors in that
behalf, to the end that the most noble Empier, which ye have hitherto had
without bloodshed of man, ye may semblably as well enlarge and amplify, as
defend and maintain. And this poinct in the mean while it may please your
merciful graciousnes from time to time to have in your remembrance, that no
war there is upon so just and lawful causes taken in hand, nor with so good
moderacion executed, that draws not after it an huige heap both of
abominacions, and also of miseries: yea, and remember also the greatest portion
of all the harms, to light in fine, upon persons both giltles and also
unworthy the same.

Yeuen at Basile on the Ides of January, in the year of our Lord a thousand,

The life of saint Matthew written by Hierome one of the ancient doctors of
the Church.
MAtthew which was other wise also called Leui, being of a Puplican made an
Apostle, first of all others composed and wrote in Iewrye, the gospel of
Christ in the Hebrew tongue, for their behoufe and cause, which being of the
circumcision had believed: which gospel what person did afterward translate
into Greek, it is not verai certainly known. But truly the very Hebrew self
is had even until this present day in the librarye of Lesarea, which
librarye Pamphilus the martyr did with all possible studiousnes set up and
make: And I my self also had the same gospel of Matthew in Hebrew, lent me
to copye it out, of the Nazarites, which in Beroea a city of Syria, do use
the same book. Wherein is to be noted and observed, that whersoeuer this
Euangeliste, either in his own person, orels in the person of our savior,
doethe use any allegacions of the old Testamente, he does not follow the
auctorite of Septuaginta, that is to say, of the three score and ten
translatours: but of the Hebrew. Of which sort are set these two citacions
here ensuyng. Out of Egypt have I called my soonne: and For a Nazarite shall he
be called.

The Paraphrase of Erasmus upon the Gospel of saint Matthew.
The first Chapter.
IF men so gredely embrace a book, which is set forth by the industry of
man, concerning the preseruacion or restoryng of health, or the way to
increace worldely substance, or touching any other faculty which makes only
for worldly commodities, with how much more fervent love and desyer ought
this book to be received of all men? whose profyt and commodity belongs
indifferently to all men. This book promises not worldly commodities, which
last but a while: but it teaches all heavenly wisdom, delivered unto
mankind from the heavenly doctor Christ Jesus: And it promises al^o a
wonderful reward, not riches, nor kingdom, nor pleasures, but true and
everlasting felicity: unto the which felicity this book shows the most
ready and easy way for all men. It shewethe also the author and mean, through
whom every man has health and salvation, and without whom no man may hope
for health and salvation. What man would not be moved and provoked with a
sure hope of such a good thing, be he never so barbarous or unlettered? And
this wundrefull salvation (which neither man's endeavor, nor the paynfull
labor of the Philosophers, nor the supersticious religion of the Gentiles, nor
the diligent obseruacion of Moses law, could fully perform or give) God
the maker, the preserver, the ruler, and restorer of all things visible and
invisible, did show and declare in times paste, by the sayings of all his
Prophets, being replenished with his heavenly spirit, unto all the world,
but most specially to the people of the Jews (which at that time were a
figure of Christ's church, which shortly after should be enlarged throughout
all the world) signifiyng and showing before by diverse dark figures and
shadows, whatsoever he has now plainly made open unto the world, by his son
Jesus Christ, who was the messinger of this free felicity, being ambassador
in earth of God his father, in such wise, that he was also the teacher of the
wholesome philosophy, he was ye example, he was both the pledge, the promiser,
and the author of the everlasting reward. For God by his secret counsel
which man's wit is utterly unable to search out, has suffered mankind,
being of disposicion like his first parent, and pro^e to all vice, to be
entangled with false religions, with sundry vices of life, and naughty
desires, to the intent that in this time of al times most to be desired and
wished for, the which Gods wisdom the orderer of all things had appointed
to it self, al men should with the more desirous and agreeable minds enbrace
this philosophy, being both very wholesome and of marvelous efficacy, after
that they have once perceived, that neither by those commodities and healpes
which the world promyseth here to be chyefe, nor by so many fine and
exquisite precepts of the philosophers, nor by so many sorts of religions,
nor by the scrupulous obseruacion of Moses law, they could actayne unto true
godlynes and true felicite: Nay rather the more earnestly they labored to cum
unto innocence and felicity, as long as they trusted to man's help and
strength, the more they were entangled with vice and filthy desires. Therefore if
the Jews, whom it behooved chiefly to accept and embrace the thing that is
offered unto them, being so often promised, and so long looked for, if they
alone neglect so great godnes, which is freely offered to all men, and if they
had rather alone to lack it, than to have it common with others, they can impute
their destruction to nothing but to their own incredulity and unbelief. The
sayings and prophecies of the holy Prophets, prophesied these things
chiefly for them. They saw Christ with their iyes workyng miracles, they
heard with their ears the doctrine of the gospel. The kingdom of heaven was
preached first to them. But truly whosoever are wearye of their former life,
as many as love true innocence and godly living, whosoever desires true,
perfect, and everlasting felicity, let them receive this gospel, this
pleasant and merry tydinges, with merry and cherefull hertes, whether they be
Greeks, or Jews, or Romans, or Scithians, or Gallians, or Britans. Like as
God is not only God of the Jews, but indifferently God over all, and common to
all, like as there is one sun which is common to the whole world: so Jesus
Christ the son of God came to save all men, dyed for all, arose again for
all, ascended into heaven for all, and sent his holy spirit to all, refusyng
none, neither for diversity of stock, or of age, or of kind, or of state, or
of life. All the sins of the former life be drowned once by his death in holy
baptism. And those sins be not imputed, be they never so grievous, for the
cleansyng of which, that blessed innocent once dyed: so that the rest of the
life be passed over after the rule of Christ, that is to say, after the
doctrine of the gospel: from the time of baptism, a man is judged or taken
to be a christian, to the perfourmaunce of the which so high a profession, he
will grant his fre succor and aid, and will grant also plentiful reward
to them that do persevere unto the end. He requires of no man the burden of
Moses law, only he requires lively faith, the which may redily believe
whatsoever is showed, and with a sure trust look for that which is promised.
The eternal verity doethe not deceive: God the promiser disapointeth not.
Further, man's law shall not now prescribe what is to be done, but Christian
charity shall plainly tell.

And hitherto we have truly delivered unto you the gospel by mouth, and
have made all men partetakers of those things which we have seen with our
iyes, and heard with our ears. Now because there is danger, this thing
being spread abroad daily more and more, lest the tellyng of it, passing by
many men's mouths, may varye, or else lest the tale told by mouth, be
not so well believed as when it is written in a book, and furthermore to
the intent that the thing that is written may the more easily cum unto all men,
than the voice of the mouth: we shall comprise in this book, the sum of the
whole matter, so much as shall be sufficient to the obteynynge of salvation,
as the natiuite, the doctrine, the miracles, the death, and the resurreccion.
And first of all we shall recite the geneologie and pe^igree of Jesus Christ,
taking our beginning not from the high head, but from David and Abraham,
either for because the memory of these two is very ryfe and common, and
very acceptable among the Jews, for their glory is chiefly of Ahraham, as of
the autour and beginner of their nation, and David the king being so much
praised by the commendacion of God, styeketh the more in their minds, because
the memory of him is yet but fresh and new: or else because Christ which
was looked for so many years, was promised chyefly unto these two, and that
in the books and oracles of the Hebrews, to whom even those that be directly
against Christ, gave great credyt. For in the book of Genesis God speakethe
unto Abraham, promysyng that in time to come, there should spring one out of
his stock, through whose free benefit, not only the nation of the Jews, but
also all the people of the whole world being received into the right, and
title, and love of children, should obtain with Christ, the felowshyppe of
the kingdom of heaven, not by circumcision, which was not as than setforth,
but by ye faith of the gospel. For thus says God unto Abraham: In thy seed,
that is to say, in Jesus Christ all nations shall be blessed. Further David
in the mystical psalms speaks thus: Of the fruit of thy womb shall I set
upon thy seat. And this shall we do, chiefly because of the Jews, lest they
being a rebellious nation, and hard of belief (knowing by the authority of
prophecies which they sufficiently believe, that Messiah which should come,
was promised) may make cauillacions, and say that there is an other savior
to be looked for, and that this is not he, whom the scriptures promised. For
many of them because their minds be blinded with desires of worldly things,
not taking aryght the sayings of the Prophets, (such was their carnal and
gross affeccion) looked for some mighty and glorious king, who being valiant
with arms or hosts, weapon, riches, and such other defenses of this world,
should promote his people to riches, honor and emperie, and should subdue
the whole world to the dominion of the Hebrews. But Christ although he be
lord over all, came not into the world, to the intent to enryche with
worldly gooddes one nation, of the which he was borne as touching his body yt
he took, but to the intent to auaunce all the nations of the whole world unto
true riches, that never should decay: and to make them blessed everlastingly
with heavenly riches, to ouercum the tyranny of death by sufferyng and diyng,
to subdue enemies by gentill deseruinges, to kill the monsters of vice, and the
rebellious prouocacions of concupiscence by the sweard of the spirit, and they
being once ouercum that fight against the spirit of God, to give us of his
own righteousness and innocence: Finally by spiritual weapons to win unto
us a spiritual kingdom. But these Jews cannot have hereafter anything to
say, when they shall see all things to consent and agree unto him, whom we
know to be come, and constauntly preach the same: which things the holy
prophets inspired with the heavenly spirit, had prophesied with a full
consent and agremente, so long before in holy books, that is to say, the
stock, the family, the manner of birth, the life, the doctrine, the
miracles, the affliccions, the rebukes, the kind of death, the burial, the
resurreccion, thascendyng into heaven, the holy ghost sent down from heaven,
the wounderfull toungues of the Apostles, the conversion of the Gentiles, and
other things which we saw and daily see done by them that profess the name
of Christ. Finally the time also does agree, in ye which he was prophesied
for to come. And all these things were prophesied, not only by the sayings of
the Prophets, but also were signified by the acts and deeds of ye Patriarchs.
Now seeing they know these things, if they compare the^ with these which we
show to have been done, they shall understand that they look in vain for any
other Messiah, th^n this whom we speak of, he came once humble and abiccte
concerning the form of man's body (for so Esai prophesied he should come)
to deliver all men by his death from the tyranny of death. And he shall cum
again in the end of the world, not as now, a savior, but a judge of all,
both living and dead. Now no man is excluded from his benefit. Than no man
shall escape his judgment. But than shall they joyfully see ye judge dealyng
everlasting rewards, which now do not despise him a meke savior and easy to
be entr^ted. This therefore is that only and very Messiah, whose geneologie and
petigre shall forthwith be showed, touching the body which he took for our
cause: for by him should spring and cum forth a new nation not carnal but
spiritual, which should rather replenish heaven than earth, the which also
should be encreaced or multiplied, not by the seed of man, but by the
euangelical faith, which is the heavenly seed of Gods word. Of this faith
the autour and father in a mystical figure was represented by Abraham, who
(the law of circumsicion not yet publyshed,) deserved the praise of
righteousness, not before men, but before God, not by the keeping of the law, but
by the sincerity of faith, whereby he doubted nothing of Gods promises,
although they were far passing the power of nature. And for this trust and
confidence, he was called the father of many nations, which after the example
of him should believe the gospel of Jesus Christ. He now, his body being
decayed for age, his wife also being weak and barain, begat Isaac which was
promised unto him, who also was a figure of Christ, vearyng wood to the
sacrifice, whereunto he was appointed. Isaac begat Jacob, which though he were
the younger brother, yet he set his elder brother beside, and purchased the
inheritance to himself, wherein he was a figure of the church that should be
congregated and gathered together of the Gentiles, the which, the Jews being
excluded, increases daily more and more, receiving the grace of the gospel by
faith, of the which the Jews through unbelief have made themselfes unworthy.
For thus says God: I have loved Jacob and hated Esau. And in the Prophets
often mention is made of this name. Jacob begat Judas, of whom the tribe had
his name, of the which Christ was prophesied to cum of, and by whose name, as
by inheritance, was promised the new law of the gospel, for thus speaks
Hieremie: Behold the days do come, says the Lord, and I will dispose a
new testament to the house of Judas and the house of Jacob. And he did not
beget him only, albeit he deserved chiefly to be recited in ye geneologie, but
also he begat the other eleven brothers of Judas, which severally gave names
to ye several trybes of the nation of Israel.

Further Judas had two children at a burden: named Phares and zaram, not of his
lawful wife, but of Thamat his daughter in law, which was married to Her, the
eldest soonne of Judas, unto whom when Judas did not perform his promise,
that is to say, that she might be married to Sela, brother unto her housbande
that was dead, according to the order of the law, the woman passing all measure
desirous to have a child, took the habit of a common woman, and coueryng her
face by craft and deceyte, lay with Judas her father in law, and afterward
by showing of the token which she had received of him before that she would
suffer him to lie with her, avouched and proved him to be father of both the
children, when he otherwise earnestlye would have burnt her according to the
law. The thing thus done is not without offense and blame, but yet the
mystery hyd under this dishonest couerture makes much for the matter of the
Gospel. Like as also Phares was a figure and significacion of the church and
Synagogue, which Phares prevented his brother when he endeavored to go furthe
of his mothers womb, puttyng forth his hand first.

Of this Phares Esrom was borne, of Esrom Aram, of Aram Aminadab, of Aminadab
Naasson, and of him Salmon. Salmon begat Boos of Rahab, which though she were
not of the nation of Jews, but of the Cananites, yet because she preserved the
spyalles sent from Jesus the captain and guide of the Jews, and because she
betrayed the city of Hierico, she deserved her place in the geneologie of
them, which through faith were made praise worthy of God, and she exempted
out of the sort and order of common women, was chosen and admitted among the
people of God, and married to an housbande of the nation of Jews: signifying
even at that time, that sinners and heathen people being alienate from the
religion of God, should be coupled unto Christ through the merit of faith.
Boos also hade a soonne named Obeth, by Ruth a Moabite, the which also
renouncyng her countreye, and her bodily affeccions, had rather to be planted
among the people of the Jews, that is to say, such as profess the doctrine
of Christ. Thus at that time fygures and shadows signified before, that no
kind of men should be driven and kept of from the fellowship of the gospel,
so that he bring with him faith and a desirous mind of true godlynes. Of Obed
came Iesse, which was called also Isai, of whose name Esaias propheciyng of
Christ, makes mention saying: A rod shall cum out of the root of Iesse. Of
him was borne David derely beloved of God, both king and Prophet, buylder of
the city of Jerusalem, noble, through the slaughter of Goliad: and after that
the wicked king Saul was deposed by the commandment of God, from a pore
shepeherd he was consecrate king over the Israelites. Out of whose stock the
whole nation of the Hebrews did look that Christ should cum, as it was
prophesied before of men that were inspired with God. And he also did represente
by many ways the figure of Christ, his offspring. David begat Solomon that
king of peace, and the buylder of the Lords temple: and he begat him of
Bethsabee whom he loved: whom he coupled unto him in marriage, after that
Urias her former housbande was stayne by his fraud and gyle: and that was done
not without great sin if a man consydre nothing besides the outward part of
the history: but again not without significacion of things to cum, if a man
search the mystery.

Solomon begat Roboham, Roboham begat Abia, Abia begat Asa, Asa begat Iosaphat,
Iosaphat begat Ioram, Ioram begat Ozias, Ozias begat Ioatham, Ioatham begat
Achas, Achas begat Ezechias, Ezechias begat Manasses, Manasses begat Amon, Amon
begat Iozias, Iozias begat Iechonias and his brethren about the time of the
captivity of Babylon. And after the captivity of Babylon, Iechonias begat
Salathiel, Salathiel begat Zorobabel, Zorobabel begat Abiud, Abiud begat
Eliachi^, Eliachim begat Azor, Azor begat Sadoc, Sadoc begat Achin, Achin begat
Eliud, Eliud begat Eleazar, Eleazar begat Matthan, Matthan begat Jacob, Jacob
begat Joseph the husband of Marie, of whom was borne that Jesus which is
called Christ. Of Solomon was borne Roboham: and of Roboha^ Abias: of Abias
came Asa: of Asa Iosaphat, from whence came Ioram, and of him Ozias: of Ozias
was borne Ioatham: of Ioatham Achas: of Achas Ezechias, and of him Manasses: of
Manasses was born Amon: of Amon Iozias: of Iozias, Iechonias and the other
brothers of Iechonias, about the time when king Nabugodonozor burned the temple
of Jerusalem, and carried the king and the people of the Hebrews, captive into
Babylon, which were figures, signifiyng the tyranny of the devil toward
mankind, and against liberty restored thoroughe the benefit of Christ. In
this nere and narowe point between seru^tude and liberty when the people of
God were about to be restored to their religion and dwelling places, Iechonias
begat Salathiel: Salathiel zorobabel: zorobabel Abiud: of Abiud came Eliachim:
of Eliachim Azor: of Azor Sadoc: of him Achim: of Achim Eliud: of Eliud
Eleazar: of Eleazar Matthan: of Mattha^ Jacob. And this Jacob was the father of
Joseph, unto whom was married Mary the mother of Jesus, who was promised to be
the savior of all men, whom the Hebrews call Messiah, that is to say Christ,
or anointed: because he only being king over all, and high priest, with ye
sacrifice of his own body, has pacified God the father being displeased and
grieved with the sins of mankind. And the tyranny of death utterly put
away, he has opened the kingdom of heaven unto all men. The clean was
married to the clean, the most chaste to the chaste, of the same trybe and
family, that is of David, according to the order of Gods law, lest any man
should think that this order and geneologie of kindred were of little profit
concerning the declaracion of Christ's stock, whereof he came as touching his
humanity.

And if any man list to harken the time that Daniel described many years past
by certain orders and degres of weeks, he shall find the sayings of ye
Prophets very agreeable to ye thing that is now cu^ to pass. The su^me of ye
wholle geneologie rests in three fowertenes. For if ye count from Abraham ye
patriarche unto David ye author of ye storishing kingdom, ye shall find,
xiiii generacions. Again if ye count from David, unto the decay of the
kyngedome, yt is unto the exile into Babylon, ye shall find.xiiii. generacions.
Again if ye count from ye time unto Christ, the beginner and the finisher of
the new evangelical generation and new kingdom: ye shall find fowertene
generatio^s. Hitherto we have showed you truly ye geneologie of Christ, to ye
intent it may appear to al men, yt this is he, who^ ye true sayi^ges of ye
Prophetesi^ times paste promissed to ye world. And so many arguments agree in
one, that it cannot seem to be done by chance, and that withal it may be
evident, that he was very man which came as touching the flesh of such
auncestoures as were notably known.

But, although he were man borne of man, which came to redeem mankind by his
death: yet he was not borne after the common and vulgar sort of them that be
borne. For it was seemly, that he which came from heaven, which called unto
heaven, which taught a promised nothing but heavenly things, finallye
which after so many Prophets and doctors was made ambassador, to the intent
that once and for altogether he should make al things new, and cum forth into
the world with a very body in deed, but yet after a new manner, and that the
true nativity of man should be declared in such ^orte, that it should not
be thought unseemly for God: and Esaie prophesied this thing to cum to pass,
that because men did in manner sleep at these common miracles of nature, by
reason of custom, God should show a new miracle and that in the yearthe, to
the intent it should be more evident to all men's sight and understanding. He
is borne very man and mortal, and yet the same very God and immortal. He is
borne a man of man and yet of a virgin. He is borne of the stock of Ada^
which was the first of mankind, and yet without the spot of sin. He is
borne in matrimonye, but so, that the work of his concepcion was not of man,
but of the holy ghost: who by a wonderful mean, fourmed and fashyoned the
strange and maruailous fruit, of ye substance of the undefiled virgin, as in
an heavenly temple consecrated to God. And he ordered this matter with such a
maruailous wisdom, that he covered and hyd it from the wicked, as a thing
incredible: and persuaded it unto godly minds with most certain and sure
arguments, the which no eloquence of man was utterly able to prove and
persuade. Wherefore when the holy virgin eternally appointed to this great
mystery, to be the mother of Jesus, by the advice of her parents, whose
hearts were ordered and directed by the power of God, being spoused to an
honest man of her tribe, named Joseph, kept company with him in house, she was
found great with child before they came and coupled together as manne and
wife, either because true honesty, is not hasty to the lust of pleasure, or
because God did so order this matter. For the maidens womb waxyng daily
greater and greater, declared it unto Joseph to be so, being her housbande,
which both loved her well, and was not insencible in such things. And the
fled not from the sight of her housbande, as though she had in her
conscience yielded her self culpable, neither disclosed she the secret, which
she had learned of the Angel: eyether because she was in despair, ye the thing
might as yet be believed or persuaded, or because she reserved this unto god to
be declared in time convenient. Therefore the co^cepcion was certain and true
declaryng it self by manifest and accustomed tokens, especially unto Joseph,
who by reason of conversation in householde, marked, more easily in his spouse,
the habyte and form of her body. But this young thing came not furthe by the
embracing of man, as other women by the common law of nature be wont to
conceive, but by the holy ghost: which by the angel Gabriell than messinger
from heaven, enteryng into the most holy temple of the virgins womb (the
invisible power of the fatherlye god head imbracyng and owershadoynge the whole
body and mind of the most holy virgin) without any hurt or detriment of
chastity, made her great with child.

But Joseph her husband being a righteous man, would not put her to shame, but
was minded to depart from her secretly. Furthermore Joseph being yet
ignorant of so great a mystery, wha^ he saw evident arguments and tokens of
concepcion in his wife, and knew well that he had never to do with ye maid,
whereby she might becum great with child, and yet had found the manners of her
to be such, that there could be no suspicion of aduoutry in her, and besides
that true honesty is neither ready to misdeme, nor hasty to revenge: he began
to cast in his mind, by what means he might both see for the good name, and
the life of his wife: and also commit the matier unto god, whereof he himself
could find no end nor issue. By the reason of great familiarity, he found
the manners of the maid utterly without blame. For that godly spirit, which
dwelled wholly in her heart, did appear in her iyes, and in her countenance,
and did declare it self every where in her going, in her gesture, and in her
communicacion. He had espied in her a certain heavenly thing and above the
common rate of other mortal creatures. And yet he saw her great with child,
and she was away from home certain months, while she went to see her cosyn
Elizabeth. Furthermore he considered how great the weakness of that age and
kind was in other maidens. What business would sum other husband have made
here, chiefly if love had styred up gelowsy which is a very sore disease of
the mind? But to prove this matter to be true. Joseph was chosen out to be a
witness, lest any man might say, the child of Marye was either another
woman's, or else unlawfully gotten. He was a man well esteemed of all men, a man of known and tried honesty and wisdom, so that no man might suspect
him, either to be so notably naughtye that he would be his wives bawd, or of
so foolish patience, that he would nourysh and bring up with the child her whom
he knew to be an aduoutresse. There be none more cruel against their wives
that do amiss, than they which be defiled with many aduoutryes themselves.
Joseph himself being very innocent, was so far from al desire of vengeance
that he did not so much as once in words find fault with her, lest he
should discourage the virgins heart with any sorowfulnes. He is troubled with
himself with secret cares of the mind, and does devise a gentle kind of
divorce, that he might be delivered from her company which was with child, in
such wise, that she might bear no blame, nor be in any ieopardie or peril.

And thus far God has suffered this innocent man to be troubled and
distracte with doubtefull devises. For this was expediente for the certentie of
his faith. But now it was time for him to be delivered out of these griefs of
his mind, being worthy doubtless to be made partaker of this mystery, for the
great honor that he did to the virgyn thus consecrated to God. And for the
approved gravity and sobrenesse in suppressyng the cares of his mind, he was
thought mere to conteyne and keep trustely this secret mystery, which was not
yet to be published, because of the perverse and froward suspicion of the
Jews. Behold the angel Gabriel, (which signified unto the virgin the
maruelouse concepcion, apperyng with great light unto her waking, because of
her pureness which was more than angelical, being well acquaynted with such
kind of visions,) presents himself unto Joseph in his sleep: and as he was
musing in his sleep of such like matter, the messinger of the heavenly
oracle, spoke unto him in this wise: Joseph the son of David, what carnal
suspicion troubles thy mind? why art thou vexed? why do thou waver in and
out? or why do thou muse upon diuorcement? or why will thou be dimissed from
her, which is cowpled unto the with so great love, and also by the kindred both
of tribe and family? There is none other spouse worthy for that virgin, and
she is appointed to none other by the ordinance of God, bu^ to the. Thou must
know, that David is the author of thy stock, unto whom was promised in times
past the thing that now begins to be performed. All that is done, is
godly. Thou nedest not to fear that thy wives womb rising without thy doing
shall steyne thy matrimony with any spot of dishonestie. Thou do suppose that
she is great with child, and do suppose aright. But thou must not therefore
remove her from thy company and conversation, but rather take her and adioyne
her unto the, because thou see her great, unto whom by gods ordinance thou
art given to be an husband, to the intent that hereafter thou may be a
witness of the frui^tfull virginity found in thy wife, and that she in the
mean time by that that she is married unto the, may be in safety against the
suspiciouse cruelty of the Jews, unto whom this mystery is not yet to be
opened, especially unto them that be not yet worthy, neither of capacity to
receive it. This matter shall be communicated and opened unto the, to the intent
thy wives innocence shall suffer none unworthy thing. For this new fruit,
wherewith thou see thy wives womb daily to encreace, like as it is not of
the, so it is of none other mortal man. The Angel brought the message being as
a goer between God and her, in making this godly coniunccion, the father has
ouershadowed her: the holy ghost has prepared her womb, the son of god
has replenished it. All is new for that a new child shall be borne. It
proceeds from heaven that thy wife shall bring forth, who shall be more chaste
also after that she has brought forth child. And she shall bear a son: not
for the, but for the world. In the mean season, thou shall be called his
father, and thou shall be the keeper of the maid, rather than the housbande.
When the child is borne, thou as the father shall give it a name, not a name
after thine own fantasy, but that name that God, agreably unto the thing, did
destinate and appoint unto him, before the creacion of the world. And thou
shalt call his name Jesus, that is to say, savior, for this is that same
Messiah desired and looked for so many years, who according to the sayings of
the Prophets, shall deliver all his people from their sins: not by the
sacrifice of beasts, but through^ his own blood. And he will not only be
content to give freely this so great a benefyt, but when we are purged from the
sins of our former life, he will give us also very perfect, and eternal
salvation.

And surely none of all this matter is brought to pass by chance or fortune,
but by the decree and providence of god. For the thing that we show to be
done, the same in times past the lord himself promised that he would do it,
speaking by the mouth of his prophet Esaias, and setting forth in few words
both the strange, newnes and ye great fruit and profit, of this concepcion.
Behold, says he, a virgin shall conceive and bring furthe. And this is the
straungenes of it: for when was it ever heard, a maiden to have borne a child
without blemish of her virginity? Now harken what is the fruit and profit:
And his name shall be called (says he) Emanuel, which sounds in Hebrew, God
with us. For this only one shall reconcile his prople unto god, and where as he
was offended and displeased, he shall make him favorable and merciful, and
being conuersaunt among men, he shall power the most abundant goodness of god
in them, and at last they having knowledge and experience of his effectual
doctrine, of the might of his miracles, of his present efficacy and strength,
and of the vehemency of his divine spirit, showyng it self after a new sort
in them that shall believe, they shall cry and not without a cause: God is with
us. If thou acknowledge the prophecy (as truly thou do acknowledge) give
attendaunce and honor to this mystery, and keep close this secret priuitie.

When the messinger of the high God had spoken these things, Joseph waking
from sleep both merely and cherefully, did obey the oracle. He sets aparte
al his purpose of discord, and takes his wife more nerely unto him, yt no man
might suspecte any discord or disagrement to be between the^. And now he
perceiving yt she was wholly dedicated unto god of heaven, does honor in her
the godly mystery, nor dares not touch her, whom god had taken only to
himself. He is diligent in service, but he forbeareth to company with her as
her husband. In the mean reason that heaue^lye fruit waxes ripe in the holy
woumbe of the virgin, which cummyng furthe at his time of his mother the
virgin, took not away the integrity of his parente, but did consecrate and
sanctifye the same. Further Joseph (as he was commanded of the angel) bearing
the countenance of a father hitherto, gave a name to the child, Jesus, when
after the fashion of the country, he was circumcised the ^yght day.

The.ii. Chapter.

HItherto ye see how many things do accord and agree with the godly sayings
of the prophets. He is borne of the same auncetours and of the same tribe and
family, that the prophecy promised he should be borne. Also the supputacion
and count of the wekes, when Daniel prophesied that he should cum, does
consent and agree. When Jesus was borne. etc.
Also the strange Nativity does agree, in that that he was borne of a virgin
without help of man. And the name does agree. A Savior was promised, a
Savior was looked for, and Jesus signifies a Savior. Furthermore the name of
the country, and of the town, does answer to the faith of the Prophets, for
he was borne not far from Jerusalem in a little town called Bethleem, and
that in the country of Iewry, (for there is a town in Galile also of this
name, in the tribe of zabulon,) and he was borne in the time when Herod an
Idumean by birthe and not a Jew, obtained the Kingdom over the Jews, that no
man neded for to doubt but that now was the time that Messiah should be borne,
the which Jacob the Patriarche many years before prophesied should cum to
pass, saying: The scepter shall not be taken from Judah, nor a ruler from his
thighe, till that he cum which should be sent. Truly this is he, the holiest
of all, at whose entering all the anointing of the Jews ought to have ceased,
and give place. Now ye shall understand by what wonderful means he began by
little and little to be know to the world. For he would be manifest and open
unto all, which came to save all, that both he might be known unto good men
to their salvation, and that he might take away from the wicked all excuse of
ignorance. He was promised chiefly to the Jews, he was borne of them, he was
first preached unto the^ of the Angels, syngyng glory on high unto God, and in
the earth peace among men of good will. The shepherdes being taught by the
voice of the same Angels, and told of the child yt was borne, offered the
first fruits of faith at the maunger where the babe was borne. By the secret
inspiracion of the spirit he was known of Elizabeth, of Simeon and Ann^ the
prophetisse. First of all he showed himself unto poor and humble persons,
whom he knew to be most pres^^ and ready to receive faith. For the proud would
not lightly receive him being humble, nor the rich, him being poor, nor the
stout him being meke: nor they that were entangled with the desires of this
world, would receive him that was heavenly. And because he was promised not
to the Jews only, but also to the Gentiles, yea to all the nations of the
world, he would even at the very entery of his beginning, be known of them
also, to thin^ent he might declare and show, that salvation was also offered
unto them, and that he might stir and provoke the Jews by their example, to
cum to faith and to believe.

And he did not draw all men by one mean to the knowledge of himself, but he
allured every mane by little and little by such things as they already knew
and were well acquainted with. The Jews gave faith unto the Prophets, they
were moved with signs and woonders, therefore he entised the^ by the
allurement of these things. Behold there came etc.
The Persians and the Caldeans did attribute much to the stars, as men
much given to this kind of Philosophy, through the knowledge whereof they
had persuaded themselves, that there should be a certain wonderful restorer
of the world. Therefore they had knowledge of the birthe of the child, not by
any Prophet or Angel, but by a certain strange and a wonderful apperyng
of a star, truly of that star, the which the prophecy of Balaam did
show before to rise out of the house of Jacob. And now they had knowledge by
the common fame that this king was chiefly promised unto the nation of the
Jews, and that he was not a mean king, and of the common sort, but very
notable, and without comparison: of whose power, of whose wisdom and of whose
goodness, far excedyng the power, wisdom, and goodness of man, the whole world
should have experience. Further (as the ill man when he has occasion is made
wurse, and a wise man as he has occasion is made wiser,) certain Magians (for
by this name the Persians called them that be notable in the science of
Philosophy) to the intent they might come nere and learn more exactlye the
thing that the star showed unto them as in a dream, being nothing afearde at
the great journey, they come unto Jerusalem, the star guydyng them the way:
either because there dwelled the Scribes and Phariseis which were very expert
in the law and the Prophets, or because they understood that the king should
be borne not far from Jerusalem. For now knowing certainly that he was
borne, only they inquired what place it was yt was made happy with so noble a
birthe. For they thought that the nativity of so great a prince could not be
hid among them, which looked for his birth so many hundred years, especially
seeing he should be borne not only among them, but also of them. But Christ is
no where later or with more difficulty known, than in rich* cities, and in
princes courts, and among them that be arrogant in the profession of wisdom.
For we saw his star in the East. etc
But they, ignorant of these things, inquire simplye and openly. Where is he
(quod they) which is lately borne the king of Jews? For we know by a sure
token that he is borne. For when we were far hence in the East, we saw his
star of a marvelous bryghtnesse and bewty. We saw the star and felt the
inspiracion. Therefore because we know that he is borne to the commodity and
profit of all men, though we be strangers, yet be we come hither to honor
and wurship him, and to give the first fruits of honor due unto the new
king. Knowing well that they shall be happy and blessed, that shall have his
power and might merciful unto them.

What time they had such communicacion simply with all men, by and by the
rumoure and tidings was brought to Herod the King, which a good while had
feared and trembled at the name of him that should be borne, fearyng lest he
should be set beside the kingdom, which he being a stra^^gier than held, if
so great a prince had been borne of the stock of ye Jews. For Herod dreamed
of nothing else, but of an earthly kingdom, little knowing that Christ brought
in another kind of kingdom, which should perteyne universally to all men.
Therefore after that he heard that he was borne, whom he feared to be borne,
and heard it of the Magians, men both of learning, and (as concerning worldly
port) not to be despised, truly he was troubled in his mind, and with him
also the whole city of Jerusalem: diverse men diversely, either fearyng or
hopyng. But the wisdom of God so ordered the affections and endeavors of men,
that both the simplicity of the godly, and also the rage of the ungodly set
forth the glory of Christ on every side, and made the things that were
incredible the more to use believed. And this was the cause that the loode
sterre of the way, left the Magians for a time entering into Jerusalem: that
their inquiry might show abroad the fame of the child that was borne, and
yet the place where the child was borne, should be kept secret from the cruel
king. And they said to him: At we^hi^^ in Jury. etc.
Therefore king Herod blinded with envy and anger, being wholly bent to
destroy the child that was borne, pretended a cloak of Godliness unto his
wicked cruelty. He calls unto him all the chief of the order of priests,
and the Scribes of the people of Iewry, whose special profession was this,
that if there were any new matter that did arise, they should make answer out
of the sayings of the Prophets, and their godly books, because they
professed the exact knowledge of them, to the intent that both the number and
the authority should make the thing of more credit. Therefore when these were
called together, the king so much the more wicked, because he counterfeited
godlynes, demanded of them in what place the orasies or sayi^ges of God, did
promise that Christ should be borne. And they not yet rageing with haired
against Christ, whom they had not seen, answered simplye and without
delay: In Bethleem of Judah. And lest their authority should have but little
weight, behold they, have in a redines the prophecy of the Prophet Mitheas:
And thou Bethleem in the land of Judah, art no^ the least among the Princes of
Judah, for out of the shall spryng a ruler which shall rule my people of Israel.

And these things then answered the priests and the Scribes, who afterward
procured him to be slain, bright and notable with miracles, and doing good
unto all men. The king first of all greatly moved with the saying of the
Magians, was utterly amassed with this so ripe and ready an answer* chiefly
that the prophecy promised manifestlye a ruler of Bethleem which should rule
the people, of whom he was borne. Wherefore the priests and the Scribes being
sent away, because he was in despeyre for to deceive them, he calls ye
Magians privily unto him, lest the Jews might suspect any craft or guile,
and so opening the matter on each side as though he and they both purposed one
thing, inquired of the^ diligently how long it was since the sterre appeared
first unto them, by whose showing and poynting they had passed over so great a
journey, and came to Jerusalem: meaning and purposing this, the more certainly
to use and exercise his cruelty to the distruccion of that one newborn
child. The Magia^s (for godliness is not suspictouse) keep nor hide nothing
from him, not thinking him to be so cruel and fierce that he would show
cruelty upon an infant yet skante borne, neither so furiouse that he would
suppose to suppress by man's devise, the thing that was done by gods might:
When they had showed the time, he of the other side showed the place which he
had learned of the Scribes. And now he conceiving a sure hope that the child
might be taken by these two shewinges, gives commandment in his own name to
the Magians, which of themselves were willing to go, that they should go to
Bethleem, and seek out the child with great diligence: and when they had found
him, to return eftfones unto Jerusalem, and give him knowledge of all the
matter: (he pretended a very godly cause, and nothing displeasaunte to the
minds of the Magians) that I also (quod he) may follow you and wurshyp him.
He himself would first have knowledge of the child, to the inten^e he
might destroy him before that the people of the Jews had clear
understanding that he was borne. God in the mean time made this provision,
that the Magians returned safely to preach Christ in their own countries.
Otherwise if this ungracious man had not been deceived of his hope, he would
have used extremely the Magians themselves, which brought him so unlucky
tidings.

The godly simple Magians, after that they had heard the king, made haste unto
Bethleem, whom the sterre which called them forth, for a time did forsake, to
the intent, that the barbarouse people should first show unto the Jews that
Christ was borne, whom they lokyng for so many years, afterward did put to
death. But when they had passed over this part of Gods ordinance, again
appeared that wonderful star, which served their Godly purpose in such
wise, And when they saw y^ star. etc.
that it showed unto the^ not only Bethleem, but also the cotage it self,
being very low, poor, and bafe, and therefore very hard to find, yea and
hangyng very nere over the chyldes head, it did show and point, as it were
with a finger to the infant, whom they so fervently desired. Therefore when the
star began to appear again, it shook of and put a way all carefulnes from
their minds: and now replenyshed with sure hope and joy, and passing little
upon men's tellynges, but following the heavenly guide, they espy the palace
of the new king: a filthy and a vile cotage or stable. Sincere Godlynes is
nothing troubled with these things. They enter in: they find the infant not
differyng in apparaunce from others: they find the mother nothing gaye or
gorgious to look to. All their stuff showed and testified poverty and
simplicity. The Magians which did not worship nor fall down before Herod,
magnifying himself in his seat with a kingly pomp, fall down at the cradle
of the crying babe: they adoure and honor grouelyng on the ground, And fell
down flat and worshypped him.
him that could not yet speak. And their were not content with this godlynes,
but they take out of their boxes, gifts purposely appointed of those things
with increase of the which, the nation of the Persians was chiefly enriched,
that is, gold, incense, and myrre* lest that he which shortly after should be
compelled to flee, should lack in his vyage. And with these first fruits of
faith, the Gentiles that were far of preventing the Jews, which were thought
to be next unto God, do constitute Christ to be their king: and of the other
side do dedicate themselves unto him, offering a new sacrifice in three kinds
of things. And now as by a ryddell or a dark figure, they professed that
ineffable Trinity of the father, and the son, and the holy ghost,
acknowlegyng also in ^ne man mortality, priesthode, and kingdom. For gold is
for a king, incense for a priest, myrre for him that shall dye. He was borne
mortal, And being warned of god. etc
he did sacrifice on the cross, he conquered rising from death, he reygneth in
heaven. The Jews saw so many wonders, and when they knew him, they killed
him. The Magians saw no notable thing as concerning their bodily iyes, and
they rejoice that they had so fortunate a journey. But what time they devised
with themselves whether they should return unto Herod to satisfy his mind
and desire, they were admonished in their sleep, by the divine oracle, not to
return again to Herod. For that was neither suertie unto them, neither to
the child, neither expedient for such a weighty matter, which in time and by
parsell meal, should be promulgated and published unto the world. They spedely
did obey thoracle, and returned into their country another way, to be new
preachers of the new king among their country men.

Now the health and safety of the Magians was provided for, and that the
tranquillity both of the mother and of the child might forthwith be seen for,
Arise and take with thee ye child
and that also the ungodliness of Herod according unto his deserts, might more
and more be exasperated and grieved to the glory of Christ: the same heavenly
messinger which sent away the Magians, appeared unto Joseph in his sleep,
exhortyng him that now being priuye unto the mystery, he would conueye away
secretly the mother and the child into Egypt: whereby the divine counsel
intended this, that that region also being wholly given to the monstreous
worshippyng of gods, whiles it is become the host and re^eyuer of him that
is fled from his country: by the touching and having to do with him, it might
be prepared and made ready to some entry and beginning of true godliness.
Therefore the angel spoke unto Joseph with these words: Arise, and take with
thee the child and his mother, and flee privily into Egypt, and tarry there
until I return unto thee, and show thee the time to come hither again. For
it will come to pass, that Herod shall seek by all means to destroy the
child. Not that it is hard unto God suddenly to extinct and kill Herod, and
to preserve the child, if it please him, but this order of the matter is more
profitable for the confyrmacion and establyshment of faith. For it is gods
will that the fury and the rage of the tyranne shall set forth his glory.
Joseph not tarying, took the mother a maid, and the child, and flying in the
night season conveyed them into Egypt, there remaynyng till that Herod was
dead. Truly this thing chanced not by the fear of man or by fortune, it was
the will of God to prepare and to establyshe the kingdom of his son by these
adversities, by the which, worldly things be worst to be decayed and brought
to naught, lest that the world should take upon it any thing in divine
matters. And that thou may the better believe it, God who would this thing to
come to pass, prophesied many years past by the mouth of his prophet Osee,
saying: out of Egypt I called my son.

In the mean season king Herod, after that he perceived in deed that the
Magians had deceived him, now rageing in anger, cast away the cloak of
godlynes and bruste out into manifest rage, and sendyng forth ministers of his
madness, killed all thinfantes as many as were in Bethleem, and as many as were
in the coasts and the compass of the same town, which were of the age of two
year or you^ger, following the supputacion of the time, in the which the
Magians told him, that they saw first the star of the child. Cruelty
enlarged the time and the place, compassing in all the young children, supposing
that by this wicked counsel, he had provided surely enough, that he should
escape by no means, whom only he desired to be extincte and slain. But in
vain trauayleth the craft of men against the counsels of God. By these
things was showed a manifest example, what they should suffer of wicked
princes, that would believe the gospel, and what they should prevail that by
cruelty traueyled to extinguishe the faith of the gospel, being yet tender
and springing up in the hearts of the godly. To be killed for Christ, is to be
saved. Herod had an occasion to repent, and not to rage, if gredines to
reygne and to bear rule had not blinded his mind. But while he through his
own default turns al things into matter of greater madness, by his
maliciousnes he did set forth the justice of god. For it is manifest to al
men, that the innocent children were slain, with great cruelty, and that he
is worthy an horrible distruccion, wherewith afterward he was surely paid.

But lest any manne might doubt, that this thing came to pass by the
ordinance of God: hark to the prophecy of the Prophet Hiermy, seeing
through Gods inspiracion this thing, as though it had than been done already,
which many years after should come to pass. I voice (quod he) was heard in
Rhama, a voice sore weeping, sorrowful and lamentable. Rachel did bewail her
children and would receive no comfort because they were all slain. Rachel
bearing Benjamin, that is to say, the son of sorrow, by and by upon her
delivery dyed, and was buried not far from Bethleem, whereof the Prophet did
express in her person the sorrow and waylyng of the mothers, lamentyng their
children which Herod killed.

In the mean season after that Herod was taken out of the world by
punishment and vengeance most worthy for him, the angel again which gave
counsel to fly away, apperyng to Joseph in his sleep, moves him to leave
Egypt, and to bring again the child and his mother into the land of
Israel. For he said that they were dead that would have the child
destroyed. And he redely obeying in all things the will of God, conveyed Mary
being maid and mother together with her sweet babe, into the country of
Israel. For it behooved him first to be known unto them, unto whom chiefly
he was sent, to thintente the people of hard belefe, should have nothing why
they might make any reasonable pretense of their ungodliness, denying him to be
their Messiah, but to be some other appointed unto the Gentiles.

And as soon as Joseph entered into the coasts of his country, and had
knowledge there by a constante fame that Archelaus the soonne of Herod that
was dead, having the one half of his fathers kingdom reigned in Iewrye in
his fathers place, fearyng lest the soonne had succeeded his father in
cruelues, like as he did in his kingdom, durst not go thither: and again
being establyshed by the answer of the Angel, whereof now he wholly did
depend, went aparte into the coasts of Galile, which part had than
chanced unto Herod the Tetrarche brother to the king that was dead. Here the
Angel promised all thing to be safe, also the love of the country was an
inuitacion, and the counsel of God wrought withal, that Christ by many
occasions should be made common to many, whose cumming was to every manne.
Bethleem does glory of his birth, at Jerusalem he was circumcised and
purified, Egypt was happy of so noble a geast, Nazareth may well glory of his
brynging up. For this was the country of his mother, in the which she
conceived her son, a base and a poor vyllage of Galile, a country not
regarded but dyspised of the Jews, but it was a secret corner, so much more
meet for the child against the cruelty of Archelaus. And this point herein
god does teach us, that there is no need of helps, riches, power,
partetaking, or nobility of birth, in those things which are done by the will
of god. Nay these things annexed and put unto, rather obscure and darken the
glory of God among men. That it might be fulfilled. etc
For that this thing came not to pass by fortune it may appear, in that the
prophecy long before declared, that the Messiah should be called a Nazarene,
the which to be done, even the title does declare, which Pilate ignorant of
the prophecy, commanded to be set upon the cross. Jesus of Nazareth the king
of Jews. And at this day they that profess Christ be therefore of many called
Nazarenes. And the word it self has his mystery. Nazareth among the Hebrews
has his name of a flower, because that that godly and sweet flower the
sanctifier of all virginity was borne of a virgin, like as Bethleem signifies
unto the Hebrews the house of bread, out of the which came that heavenly
bread, which whosoever eats, shall live everlastingly. He therefore ^yued
certain years as one unknown, with his mother and his foster father Joseph,
whose son he was thought of all men, until the time he came unto man's
state, and then he showed himself unto the world by doctrine, miracles,
death, and resurreccion, being known or notable in nothing, nor exc^lyng other
men, but that he went forward daily and increased in all kind of honesty,
and heavenly gifts, that every man looked for some great and notable thing in
the child. He was also in the mean season a diligent obseruer of the law,
because he would give none occasion unto the evil wyllers, of evil saying or
back bytyng, but satisfye all men in all things. He had rather for a time by
keeping of the law, to bring the Jews to more perfeccion, than by despysyng
it, to alienate and withdraw their minds clean from him. Only once he showed
himself at Jerusalem, being twelve years of age, at what time he privily
leauyng his parents, was found in the temple sitting among the doctors,
hearing them, and by course questioning with them, insomuche that he was a
wonder to them all. Even than his godly disposicion had a desire unto those
things for which he was sent into the world: but as this was a praise of a
ready mind, so it was the example of moderation and obedience to tarry the time
prescribed of his father.

The.iii. Chapter.

Now is it worthy the hearing, to know how our Lord Jesus Christ began and
entered with the matier, that he came for. He thrust not in suddenly to men
unawares, when they thought not upon it. First he would that all men's minds
should be prepared, In those days came John the Baptiste.
and made in a redines by his vssher and messenger John the son of zachary,
a man known and allowed of the Jews themselves: to thentent that the thing
which ever should be believed, might by little and little be stilled and put into
the hearts of men. Therefore when the time drew nere, in the which it was
decreed by the eternal ordeynaunce of God that the whole world should be
renewed through the doctrine of Christ: John came forth, the son of a priest,
and of a prophetisse, which John was judged afterward to be more than a
Prophet by the testimony of Christ, who also even in his birth and beginning,
had made men to conceive great hope of him. And he came not out of kings
courts, Preaching in the wyldrenes of Iewry.
or out of common resortes of me^, but out of wilderness, where from his
chyldhode he led an angels life, being content with a most simple and common
diet, clad with a garment woue^ of Camels here is, girded with a letheren
girdell. His diet was agreeable unto his apparel. For he lived with course
meat, and easy to be gotten, which he found in the wilderness, that is to say,
with locustes and wild honey. Such diet, such apparel, such a place, was
most mete for a preacher of penance: Whose wonderful holiness so amassed all
men's minds, that many supposed that he was Christ: chiefly when many were
persuaded the other which was thought to be Messiah, to have perished in the
number of the infantes of Bethleem. But he did not challenge unto him the glory
of others, insomuche that he showed Christ openly to al men, and said that he
was not worthy to leu^e the latchet of his shoes. And yet he rushed not forth
of his own swinge to preach: but when he was admonished from heaven, that now
was the time to play the preacher. For he came not by chance to his office of
preaching, or by the sendyng of man, but this was he, For this is he, of who^
the prophet Esaias spoke
of whom Esaye prophesied so many years before, both that he should utter
openly in wyldernes the voice of his preaching, and also that he should be sent
before to prepare the hearts of men to receive the doctrine of Christ, and
because he persuading repentance of the former life, should make them able to
receive the grace of Christ, who by baptism should pardon all men of their
sins. And that (the course of things being suddenly changed) they that were
puffed up before by the vain justice of Moses law, and by the folysh wisdom
of this world, should have their combs cut, and be brought low. And finally
that they which before seemed vile, abject, and unprofitable because of their
ignorance and hu^blenes, should now be made lively and strong through the
doctrine of the gospel, and rich with heavenly riches: and those things
which by the rigor of the law seemed hard and intricate, through faith and
grace of the gospel, should be made right and easy: and that this health and
salvation, should be opened and publyshed not only to the Jews, but also to
all nations of the world. All these things prophesied Esaias, the most assured
Prophet of the Lord. And this is the prophecy: A voice of the crier in
deserte, prepare ye the way of the lord, make his paths plain and even.
Every valey shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low.
And the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough shall be turned into plain
ways, and all mankind shall see the salvation of God. And now a certain
rumor and fame of the cumming of Christ, secretly spread abroad by many, and
farther the conscience of their naughty lives (for there was no time more
sinful and fylthy than that was) and finally a certain secret inspiracion
did cause and brought to pass, that many of them were weary of their life,
being very desirous of him, of whom they had a certain savor and
understanding (simple though it were:) who suddenly should renew all kind of
men, and their sins clearly abolyshed, bring them unto the kingdom of
righteousness. Wherefore when they came flockyng unto John not only out of the
city of Jerusalem, but also out of whole Iewry, chiefly out of those
countries that be nere unto Iordane: John himself cummeth and approaches to
satisfy their ready will and desire. And the thing that he preached in
wyldernes, the same he does beat into the people, being now more thycke
assembled and gathered together nere unto the water of Iordane, that through
repentance of their former life, they might prepare themselves to Messiah now
at hand, and offer themselves to be healed of him, And were baptized of him in
Iordane* etc
who should bring health and salvation. He is in the way of health, that
knowlegeth his disease, and hates it. For now (says he) the kingdom of
heaven, and that same most fortunate and most to be desired kingdom is at
hand: yea and that very nere, but there is no entry into it, but to such as
be pure and clean, from this worldly filthiness. At this preaching, in figure
and toke^ that the filthynes of the minds should shortly be cleansed away,
many were baptized in the water of Iordane condemning their former life, and
acknowlegyng their offenses openly. For so it was thought good unto the
wisdom of god, that John which was the bound and border of Moses law, being
now at an end, and of the grace of the gospel now cumming on, with this
sign and token, should go before, not to abolishe sin, which thing Christ
properly reserved unto himself, but to prepare men's minds, that they might
be the more able to receive the benefit that should furthwith ensue.

able to bring to pass, that of these stones, children shall rise up to
Abraham. Even now is the axe also put to the root of the trees. Therefore
every tree, which brings not ^urthe good fruit, is he wen down and cast
into the fire. And this was done in the.xv. year of Tiberius Caesar, being
Emperor of Rome, and Poncius Pilate having rule over Iewry under him, and
Herod the brother of him that dyed, being Tetrarche of Galile, where Christ
made his abode: and his brother Philip Tetrarche of Iturea, and the country
Trachonisis: and Lisanya the Tetrarche of Abiline: and Anne, and Cayphas, being
the chief of the priests. And thus the realm of Iewry being divided unto so
many rulers, furthe came he which should call things to the power and rule of
one prince. And first of all, a great number of people flockyng unto him, wha^
John saw a great multitude of Phariseis and Saduceis come to baptism, and was
not ignorant how this kind of people was arroga^t, fierce, and standing in
their own conceyte, for the notable obseruacion of Moses law as it seemed to
themselves, and for the merits of the patriarchs, of whom they craked and
gloryed much, for that they came of them. For they envying and laying wait to
hinder the baptism of John, being in use and reputacion, sent a craftye
message unto him into Bethabaram, (for John at that time did baptize there)
demau^dyng whether that he were Christ. If he had been, forthwith they would
have objected, that Christ had been promised of the tribe of Judah, whereas it
was manifest that John was of the Tribe of Leuy. Further when John protested
plainly that he was not Christ, no nor no Prophet, especially of those old
and aunciente Prophets, whom they thought would return again the world*
they demand of him further, how he durst promise remission of sins by
baptysme, which properly was reserved unto Christ. He answered, that there was
much difference between his baptism, whereby he did stir and move me^ to
repentance and forthynkyng of the former life: and the baptism of Christ
which forthwith should follow, whereby all sins should be forgeuen. Therefore
when he saw many of this kind of men come runnyng to baptism with others: He
said unto them: O generation of vipers.
he biteth their conscience with bitter words whereby he might the rather move
them to penance. O crafty (quod he) and malicious kind of men, nay no men,
but rather the offspring of vypers, the murderers of your auncetours, subtle
and ill minded toward all men: Seeing that hitherto ye have vaunted your selves
among men, under the title and name of fathers, which for their holiness be
much praise wurthy with them, and under the false pretense of righteousness,
have reigned so negligently and idelly, as though Messiah should never have
come, who told you, and put you in remembrance, that the inevitable
punishmente was at hand, unless ye had run with others to the remedy of
penance? And how is it, that now ye desire to be baptized as sinners, among
whom ye appeared as men of great holiness? Ye have perceived that your trust
should be but vain, unless ye should escape from the vengeance of God now
being at hand* by the refuge of penance. For neither the merits of the
fathers, nor the obseruacion of the law, delivers from everlasting
punishment, but every man's own pureness of life makes him commendable unto
God. Seeing therefore yt ye repent your former life, hereafter so bring forth
fruit with godly affeccions and deeds, that they may testify, that ye have
truly repented. Hitherto for the grossenes of men, fygures and shadows has
been sumwhat made of, that men's pronitie to naughtines, being compassed in with
these stays, might be refrayned from falling into farther inconvenience.
Hitherto with enlarged Phylacteries, with long prayers, with washinges, with
often mencioning of father Abraham the holy Patriarche, with buildyng of the
prophets shrynes, of whose posterity ye desire to appear and to be counted,
ye have obtained unto you a certain color and appearaunce of holiness among
men. Hereafter because that shadows shall vanyshe away at the light of the
gospel, ye must go truly and sincerelye to work, if ye will obtain
everlasting health. Neither brent sacrifice, ne blood of beasts, is required
of you for your old sins: only ^e that there be penance without
counterfaytyng, and god will freely pardon the offense: further Messiah himself
will teach you, if he find you apt and willing to learn, what be the fruits
of true penance. In the mean season set ye aside vain trust, and flatter not
your selves thus: we be holy, we come of the holy father Abraham. The just
Abraham shall avail nothing them that come of him, unless they follow his
faith and obedience, which were so much commended. The blessyng that is now at
hand was promised unto Abraham: but cosinage and kynred be it never so nere, is
not sufficient to obtain this blessyng. Whosoever distrustyng God does lean
unto the soucoures of this world, they be fallen from the kindred of Abraham.
And hereafter the posterity of Abraham shall not be counted by the kynred of
blood, but by the sincerity of feyth. And yet god shall not therefore lack the
posterity of Abraham, to whom he may perform and pay the blessing that he
promised, though ye swerve from the manners of Abraham. Nay be ye ascertayned,
if ye dispyse the grace offered unto you, that god is of power, yea out of
these stones to raise up children far better than ye be, to his friend
Abraham. And there is no cause why that ye should be the more negligente for
that the cummyng of Messiah has been differred hitherto. For now the extreme
parell cummeth upon you, and now all the matter is even upon the edge of the
raser, either ye must come unto the kingdom of heaven with clean and
sincere minds, or else ye must receive eternal punishment. Salvation is
present at hand to them that will enbrace it, and to them that will refuse it,
present pain and utter destruction is ready at hand. For now the axe is
set to the tree, not to the boughs or to the body, but to the roots, which
shall utterly cut it down with a deadly wound, that cannot be recovered,
unless it bring forth fruit meet for god. There must be no lingering, the
daungier is so nere at hand. Haste must be made, all impedime^tes and lettes
quite cut of. Yet ye may chose which ye will take. The axe will not stryke if
ye will suddenly change your mind. In the natural tree it is long and hard to
change the juice whereof the fruit takes his taste. Here the matter is
brought to pass by the only will. But as they that make haste are partakers of
health, so they that linger are al partakers of peril. None shall be delivered
hereafter neither by riches, neither by noble birthe, neither by wisdom, as
many hitherto have supposed. Every tree that bears not fruit, and that no
mean fruit but excellent good and worthy the kingdom of heaven, is cut
down and cast into the fire.

Hitherto god has suffered and wynked at men's sluggishnesse. Error and
ignorance deserved some pardon. Mankind was in a manner deaffe at the law of
nature. Small profit came by ye law of Moses. The thretninges of the prophets
were set at naught, their dreams and visions were not heard. Now is he come
after whom none other shall be sent. Whose cu^ming lest it should be sodeine
and unawares, I (says John) am the messenger sent before. If ye be penitent,
if ye knowledge your diseases, if ye receive ye Physician with fervent desire,
he will be with you, profitable and healthful to all: For I am not he* whom ye
look for. Truth it is I baptize you, but to this intent only, y^ ye being
penitent may be mere to learn of him, and ready to receive health wha^ he shall
come. For forthwith he will come, yea eue^ now he is cum, and as he is behind
me in ye order of preaching, so he is above me and passes me by all means, so
yt I whom ye think to be of sum estimacio^, am not worthy to be his drudge and
slave, I baptyse you with water. etc
that is either to carry his shoes, or to leuse yt latchet of his shoes. I am
none other thing but a preacher, nevertheless both trusty and doing mine office,
which god has enioined me by ye prophecy of his prophet. He is the author, he
bri^geth with him al might and power both to forgive si^nes, and to co^fer and
give al kind of virtues. Let every man approach to his doctrine and to his
baptism, for he shall baptize you with effectual and lively baptism, not with
water only but with ye spirit and fire. With ye spirit he shall alter and
tra^sforme you, with fire he shall pluck you up unto heavenly things. He will
require nothing of you but sincere penance, without cou^terfeyting. He will give
you his good things freely, if your ill things displease you heartily. Only he
wills yt there be no colouringes, which shall preuail nothing with him. There
is nothing hid from him, he fears no man. The thing shall be done with severe
judgment, which can not be voided. Hereafter there shall be no mean, either
ye must thoroughly be good, or thoroughly evil. He will pass nothing upon
cloked^ holiness* He has a fa^ne in his hand, he sees also y^ inward secrets
of the hearts. Before him either ye must be chafe or fine wheat. Whose fa^ne
is in his hand.
But in the mean season whether of both ye will be, he has partly put in your
choice. It shall be but vain for the chafe mingled among the clean corn to
luck and to be hidden. He shall utterly cleanse his floor, and lay up the
wheat in his granard, but he shall burn the chafe with fire that never shall
be quenched. Wherefore either ye must endeavor with all your heart to the high
prycke of virtue, that ye may worthily be received into the everlasting
kingdom: or else if ye despise the goodness of God now offered unto you, ye
must needs thereby be extremely naught, because ye refuse so great health
offered to you, without your seking, and through your own merit (forasmuch
as ye reject the heavenly reward,) ye must be appointed to the everlasting
fire of hell. The minds of the common sort were so moved with the sayings of
this holy man, that a great number which hitherto had put their trust in the
obseruacion of the law, came unto him tremblyng for fear, and said: If thus
stands the case, what than think ye best for us to do? but he did not exhort
the^ to the ceremonies of the law, and the constitucions of men, as the
phariseis were wont to do, but unto the works of charity, saying: The first
way to pacify God is the free weldoyng unto your neighbor. He that has
plenty of garments, let him give unto the naked: he that has plenty of
meats, let him give unto the hungry. There came unto him also the Publicanes,
the which kind of me^ ye Jews abhor, because co^me^ly either for to please
the princes, or to satisfy their avarice they are wo^t to poul ye people. They
demand of him fearfully, what he thi^keth best for the^ to do. And he does
not reject them from baptism, and again he appoynteth them not to give their
goods, who now of long time were wont violently to take away other men's: but
to the intent they might come nere by some degree unto the perfect doctrine of
Christ, he commands them that they should exact nothing of the people,
beside that, that was prescribed of the prince. Finally there came also
soldiers, a violent and a diffamed kind of people. Neither put he them away
from him, declaring manifestlye unto the Jews by that deed, that Christ would
despise no kind of men. They confess nothing: for, to profess a soldier is
of it self to confess the puddle and sink of all mischief. They demand
also what counsel he would give the^. And he teaches them being so rude,
rather what ought to be avoided and shunned, that they might be less ill,
then what was to be done, whereby they might be perfectly good. Abuse not (quod
he) your weapons which ought not to be styrred but against your enemies, at the
commandment of the captayn: beat no man nor stryke no man violentlye, sith
you be hired for this purpose, that through your diligence the country should
be quiet. Nor abuse not you familiarity with great rulers, falsely blamyng and
accusyng any man, whereby any filthy lucre or gain might come unto you. Finally
be content with your wages, and defraude and spoil no man. For princes give
wages to thintente no man by necessity should be forced to take other men's
goods. So he through easy precepts according to every man's capacity, made
al men in a redines for Christ to come, foreseyng Christ in spirit, whom he
had not yet seen with his bodily iyes.

Therefore the rumor and fame being now spread abroad, and daily more and more
increasing, and that by diverse means, by the angels, by the sheperdes by the
Magyans, by the cruel carefulnes of Herod, by the prophecye of zachary, by
Simeon, by Anne, by little and little secretly: but most of al by John's open and
manifest setting forth being joined with a great authority, inso much that
ill me^ also being now amassed with fear did frame themself to the cumming of
Christ, thus declared and set forth. For truly it was time for him to cu^ forth
into the sight of the world to declare himself not by ye testimonies of others,
but by his own virtues, yt it might appear what manner of one and how mighty he
was, and that he might obscure and darken al men, by whose testimony he was
heretofore set forth and commended. Therefore Jesus left Galile where he had
been in secret hitherto, and now goi^g about his fathers business he leueth
his mothers cu^trey Nazareth, and makes speed unto Jordan, where he should
have a great company gathered together out of diverse coasts of Iewry, Then
cummeth Jesus,
to be a witness of the things yt should be there spoken and done. He who alone
was defiled with no spot of sin, yea who alone should take away ye sins of the
world, through ye mids of the sinful companies, even like a sinner goes unto
John, and requires to be baptized of him, who alone does sa^ctifie every
baptism. John not yet ascerteyned yt Jesus was that high Messiah, the son of
god, but yet observing and marking a meruaylouse semelynes and honesty apperyng
in his iyes, But John forbad him
in all his countenance, and in his manner of going, he does excuse his
disordered office and ministracion, honoring his dignity and worthiness as yet
with no certain commendacion. Only he says, it were mete and convenient
that I which am far beneth and under thy virtues, should require baptism of
the: And how cummeth it to pass that thou do humble and adbase thy self so
low, to require baptism of me, since no man is more pure and clean from al
sin than thou? These things were thus done by the ordinance of god, to
thinte^t both that we should have an example of the merueilous modesty and
humility of Christ, and also that it might appear unto all men by the
testimony of John, that Christ being without conscience of any sin or evil,
required to be baptized. For he was baptized like as he was circumcised, as he
was purified in the temple with his mother, as he was scourged, and as he was
crucified. He suffered all these things for us, and not for himself. Wherefore
when John declaring consta^tly his own unworthiness, and setting forth ye
worthiness of Christ, Jesus answers* etc
did refuse ye office of a baptiser, Christ by no sinister suspicion did steine
his own innocence, which it behooved to be known and believed of al men. Every
part (quod he) of this business has his time. Be thou content in the mean
season that I be baptized of the, think not vn^u^ly for the, if thou baptize
him, who (as thou say) is better the^ thou. Certainly it shall becu^ me,
which desires to bring al unto me, to fulfill all justice. For he that
teaches al, and teaches perfeccio^, must see that no likelyhode or apparau^ce
of unrighteousness (be it never so little) be found in his life and manners. I
must become all things to al men, that I may win and bring al unto my
father. When John heard these words, he descended into Iordane with Christ,
and baptized him. And here appears an wholesome example of humility in Christ,
and of obedience in John, but the thing, and the effect is of contrary order.
For baptism does consecrate us, but he through the holy touching with his body
did consecrate baptism.

And to the intent he might declare unto us what we ought to do after baptism,
and what felicity was given us by baptism, Jesus going out of the water
cherefully and spedely as though he had cast of a great burden of sines
(teaching us that we should not tarry nor linger in washinges, nor ofte^tymes
return unto the^ by sinning again, but to make haste to the duties of a
spiritual life, the sins of the former life once cast of, and buried in
baptism:) kneled down upon his knees, and lifted his hands unto heaven,
beseching his father yt he would vouchesafe that this matter of saving
mankind, which he took in hand, might be happy and fortunate to all men, and
that he would commend and set forth his son unto the world with his fatherly
authority: and lest John's authority should be of small estimacio^, albeit this
for ye time was profitable for the gross and rude people. And behold the
father did manyfestly auctorise his son in the presence of such a multitude
of people. The heavens opened and showed furthe a certain wonderful light.
John also saw the heavenly spirit in the visible lykenes of a dove, And lo
heaven was open unto him
to descend out of heaven, and to sytte upon his holy head: from thence came
the voice of the father soundyng to all men's ears, saying: this is my derely
beloved son, the delight of my mind, in who^ I have a singular pleasure,
hear him the expou^der of my mind, and the distributer of my goodness toward
you. And because at that time Jesus was unknown to the multitude which had a
great opinion of John, lest the voice, which cu^ming from above poynted no man
certaynely to their understanding, should be thought to perteine unto John:
therefore there was added a visible sign of the heavenly dove, which sitting
upon Christ's head, showed now plainly unto al me^ (as a man would point
with his finger) to whom that voice did perteine. With the which sign also
John himself was plainly and certainly monished, that he was the son of
God. And after he did openly testifye that this sign and token was promised
him before of the father, to the intent that in such a multitude of people,
he might certeynlye know him that afterward should baptyse all men in the
spirit and fire. And with these ceremonies the Lord Jesus was declared and
consecrated our master, whose divinity, and heavenly doctrine who so will
follow, he shall be truly blessed.

The.iiii. Chapter.

ANd yet these entries and beginninges made, he lepeth not forth byanby to
preach, although authority were given him from heaven, but suddenly he
withdraws himself from the sight of the people into wilderness, because yt,
departure from the company, of people both increases authority, and provoke
a desire. Now ye spirit (that is the prouoker of the ill) does specially
assault them which leauyng the desires of the world, do fall into meditacion
of the pure and heavenly life. Therefore Jesus secretly teaching us the same,
goes into wyldernes. And this he does not by ye mocion or instigacion of any
man, but moved of his own spirit. For he that is baptized, has now cast of
carnal affeccions, and being made spiritual by regeneracion, is led and moved
by the counsel of the holy ghost: he remembers not Bethleem, he retourneth
not to Nazareth, he goes not again to his mother or to his foster father, but
by the veheme^cy and rauishing of ye spirit, he goes into deserte, following
the exau^ple of the old prophets. Solytarines does quicken and make lusty
the mind of a Christian soldier, and some time it is more sure for a man to
commit himself to the wild beasts, than to men. Baptism takes away all
sins of the former life, but for all that, no man is sure from the assaults
of Satan which lives sluggyshly. But yet the naughty desires endeavor to
spryng again, chiefly in them that be rude and young, and lately entered and
cummen to Christ. And that froward Satan envying as much man's salvation, as
Christ is desyrouse of the same, styrreth and provoke him with merueylouse
engines and sleyghtes, to fall away and depart: insomuche that he possesses
and uses him that is relapsed with more tyranny, then he did possess and use
him when he had him before. Against these perilles and dangers Christ
shows chiefelye three remedies, often and hearty prayers, forsakyng of
company, avoiding of excess, and keeping abstinence, not without diligent
meditacion of holy scriptures: for otherwise there may be danger in idle
solytarines. And because the devil goes about to deceive them chiefly, which
do endeavor to attain unto this straight and Angelical life: Christ himself
like a good captain encounteryng with him, has taught his champions, by what
means that maliciouse and crafty old sire may be overcome, and how little he
can do against them that be sober and vigilant, and with all their heart do
lean to the godly scriptures. And this also the Lord Jesus in the mean time
went about, that this mystery might, by little and little appear unto the
world after such sort, that Satan (which desired for none other purpose to
know certainly whether he were the son of God, whom he heard that the
father did honor with this title and name, but to let the redemption of
mankind) might be holden in such doubt, that he might not certeynlye know
this to be Messiah, before he saw his own tyranny utterly subverted and
overthrown. Christ also puts us in remembrance of this, that no man is
mete to preach the gospel, but he that has tried himself, and is fyrme and
strong against worldly desires, against excess and her companions, that is,
bodily lust, ambicion, avarice, and such like diseases of the mind,
wherewith our enemy beats and shakes the minds of the simple and weak as
it were with most violent engyns of war. Therefore when Christ had fasted
fortye days, following Hely, and Moses, which thing was in such wise above
man's power, that yet the Jews believed, that it was done of men: at last to
show a manifest token of man's imbecillitie in himself, And wha^ he had
fasted forty days
he made no counsel, but showed plain signs that he felt the tediousnes of
hungre. For after the common nature of man's body, the lack of humor grieved
and payned the stomach.

The temptour came.
Which thing when the crafty temptoure perceived* thynkyng him to be nothing
but a man, (although in deed a notable and a wonderful man,) he casts his
hook bayted with ye enticement of vain glory, for therewith chiefly they be
taken, which seem to endeavor to the highest perfeccion. If thou be the son
of God (quod he) what nedest thou to be grieved and piened for hungre? Command
rather these stones to be turned into bread for thy behoufe. Thou canste
perform thy desire with a beck. But he answered.
Ye may well know of old that this is the same liar in wait, or teptour
which did entice that first Adam into the snares of death, by the vayte or
train of gluttony: But Christ the latter Adam being in spirit heavenly, so
avoided with his words, this crafty and deceitful waiter, that neither he
refused the name of the son of God, nor yet himself to be overcome with
hungre after the common sort of men. And because he would not take upon him
to answer of his own authority: he lays unto him a manifest scripture,
saying: It is written in the Deuteronomi: Man shall not live only of bread,
but of every word, that cummeth out of the mouth of God.

For it is written: he shall give his angels charge over the, and with their
hands they shall hold the up, lest at any time thou dashe t^y foot against
a stone. And Jesus said to him: Again it is written: Thou shalt not tempte
the Lord thy God. Than Satan being eluded and shaken of with this doubtful
answer, does even of his party also abuse the words of scripture to do
hurt and myschiefe: And as he deceived the first parente of mankind with the
bait of ambicion, promysyng him eguall honor and immortality with God: by a
like guyle assaylyng the lord, he took him up into the holy city, and when he
had set him upon the high Pinnacle of the temple, he exhorted him if he were
the very son of God, that he would fall down hedlong, alleagyng that he
could take no harm by so dooyng. For God himself had thus promised in the
mistical psalm. He will give his angels commandment and charge over the, and
they shall take the in their hands, lest thou should hurt thy foot at any
stone. But the lord Jesus laiyng scripture against him again, gives a secret
understanding, how peruers^y he wrested the sense of the holy scripture.
Contraryewyse (quod he) it is written in the Deuteronomie: Thou shall not tempt
the lord thy God. For scripture does exhort us to this poyncte, that when
aduersitye and danger is at hand, we should have a good hope trustyng upon
the help of god, and not put our selves rashely in danger. The miracles of
godly men be not tried by sekyng of perils, but by auoydyng dangers when
they chance. For it is no godly poyncte for to cast a man headlong into the
river, that by delivering of him thou may seem to be a man of great feats,
but it is a godly thing to pluck out him yt by chance is fallen in. Nor
miracles be not to be done for every thing, nor amongst all men. Jesus would
not once vouchsafe to speak before Herod* who was desirouse of such things,
much less would he show any sign or token of his godly power, at the
request of Satan. So often as charity inspired with the holy ghost, desires
it, so often as the glory of God requires it, the power of God is to be showed
abroad.

Now to thintente that Christ might teach such as be his not to give
themselves to a careless security, after they had the higher hand once or
twyse, but always to keep watch, and to be in a readiness for all assaults
of Satan, he suffered also the third time, thinportune assailing of the
temptour who as he deceived the first Adam, with the bayte of curiosity and
auaryce, promising him the knowledge of good and evil, so in likewise he
sets upon the latter Adam, and took him from the pinnacle of the temple, and
led him into a very high hill, where he might look at liberty far and
wide, and see all the kingdoms of the world, and the woondrefull glory and
pomp of each of them. Surely he knew by experience of other men, that there
was nothing so wicked and sinful, but they would take it in hand to obtain
rule and dominion. But albeit God is ye author and maker of al things in
heaven and earth, and the devil has no title nor interest in them, unless he
has viciated and defiled any thing: yet as though he were lord over all, he
is not affrayed thus to speak unto Christ: I will give the al these
kingdoms, if thou will fall down and honor me. O blind impiety. The
ungracious spirit promyseth an other man's gooddes, and asks honor due unto
god only. But Jesus who hitherto took the reproach of himself well in worth,
Tha^ says Jesus unto him.
cannot bear his fathers ignomynie. Hence Satan (quod he:) Thy counsel is
far from the doctrine of holy scripture. The scripture says: Thou shalt
adoure the lord thy God and him only shall thou serve. After that the deiuil
had tempted him by these and like other ways, finding him always to be
valiaunte and an invincible cha^pion, against all inuencions and ingins, he
left him at last, being disapoyncted of his purpose two ways. Then the devil
leaves him.
First in that he perceived that Christ was invincible. Secondly, where as he
came to search, whether he was the son of God or no, he departed more
uncertain then he came. This conflicte was made in the sight of God and his
Aungelles, the which the lord Jesus would not have unknown unto his, to
thyntent we might know with what a cumberous enemy we should have to do, and
with what wages and rewards, he would stir and provoke ignorant and unware
minds. And this did he not that we should despair, but that we should
diligently watch and take good head. Christ overcame him to show unto us that
he was vincible and taught us how we also might geat victory of him. Finally
he overcame for us and not for himself, purposyng by us to overcome the same,
if we deserve to have him present with us. And by us he shall hear Christ
say: Hence Satan, and he shall fear the servants of him of whom he was
ouercumme. Further-like as in worldly war, And behold the angels came,
things have their course and order, and labors be eased with rest, and
sorofull things with pleasant, and after fore conflictes triumphs be made:
so in the war of Christ sore storms of tentacion be mitigated with myrthe
and ioyfulnes. After the cumberouse frowardenes of the filthye spirit, by and
by the Aungelles be ready to serve and wait upon Christ the conqueror. Surely
this exaumple teaches us, how in adversity we should stay our mind with
hope of better, trustyng upon ye goodness of god, which so doethe order al
things, that now and than he does exercise and prove the valiauntnes of his
warriers, with trouble and adversity: and again with sum solace does provoke
them to reioysyng and thanks geuyng, which is the tryumphe of Christen men.
And in affliccions through the help of God, they be invincible: and if any
prosperity come unto them, they ascribe it wholly to the goodness and
bountifulnes of god. And so it cummeth to pass that neither they be
discouraged in adversity, nor insolente or proud in prosperity.

Therefore when Christ began to be of authority and estimacion, chiefly after
that John had in manier delivered him and commended him to his disciples
poynctyng with his finger, and saying: Behold the lamb of god, behold him
that takes away the sins of the world: and after that he had ouercum the
devil and was fully inspired with the holy ghost, nothing now remained, but to
take a time and place, to begin and enter his preaching.

John had wrought no miracle, being content only to preach penance. Christ
kept silence so long as he preached, lest any discord might rise among their
discyples, When Jesus had heard* etc.
being yet rude, carnal, and given to worldly affeccions. Surely it is ye part
of a good teacher, to conform himself to the capacity of his audience. But
than and not before entrethe he the office of teaching, when the rumoure was
blown abroad, that John was cast into prison of Herod the Tetrarche,
enjoying the reward that they be wont to have, which dare boldly speak before
the Princes of this world, and will rather speak holsum things than pleasant.
For he told the Tetrarche of his unlawful marriage, because he married his
brother Philippes wife. And sumtyme evil princes desire to have in household
with them, men of great and notable honesty, not that they would obey the
counsel of such, but because they ma^e seem to the ignoraunte people, to do
by their advise and counsel, whatsoever they do after their own lust and
appetite. And in other things of light importance, he had oftentimes ben
obedient to his monicions, but here, where he ought most to have been
obedient, at the foul request of a filthy daunling damsel, and at the desire
of her filthye mother, he had cast that very good man into prison, and
afterward with the cruel death of such a great man, he defiled the feast
of his Nativity, and the iyes of his nobles. Jesus therefore when he heard of
this, not because he was in fear himself, but to teach his not wyllingly to
put themselves in danger, if they may conuenientlye avoid it, but when it
cummeth stoutely to neglecte it, leauyng Nazareth went a side into Galile of
the Gentyles, (in the which Solomon gave unto Hira king of the Tyrians.xxv.
cytyes, He went aparte into Galile.
) and went into the city of Capernaum, therefore taken to be borderyng upon the
sea, because it is nere the standing water of Genezareth, in the coasts of
zabulon and Neptalim, which were two trybes, and in the first is Galile, in
the second is that, that is called Galile of the Gentiles: whereby Christ
than as by a figure, in manier thretned, that when the Jews did refuse and
persecute the preachers of the gospel, than the gospel should be brought unto
the Gentyles. And lest that a man might think that this thing was done by
chance, Esai being inspyred with the spirit of prophecy, prophesied long
before that it should so be, That it might be fulfilled. etc.
saying: in the land of zabulon and the land of Neptalim, which bordereth upon
the sea, in Galile of the Gentyles, the people which heretofore dwelled in
darkness, has seen a great and a merueylouse light, and unto them which
heretofore were in a thick darkness such as is in hell, light is sprung up.
Therefore, as concerning the time, where John left, there Christ begins. For
at the clear light of the gospel, the shadows of Moses law do vanishe away.
And this is spoken directely concerning the mystical figures of the law, and
to express the truth of the gospel. But as touching the place, at the first
affliccion and trouble of the holy preacher, the name of the Gentyles is goen
unto, and the light which the Jews blinded with filthye desires, could not
suffer, is as it were in a picture declared to pass over from them to the
Gentyles, being very Idolaters: but after such sort that the coasts of
neither is forsaken, so that of both sides the trumpe of the voice of the
gospel may be heard. And yet furthermore that country was no unprofitable
auditorie, by reason of the commodity of havens, and certain notable cities
standing upon the sea side, which by the reason of the course of marchaundise,
were frequented and used also of far cummers, out of other strange countries.

From that time Jesus began to preach and say: Repent, for the kingdom of
heaven is at hand. Now let us hear the beginning of his preaching. As he
succeeded after John, so he begins with his doctrine, which was well known,
and familiar, lest he should have driven them away from him, which had John
now in so great venecacyon. And he fedeth the weak with milk, that
afterward he might bring forth strong meat to them when they were of more
strength. And truly this is ^horder of teachers, which desire rather to
profit the hears, than to set forth, and magnify themselves before other.
The preaching of Christ is not only more mild and gentle than John his
preaching (for he makes no mention neither of axe, nor of fan, nor of fire
that never shall be quenched) but also more ^o be commended, for many benefits
bestowed upon all men indyfferently. Jesus therefore following John, cries and
says: Change your minds and repent your former life. For now the kingdom
of heaven is at hand, the which as it shall be shut unto no man, so it shall
be open only unto them that be pure and clean, and seek after heavenly
things, and cut away al worldly desires. What can be more plain and simple
than this Philosophy? Let every man be displeased and grieved with his own
naughtynes, and heavenly things be ready for him at hand, and that freely.

And now the time was come, that Jesus should gather together a company of
disciples, which should be famyliar witnesses of all his doings and sayings,
and by whom he might teach other afterward. But mark what manier of men he
chose, not Philosophers, not Phariseis, not Priests not rich men. For he
would not that the glory of the gospel should be defiled' with any worldly
aid and succor. But as he walked near the water which (as we said before)
was in the border of both Galilees, he espied two brothers german, the name
of the one was Simon, and he was called also Peter, the other was named
Andrewe, whose fathers name was John. These before that time heard John,
through whose prouocacion they began to follow Jesus. But they left them both,
and turned again to their faculty and craft, whereby they were wont to get
their living. And now they were bustlye occupied castyng their nets into the
sea. It was a sign of good luck. First youth more ready to receive the new
doctrine: further the agreablenes of brethren one ready to help another:
Again a craft and faculty in which was no hurt: whereby they got a poor
living out of the common mere or poole: Finally the fishyng put them in
remembrance of the new fisshyng, which served not to take fishes with nets
to feade the belly, but with the net of the gospel to catch men drouned
with worldly cares, unto desire of the heavenly life. Therefore as they were
occupied about necessaries for their body, Christ speaks unto them, saying:
Follow me, and ye shall learn a science of me, better than ever ye learned of
your father. And yet ye shall not leave your science, but ye shall change it
to a better fashyon. For I will make you hereafter fysshers of men, that ye
which wait for fishes to destroy them, may catch and take men into
everlasting salvation. They knew the voice of him, whom before they did
believe, and whose gentilnes they had proved before with familiar
communicacion. But through the strength and efficacy of his voice, he brought
to pass, that forthwith at the word of the caller, they forgot not only
their fish, but also their nets as they were they left them there, and not
byddyng their acquayntaunce once fare well they followed Jesus even as he
walked. They saw no great thing yet in Jesus, notwithstanding they stayed not
nor lingered nothing, nor were not careful how they should get their living
hereafter, but joined themselves to him, calling them with his only word,
and followed him, and would not away to dye therefore.

Jesus going a litell further espied other two brothers, James and John the
sons of zebedeus: he was the better please^ for that the brethren and the
father agreed so well together. They were al in one bot^, endeuoryng one thing
even the fame that Peter and Andrewe were about. But these went not spedely
forward with their business, because their nets were broken with long
wearyng, which was a token of pouertye: Jesus therefore passing by as they were
earnestly occupied in mendyng of their nets, spoke unto them, and bad them
follow him. The young men of a plain confidence and trust, without any
tariyng, furthwith leauyng their nets, and forgetting their father also, bend
themselves to follow Jesus: so the preaching of John had framed and fashioned
them, so deserved the towardness and readiness of their hearts, so had the
inspiracion of Christ drawn them, who wholly breathed and sauoured of the
heavenly spirit, wherewith he was replenished.

Ye see the entrynges of our Philosophye, whereby it was thought good unto god
to save all mankind. Ye se the pomp and ruffling of the euangelycall schole.
Poor Jesus being accumpanyed with these few fishers, unlearned, of the common
sort, and poor men, walked over all Galile, not now in corners nor in
deserte, but in their Synagoges, where was most resort: preaching and showing
that the kingdom of heaven which had heretofore been promised was now at
hand: not puttyng them in fear of hell fire like as John did, but inuiting
and allurynge all men with free benefits. For wheresoever he went he healed
all men's diseases indifferently, and freely, refusing no man, were he never
so vile, and of the meanest sort, and with like easynesse he chased a way all
diseases, were they never so incurable: to the intent both to set forth and
declare by miracles, his power to be greater than man's, and also through free
benefits, to purchase and win the love of all men. For him we gladly
trust and believe, whom we love.

Yea even the wild beasts also be wunne with benefits. Surely there is no
benefit more godly, than freelye to restore health. By these means it came to
pass, that the fame of him spredde abroad throughout all Syria, and many
brought from a far their diseased folk encumbered with diverse dyseases and
griefs, and besides these such as were possessed with devils, and Lunatikes,
and diseased with the palsy, whom Phisicyons commonly either take not upon
them to cure, or else be wont to cure in vain, because the disease passes
their art and cunnyng. But Jesus healed all easily, not with man's medicynes,
And those that had the palsy* etc.
but with heavenly virtue, wherwyth he was hable also to raise the dead. It was
a small matter to him to take away the diseases of the bodies, which took
away the diseases of the minds. It was a small matter for him to prolong the
life of the body, which came to give everlasting life unto all men. There
came therefore from this part and that part, a wonderful number of people,
not only from Galile of the Gentiles where he was, And there followed him* etc.
but also out of the other Galile, which was beyond the water, and out of
the country that was called Decapolis, because of the ten cities which were
in it, also out of Jerusalem and the residew of Iewry, and out of the places
which were beyond Iordane. All men as they have need run to a benefit. Many
be moved with novelties. Sum came for malice with a mind to wait displeasure.
Jesus (for his part) draws all unto him, but few be mete for the heau^nly
Philosophye, for the teaching and delivery of the which, he chiefly came into
the world. The people is moved with care of the body, and is desyrouse and
deliteth much in new syghtes and gasinges. But he deliteth not greatly in
such sightes, that seeks after things of perfeccion, and things far a
sondre, from the affeccions of the common sort.

The.v. Chapter.

THerefore, Jesus seeing the people flockyng about him more and more, and that
of all sorts, he conueyeth himself from the low place whither every man
might have access, and goes up unto the hill, and began now to preach
and teach the heavenly Philosophy, declaryng by the highness of the place, that
he would show furthe and teach no common nor mean thing, but all high and
heavenly things, following also the exaumple of Moses, who publyshing the law
unto the people (as we read) went up to the hill. His disciples whom he had
chosen specially unto him, followed him going up, in such wise yet that the
common people were not let to follow him, if any had so much desire and
strength. Therefore Jesus when he came to the top of the hill, sat down, not
as being weary, but purposyng to teach serious and weyghtye things, which
required a diligent hearer. When his disciples perceived that, they compassed
him nere about that none of his holy doctrine should escape them. Jesus
therefore entryng and beginning his godly and wholesome Philosophye, not out of
a tower or tabernacle with a golden seat (such an one as Iarcas the great
Philosopher of India had being garnysshed with precious stones,) not out of the
proud pulpet of the Philosophers, not out of the arrogant chair of the
Phariseis, but out of a seat of grass he casts his iyes, not upon the
commen people, but upon his disciples: and openyng his holy mouth, he began
to show furthe the lessons of the gospel, which hitherto had not been heard,
and which be far from the opinion of all men, that appeared to the very
wise unto the world. All men promise blessedness, which take upon them to be
teachers of wisdom. All men of what estate or condition soever they be,
desire blessedness. But much controuersye has been among Philosop^^rs, and
much error in the life of men* in what things the felicity of man does
consiste: And forasmuch as this is the mark and foundation of all wisdom,
Jesus first does open and set furthe strange sentences, but yet very true.
And therefore through miracles he obtained credit to be given to his saying,
though it seemed sumwhat incredible, so that they that found his power to be
effectual in healyng of diseases of the body, might trust also his doctrine
to be true, whereby he healed the diseases of the mind. Yet few disciples
there were, that did both hear and enbrace this blessedness: Let all men hear,
for he spoke to all, and all shall be made blessed and happy. Blessed (...)
the poor (...) spirit
Of false opinions spryng all sins in living. Therefore above al things, we
must endeavor to pluck them away. And for because that fierceness and
arrogancy is the most daungerouse disease of the mind, which suffers not
manne to receive the true doctrine (yea it is the very fountain from whence
in manier spryng all deadly offenses) Jesus first of all heals this, saying:
Blessed be the poor in spirit, for theyrs is the kingdom of heaven: whose
ears could have abiden so incredyble a saying, but after so many testimonies
of John, of the father, and of the dove, and finally unless his authority had
been set forth, and credit obtained through evident signs and miracles? Many
be made vile, abject, and humble, and be brought in discourage of themselves,
by the reason of pouertye, of baseness of birth, of lowenesse of estate, or of
aduersitye. Truly these be nere to the blessedness of the gospel, if they
follow with their heart, as they be called by their state. But this humility
of spirit, rests in the inward affeccion, not in outward things. But how
shall he have a kingdom, which takes nothing upon him, which gives place to
all, which is offended with himself, which thrusts out no man, which
hurts no man? For he seems more nigh the servitude of an ass, than a
kingdom. This kind of men is trod under the feet every where, is hurt and
harmed without redress, lives like an abiecte without regard, poor and
comfortles. But it is true, that truth says. To these only appertaynethe the
kingdom, but it is the kingdom of heaven. Think thou that these fierce and
violente men do reign? They be very slaves, they be under many tyrannes,
they be vexed with avarice, anger, hatred, desire of vengeance, with ^eare,
with hope. They uneaths live, much less they reygne. But he that is free
from all these vexacions and troubles, and betaketh himself to innocence and
clean life, puttyng his trust in God, lookyng for the reward of the world
to cumme, and is very quiet and regards not the things of this world, but
seeks after heavenly things: has not he a goodlye kingdom, far passing
the kingdoms of worldly kings? Neither filthye lust, nor auaryce, nor
hatred, nor anger, nor other worldly infeccions of the mind, reign over him:
And armed with faith so often as the case requires he gives commandment to
diseases, and they flee away the gives commandment unto the waters, and they
be still: he gives commandment to devils, and they depart. So mighty is the
kingdom of the mind, which dystrustyng himself, puts his trust in God,
and distrustyng the succoure of man, doethe depend wholye of heaven. It is not
the dyademe, it is not the oyntmente, it is not the guard, that makes a
kingdom: But the other before mentioned be the things that make a king in
deed, and bring him finally to the heavenly and everlasting kingdom, where
there shall be no disobedience nor rebellion. A worldly kingdom is gotten by
violence, and defended by fierceness. This kingdom is gotten by modesty and
soberness, and defended and established, by humility and mekenes. The world
judges none meet to govern a kingdom, but such as be of notable spirit,
and of a st^ute courage. But God auaunceth unto his kingdom those chiefly,
which do most humble themselves.

Jesus goes on and joins unto this an other sentence as hard to be believed
and taken. Blessed be the meke, for they shall inherit the earth. And who be
the meke? they that use no man violently nor extremely, and when they have any
harm, they be ready to forgive the iniuryes done unto them: they also that had
rather lose their thing, than to contend or strive for it, and that regard^
more concord and quietness of mind, than large possessions, and such as
rather desire quiet poverty, than troublesome riches. But this kind of men is
oftentimes set beside and put from their goods and lands, and he goes not
about gredely to get other men's, but is rather driven out from the
possessions of his auncetry. But this is a new fashyon of enlargyng of
possessions, for meekness obteyneth more of them that give wyllyngly and of
their own accord, than violence and rauenye can purchase or obtain by right
or wrong. The stout and fierce lord does not possess the thing that he has.
But the meke and quiet man will rather give place and leave his goods, than
contend or strive for them, therefore is his possession in all places whereas
he fyndethe lovers of the evangelical meekness. Stoutnes and stifnes is hated
of all men, softenes and mekenes is favored of the heathen. Finally, if the
meke lose his possession, it is no loss unto him, but great gain and lucre.
He has lost his land, but he reserueth quietness of mind. He has well sold
his land, which has avoided trouble and business, and has kept still
quietness of mind. Finally, if the meke man be put from all that he has, the
more sure and certain is he to possess the land of heaven, out of the which
he can not be thrust. The world lamenteth and counts them unhappy which be
banyshed and driven out of their countreye, but Christ pronounces them
blessed, which be banisshed for the gospel sake. For they be made denisens in
heaven. They be driven out of the liberty of one city, and cast out of
their house, and chased out of one country, but the gospel man has the
whole world for his country. And the godly men be sure of heaven for their
house and their countreye.

Lack of children or parents, and such other as we entierly love, commonly
is counted a miserable thing, insomuche that sum lacking their desires, and
deprived of their affeccions, as of wife, parents, brothers, or children, do
sumtyme kill themselves for sorrow. And for that cause friends use to repair
unto them in such cases, to comfort them, and to mitigate the bitterness of
their sorrow. But blessed be they that mourn for the love of the gospel, which
be plucked away from their wife, children, and other that they love, and see
them that they love most derely, to be punished and slain for the
reghteousnes of the gospel which also despise the pleasures of this world,
and lead their life in weeping, watching, and fasting. With these, the heavenly
spirit will be present, he will be their secret comforter. He will recompense
their temporal waylyng with inestimable hearts joy, and afterward they shall
be translated unto everlasting bliss. Man's comfort entending to heal the
grief, does oftentimes make it worse. But the spirit which is the true
comforter does so inwardly refreshe the mind being clear in conscience and
ascertayned of the rewards of the life to cum, that in most grievous
affliccions of their bodies, they think not themselves unfortunate, but rather
do most joyfully rejoice.

Famyn and hungar by the opinion of al men, is a grieuouse thing, and poverty
is a thing with all endeavor to be avoided, and every man calls them
fortunate and blessed, which do notably increase and establishe their
householde and substance, and have abundantly to use and occupye, but it is
not the riches whorded and heaped up that satisfies the mind: and the
felicitye of man is not to be measured by the fulnce of the belly. What be they
than in this kind of men whom Christ calls blessed? Blessed (says he) be
they which hungar and thyrst for ryghteousnes. The things wherewith the body
is nouryshed and fostred up, ought to be desired but lightly; and yet the
common sort are sore turmoiled with care for them. And sumtime the saturitie
does more vex them that be full, than the hunger did trouble them before:
and by and by after their saturitie, thirst and hunger return again, and
must oftentimes be repaired. And these things be present every where to the
godly, which be content with a little, and desire nothing but necessaries, and
are without al carefulnes, for he does give and mynistre unto them, which
fedeth the sparowes, and does clothe the lillies. Happy be they which do
take this hunger and thurst from bodilye and casual things, and apply them
to the desire of the evangelical justice, where there is evermore that is to
be hungered for, evermore that is to be thyrsted for, and blessed sacietie and
fulness. And this is one part of blessedness, to hunger for that bread of the
mind, whereof whosoever eats he shall live everlastingly, and to thurst for that
lively water whereof who so drynketh, in him there shall spring a well of water,
runnyng into everlasting life.

The common sort supposes them to be blessed, which be helped with other
men's aid, and they rejoice and be glad rather for their sakes that be
helped, than for their cause that help them. But I say: Blessed be the
merciful, who for brotherly charity count an other man's miserye to be
their own, and be sorry for their neighbors hurt, and do bewail their
miseries: and of their own do feed the nedy, and clothe the naked, and
monyshe them that do amysse, and teach the ignorant, and pardon the offender:
Fynallye what soever gift or good thing they have, they bestow it in helpyng
and refreshyng others. And they leese nothing by it, but they gain. For the
merciful and beneficial man* toward his neighbor, shall find God much
more merciful and beneficial toward him. Thou have pardoned thy neighbor of
sum light offense, God will forgive thee all thy sins. Thou haste passed over
for thy neighbors sake a temporal vengeance, God will pardon thee of
everlasting punishment. Thou haste socoured with thy substance thy brothers
pouertye, God will restore unto the his heavenly riches. They that be
merciful wax poor as concerning worldly things, for by geuyng their
richesse are consumed, but toward God they wexe rich: for their worldly
store being consumed, their heart is heaped up with the fruits of godliness.

The common sort of men calls them unhappy that be blind, and because
they have lost their most pleasant sense, they say they be no longer
alive, but that they abide in darkness like dead men. So pleasant a thing it
seems to the iyes to look upon the light, and to behold this goodlye
spectacle and sight of the world. That if it be a thing so much to be
wisshed for to behold the sun with the bodilye ^yes* how much more
pleasant and blessed a thing is it with the iyes of the mind to behold God,
the maker of the sun, and of all things? Ye see how they leap for joy,
which have been blynd^, and now do see the sun again. Yea they rejoice as
much as if they had ^^en delivered from hell. How much more blessed be they,
who being destrusted from blindness of the mind, have the gift inwardly to see
god, the fountain of all ioye^, whom to behold, is high felicity and
blessedness. As the sun is to clear iyes so is God to pure and clean minds?
As matter of skumme or a web is to the iyes, so are sins to the minds.
Therefore blessed be they whose heart is pure and clean from all filthiness. For
they shall have this gift, which is more to be desired than all the pleasures of
the world. They shall see God.

The common sort of men judges them to be blessed which having their things
in good frame and stay, live in rest and quie^nes, and have no man to
trouble them. But after my judgment they be blessed, which after they have,
repressed in their hearts the rebellion and rage of all their foul lusts,
d^^^ study and endeavor to make unity and concord among such as be at
strife and variaunce, not only not revenging themselves if they have been hurt
of any body, but wyllynglye on their own accord, prouokyng them to peace, of
whom they have suffered harm. And if any manne think it hard to be done,
let him harken to the reward. For they shall be called the sons of God. What
is more honorable than this title and praise? Yea what is more blessed? For it
is no vain title. He that is the son, must needs be heir also. But the
vnlykenes of manners declares and argues a bastard. The following of the
fathers steps, declares a true and a natural child. God forgeuyng freely
all offenses, does stir and provoke all men which has offended him, to
peace and amity. He offers himself of his own accord very merciful to
all them that do repent. He will not knoweledge them for his children, which
do not show themself to their brethren, as he has showed himself toward
all. Carnal fathers disherit their sons, which do not agree with their
other brethren. So the heavenly father will abdicate and put away the haters of
peace and causers of discord, from thinheritaunce of heaven.

And because there be many froward and evil men in every place, peace cannot
be stayed and continue with al men, but through sufferaunce of displeasures: It
is the part of g^dly men utterly to endeavor themselves, that they be at debate
with no man, whether they be good or evil, they must move and allure all men
with curtesy, gentilnes and pleasures, as much as may be, to love and concord.
But the frowardnes of sum is such that they will be stirred to anger, yea with
benefits also, and will vex them that do for them, and use cruelnes against
well doers, and count them for their enemies that study to preserve them. If in
this case peace cannot be conserved on both sides, yet blessed be th^^ ^^r the
love they bear to peace: whom the wicked do persecute for none other cause,
but for the ryghteousnes of the gospel, which hurts none but profits all.
For the self same thing provoke their hatred, for the which they ought to
love, and they do injury for none other thing, but for the which they ought to
render thanks. Sum will say: who can love such that for gentylnes requires
hatred and ill doings? It is a great matter I grant, but great is the
reward. And what reward? not a crown of oak or laurel, not a bullock or a
goat, or any such like reward, which worldly men use to give to such as
get the ouerhand in worldly mastryes, but the kingdom of heaven. Ye that be my
dysciples must make you ready to this wrestling, if ye esteem the rewards of
the gospel. Ye must not fear the cruelnes of men. No man can hurt you, if
ye stick stiffly to ryghteousnes. The persecucion of evil men shall not take
away your innocencye, but shall increase your blessedness. In the midde storms
of aduersytye ye shall be blessed, yea when they curse you most bitterlye,
when they shall assault you with all kinds of hurtes, when they shall rebuke
you, and lay at offenses against you, and that falsely, not for your fault,
but for the hatred and displeasure of me, for the sum of the crimes which
they shall lay against you shall be, that ye are christen men. Do not lament
and bewail your selves, as men thrust out, afflicted and beaten, misreported
and infamed, but rather for these things be glad and rejoice, because the more
fierfe they be in persecutyng, so much the more your reward is increased and
heaped up for you in heaven of the heavenly father. God will turn their
naughtynes to your good. He will turn the hurtes that they do, to your
advantage and luc^e. He will turn the ignominy, rebuke, and reproach that
they put you to, into everlasting and true glory. He will turn the crimes and
reprofe which they falslye lay to your charges, into the titles and
commendacions of true godlynes. He will turn their malediccions and curses,
into praise and reioysyng on your parties, not only before God (and yet to
please him it is sufficiently enough, yea though ye displease the whole world)
but also before men. For, to be rebuked of wicked men for godlynes, is a
praise: to be tormented of the haters of God, is to be crowned. Glory is not to
be sought for of men, but glory of her own accord customably does follow
true virtue. Will ye have a ready and plain example? It this day what is more
holy and honorable than the memory of the Prophets? And yet when they were
alive, did the wicked sort persecute them with all kinds of affliccions, as
they shall do you.

They persecuted the Prophets for the hatred of my father: ye shall be
persecuted for the hatred that men bear toward me. These be vehemente
things I grant, and passing man's weakness. But it must needs be an
excellent and a notable thing, which by his might should move and draw the
whole world, being overwhelmed with weryshe opinions, and vain desires. For
which of all these worldly men does not abhor the tormenting of the body?
who is not afraid at the danger of life? Who is not styrred with desire of
auengyng, when he is provoked with sore checkes and rebukes? who can quietelye
suffer his name to be spotted and hindered without any deserte? But to the
intent ye may be blessed, I require more of you, that is, to think your
selves blessed for such evil affliccions: and rather to have pytye of your
blind persecutours, than to be agreued with them: to say well by them that
say evil* by you: to offer them everlasting health, which go about ^ou^
destruction. This high and excellent virtue ye cannot perform, unless ye
cum unto it by the degrees which I showed you before. If ye cast away
utterly the swelling and pride of the mind, if ye put from you the desire of
reuengyng, if ye despise all the pleasures of this world, and embrace the
sharp way, if ye extinguishe the desire of worldly things, and thyrste for
nothing greatly, but for ryghteousnes and godlynes, if ye be full minded to
succoure and help the greefes of al men, and desire to further the commodities
of al me^, if ye have a mind sincere and clean from all vices and filthye
desires, not regardyng any thing, nor delityng in any thing but in God alone:
finally, if ye study and devise with quiet hearts to nouryshe and to make
concord and peace then shall ye perform these things, the which other men
cannot yet attain unto nor once dream upon. But yet they that be curable and
not utterly of a desperate mind, musyng much at your sufferaunce and
godliness, they shall well understand that it is no counterfeyt thing, they
shall well perceive that it is not a thing of man's power, and being moved
through your exaumple, shall be turned to better thrifte.

For I have chose you few, not to the intent I would allure and bring to the
knowledge of the evangelical wisdom, one or two cytyes, but the wholle
world. It must needs be a liuelye and a pithye thing that can be sufficient
to saw^e and savor the life of all mankind, Ye be the salt of the earth.
being so weryshe and unsavory through the desires and fond opinions of vain
things. For I have chosen you, not to the intent ye should be of the mean
and tolerable sort, but that ye should be the salt of the earth: it needs
not to have much salt, but such as is good and strong, that whatsoever it
doethe touch it may season, and of weryshe make sauoury. The yerth is great
and yet the saltnes that it has, it has of a little salt mixte with it. And
ye see that a great deal of meat unsavory and werishe, with a litell salt
sprynkeled upon it, is made sauourye. It must needs be that in great noumbres
of men, many be found but mean, and uneath tolerable. But if the salt be
vnsau^ry. etc,
But in Apostles, in bishops, in doctoures, and teachers, that quick and
perfect liuelines of the evangelical charity, must needs persevere and abide.
Otherwise if your manners be made unsavory with the love of praise, with desire
of riches, with the lust of pleasures, with the gredin^^ of reuengyng, with
the fear of infamye, harms, or death, what remains than, whereby the
unsavory life of the multitude may be seasoned? so it shall cum to pass,
that ye shall not only be unmeet to season others, but also ye youreselues
not perfourming the thing that ye teach, shall cum into extreme contempt of al
men. For what is less to be regarded than unsavory salt, which serves not
for so much as to doung the land, for somuche as if it be cast on the ground
it causes barraines.

By that means men shall have you in veneracion, yea they also which
enuyously and hatefully backed against you, if they once perceive that your
doctrine does savor of the liuelynes of the gospel, if they see all your
life to be agreeable to your doctrine. When ye have once taken upon you this
profession, either ye must be very profitable unto all men, or veraye
unprofitable, either ye must have great praise among men, or great
disprayse. Dispraise and rebuke ought to be shunned more than death, for it
does redounde to the infamye and slander of the gospel. Wherefore se that ye
be on every side sincere pure, and very perfect, to the end that the impuritie
of the multit^d^^^^^ye be corrected through your purity.

Let your life and your doctrine be such, that it may be a guide and a rule
of good life to all men that does behold and look upon it. Ye be the light of
the world.
There is but one sun of this world, but the same is so mighty and
plentiful of light that from a far, it shyneth upon all them that dwell
upon the earth. So I have set you in an high place, that whatsoever ye speak,
whatsoever ye do, must needs be spread abroad thorowout the whole world. If
the clouds cover the ^unne, how shall men have light? If your doctrine be
darkened with errors, if the light of your life be dimmed with worldly
desires, what thing shall drive away the darkness of the multitude? Wherefore ye
must beware, that there be no darkness nor folishnes in you. Ye cannot be
hyd though ye endeavor never so much. A city that is set on a hill can not be
hyd.
Consider well that ye have a part to play in the stage of the whole world,
to thintente that carefulnes should sharpen you to be circumspect and
diligent. A small offense in you, is as much as a great crime. Ye be as a
city set upon an high hill, which may be seen of the way goets far and
wide. It can not be hid though it would, for the hill with his high to^ne
that bears it, wylleth it, ^illeth it, makes it seen of al men that it may
show the way to them that erte and be out of the way. This is the nature of
the evangelical doctrine, it suffers not the professoures of it, to be hyd
and unknown, although they fleing the fame of men seek dens to hide them
in. And why should ye be hid, which is ordained for this purpose, to do good
to al men indifferently? Salt is given to season with, the sun is given to the
world to give light, the city is buylt in the top of the hill, to be seen of
all men. In the night men light a candele in the house, to give light to al
them that be in the house: And therefore they hide it not under a bushel, but
set it upon a candelsticke that the light thereof may the better cum to all,
and the use of one light may extend and reach to many: So ye ought not to
seek, how to purchase a fame and opinion among men: but only be ye rarefull
that ye darken not the light, which I have lyghtned in you, and that ye
persevere and continue upon the candlestick, where I have set you. The salt
cannot but season. The light cannot but shine.

Therefore let your light shine, Let your light so shine before men.
yea rather my light and the light of my father, unto all men, that they
considering your life to be utterly pure and blameles, and very heavenly, may
glorifye your heavenly father, to whom is due al honor and glory. For all
your good works and miracles be they never so wonderful, ye shall challenge
nothing unto your self, but ye shall refer all glory and praise unto him,
from whom cummeth whatsoever men do worthy praise. It shall be your part, to
have none other care, but manfully and faithfully to perform the office
committed unto you. He shall give the reward in time convenient, and that a
great reward, to whose glory ye do service.

When ye hear the new precepts, which neither Moses did deliver nor the
Prophets taught, suppose not that I bring like matter as the pharisees were
wont with their addicions and man's constytucions making the law heavy and
sore, and the very pyth and chief of the law utterly neglecting and
abolishyng. I came not to diminishe and abate the law or abolishe it with new
precepts: But I came rather to fulfill and make perfect the law. For it does
command nothing that any man can complain that I have not observed and
kept. And if the shadows give place when the light cummeth forth, if I
perform in deeds, that which the Prophets said before should cum to
pass, the law is nothing hindered, but rather made perfect. The law had his
time, it had his honor, it did shadow with certain figures, that which
now is represented and open to the world: the law did in manner hedge
about the desires of men, with ceremonies and carnal precepts, as it were
with certain bars, that they should not fall without any stay into every
sin, to thintente they might be the more apt to take the doctrine of the
gospel: but now that that is perfect, is showed forth. The carnal and gross
law was profitable to this intent, that men might acknowledge their sins,
but now grace which washes away sin, is given unto us without ceremonies.
Therefore the law is no more offended, than if the king himself being alive,
should cum in place where is image was painted, and allure all men rather to
look upon him than upon his image: or else if a a weak child in process of
time should grow to be a man, or if the ripe fruit should succeed after
buddes and leaves, or if the sun springyng up should darken the moon and
the stars. What the law promised is now performed, what it did show
before, is now done. What it did shadow is now made open to al men's iyes,
what it endeavored to perform and could not, is now brought to pass at
full. This light is promised unto al men, but yet so that the Jews have no
cause to complain of us. The grace of the gospel is first offered to them,
neither shall they have the less therefore, if that they have be common to many
with them. This is certain, that we break not the law wherein the Phariseis
do glory, in so much that not the least jot, no not one prick of the whole
law shall perish, for there is nothing written in it, but it shall be fulfilled.
It were a folishe thing to look for that hereafter which is now present, it
were a mad thing so to delyght in shadows, that ye should despise the true
things, so to stick to imperfect things, that ye should despise perfect
things, so to embrace carnal things, that ye should looth spiritual things,
so to be given to worldly things, that ye should neglecte heavenly things.

Whosoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments: and teaches
men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven. But whosoever does,
and teaches the same, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I
say unto you, unless your righteousness excede the ryhgteousnes of ye Phariseis,
and Scribes, ye can not enter into the kingdom of heaven Among the Jews he is
not regarded ne counted a good keeper of the law that does omit or let
pass any of those things which the Phariseis have added of their own
prescribing, as washynges of hands, of pottes and vessels, and yet these
addicions and patches profit so little toward the perfeccion of the law, that
they oftetymes withdraw men from the obseruacion of the same. But in ye kingdom
of heaven which is much more perfect, he that breaks but one of these small
precepts which I now add unto the prescripte law of Moses, although he
teach the thing to be ^bserued which he himself thorough weakness and
frayltye does not perform, he shall be counted the least and most
d^spised, in so much that unless he profit and go forward unto better
things, he shall be utterly excluded from the felowshyppe of the gospel. But
whosoever teaches these small things not to be despised, which drive men
far from those things which the law does forbid, and doethe perform
that which he teaches, he is to be had in veneracion, and shall be counted
great in the kingdom of heaven. And yet they that be the chief and the
highest in the Sinagoge despising such things, think it enough if they do
commit none of those things which be punishable by the law, and yet in the
mean season they favor, and flatter, and perdone themselves in the naughtye
desires of the mind. Truly this is the justice of them which by the fear of
pain be refrained from il doing. But they that be moved to things of more
perfeccion by chariti^, and by that heavenly spirit, they wyllynglye withdraw
themselves from the approchyng to ill doings, and they do not only forbear
to hurt any man, but they will no hurt to no man. And that ye may perceive
what difference there is between a Jew and a true Christian man, between
Moses disciple and mine, this I do ascertayne you, if ye do perform
whatsoever the law doethe prescrybe, whatsoever the Phariseis yt be now do
perform, which now be accoumpted and think them selves very ryghteous, and
if ye add nothing of more perfeccion, ye shall be so far of from being great
in this profession, that an entry shall not once be given you into the kingdom
of heaven. For this profession does so far excel, that they that be the
chief there, have not so much as the least place here.

And yet that it may be more evident how much we add unto the Pharisaycall
justice, and that our commandments be not repugnaunt against the precepts
of the law, but rather aid them: we shall make the matter manifest by
certain exaumples. Ye have heard that a commandment was given in times
paste unto the elders: Thou shalt not kill. And if a man do kill, once
convicted and judged, he shall be punished.

Therefore hitherto he thinks himself to have fulfilled the law, which
has slain no man, and so has escaped the threatenynges of the law, this
manne as a just and an innocent manne shall be received into the Sinagogue.
Now harken how much I add hereunto. Who so is angry with his brother etc.
Truly this I ascertayne you, whosoever is angrye with his brother shall be in
danger of judgment. For the dignity of the profession does encrese the
fault, in so much that what homycide is in the old law, the same in the
new law is the vehement mocion of the mind to be revenged. For the first
degree to homycide is to be angrye. For such an one has not yet actually
committed homicide, but now he begins (...) go toward homicide.

Therefore he that wills ill to his brother, even now has committed a
grievous offense before God his judge. And if he do not furthwith repress his
fearce mind, but being overcome with anger, do burste out with sum word
which touches not his brother in deed, with any euydent, and plain reproach,
but makes him sad with a manyfeste token of contempt, as if he should say
Racha, or some otherlyke thing, which declares the ill will of the mind: now
is he (as one nere unto homicide), not only in dau^gier to judgment, and
shall suffer lyghter punishemente, and yet as great as the homicide mentioned
in the old law deserves, but also he is in danger to a counsel, where he
shall be the more grievously condemned. Furthermore if the disobedient mocion of
the mind: does burst out so far that a man strike his brother with a
manifest and a certain rebuke, and calls him fool, or such other like,
now shall he be in danger to that most grievous pain, that is to say, to
the pain of hell fire. So many ways is he punished which is not yet cum unto
homicide and murdre. But he is nere unto homicide, whosoever is fallen from
brotherly charity. Whosoever wylleth ill to his brother in anger, though he
has not plucked out his sword, yet he has strike^ in mind. Whosoever has
rebuked in anger, But whosoever says thou fool. etc.
has stricken with the tongue, and peradventure would have slain but that he
feared punishment. Therefore the law of the ghospel which punishes the angry
man, is not against the precepte of ye law: Thou shall not kyl: but it
drives and puts of a man further from that, that ye law commands to be
punished. He is more safe and farther from murder, that utterly plucketh out
from his heart all anger and hatred, out of the which root springs
homycide and murder. Therefore if thou offer thy gift at the altar, etc.
Therefore whosoever has gotten to himself the charity of the gospel, which
wylleth well to them that wylleth ill, which recompenseth iniurye with well
dooyng, he has little need of the thretenynges of Moses law, for the avoiding
of murder. The vttermoste degree of hatred is to kyl and sleye, and the
vttermoste degree of charity is to will well to the killer and sleyer. Among the
Jews he is counted godly and devout which veryng ill will to his brother,
brings his offering to the altar, where as no sacrifice is accepted unto
God, without brotherly charity, and concord: wherefore chyefly ye must regard
peace and mutual concord. And if any displeasure chance among brethren, as by
ye weakness of man's nature it does happen, al things laid aparte, se that
atonement and concord be made, in so much as if by chance thou make in a
redines any gift to offer unto God, and being now nere at the altar do
remember that thy brother and thou be at square either because he has offended
the, or else because amity is broken through the grief of both parties,
defer not, linger not, but leave thy gift at the altar, make have home, and
bring to pass, that before al things swe^e amity may be restored, and made
up between thee and thy brother. That done, return unto the altar and do
thy sacrifice. So no gift is more acceptable to God, And than come, and offer
thy gift.
than consent and agreement of men. God suffers no damage if his gift be
differred, but much peril and danger hangs over both parts by the breach
of concord. For displeasures prolonged and deferred, ingendre hatred: of
hatred spryngeth homycide and murder. And no service is acceptable unto god
which is not furnished with charity. And if thou will say unto me: I have
offended nothing, let him bow first and make suite that has offended, thou
art not to be heard. He that is commanded to love his enemy, will not stick
to restore and make up love and concord, though it were broken through another
man's defaulte. Forgive the trespass of thine own accord, and ease thy
brother of his heaviness, which did suppose that thou were angry with him: Thou
shall not find God merciful unto the, unless thy neiboure find the
merciful unto him. Thy gift shall obtain no thank ne favor at al before
God, except thou bear perfect favor and love toward thy brother.

If the concord and agreement of men is so highlye esteemed of God, that he will
suffer himself to be defrauded of his, gift now in a redines for him, so
that concord and agremente may be restored and made up, how much more meet
and convenient is it for man, whom this matter specially does touch, Agree
with thine adversary.
to redeem peace and amity with the loss of his substance* But perchance
some may be found so unjust, that wrongfully of his own accord does draw
men into the law, ready to make ru^^elmg and business unless he have his will
and pray of them. And now they being bent of both sides, with burning hearts,
they prepare their accusementes, they run to the judges. You would know of
me: what should I do in this case? Shall I purs^e my right by the law?

If thou will follow my counsel, in the way as thou go with thy adversary,
thou shalt spedely finishe and make an end of the mattier, either with equal
and indifferent conditions, or else with unequal and unjust conditions. End the
matter with him, the condicyons being never so unjust, yet thou shalt have
advantage and gain. There shall be some loss of money: but the thing is
conserved which is most precyouse, that is peace and amytie. The quietness and
tranquillity of the mind is conserved, the which if thou had bought with
all thy whole goods, yet thou had paid but little for it. Thou should
have waited upon the aturneys and the clerks thou shouldeste have run busily
up and down, thou must have sued for the favor of the judges. Thou
shouldeste have done and suffered many things unseemly and vnmee^e for thee.
And where as nothing is more precious than time, considre how much thereof
thou should have spent and lost. Wherefore mark well what great gain and
advantage thou shalt have, if thou fynishe thy suite spedely, seeing the issue
of the law is uncertain. For he that has the better matter has not always
the higher hand, and there is danger lest thy adversary having the upper
hand, deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver the to the common
officer who shall lead the into prison, where if thou be once laid, it is not
now in thy power to fynyshe the matter with thy adversary, and so thou shalt
purchase not only affliccion and punyshement of the body with shame, Thou
shall not cum out thence, etc
but also thou shalt not escape until thou haste paid the whole some every
farthyng which thy adversary did demand, where as thou mighteste have
compouned with him for less, when he was yet more gentel and less angry. So
in making of concord and amity, way not sowrely nor extremely which is more
in fault. Let this only be thy endeavor, yea though thou give over part of
thy right, that concord and amity suffer no damage.

Hitherto we have treated of love and hatred, of the which one is the root of
al euangelical godliness, the other is the pestilence and poison of the same.
But next unto murder is aduoutry, and there is no love more tender and
straight than the love of matrimony. Thou shall not commit aduoutry.
Let us therefore treat of this matter also, what the law has commanded to
your elders, and how much we do add the^eunto. There was nothing more
said unto them in the law, then: Thou shall not commit aduoutry, if thou
dooeste, thou shall be stoned of the people. Therefore hitherto among the Jews
he has been counted holy and perfect, who being content with his own, has
absteyned from an other man's wife. But after the law of the gospel, which I
bring, he does not only commit aduoutry which does defyle another man's
wife, and embraces her body with his, but also he which with unchaste iyes
does behold an other man's wife. For as he that is angry with his brother
is nygh unto mu^^her, Who soever looks on an other man's wife. etc.
so he bends toward aduoutry, whose mind is now unchaste, and whose iyes be
aduoutrous. The husband has not to punish the for aduoutry, but God has for
to condemn thee for aduoutry, before whom he that has willed, has committed
the offense. Therefore as it is in murder to be angry, so is it in aduoutry
to lust: As it is there to say Racha or fool, so is it here to delighte the
iyes, and through the wantonness of them, to entice the mind of another man's
wife to uncleanness. But here a carnal man will say, no man can forbear to lust
and desire in his heart the thing that he loves. But who can love an other
man's wife with his own danger, and with the injury of her husband, which
is so bent in his mind not only to forbear to hurt or to harm him, that is
innocent, but also to require pleasure for displeasure, to them which has
hurt him? perchance he will say, I cannot shut mine iyes. Yea it were better
to pluck out thine iye, than through it to take loss of godlynes. For there
is no part of the body that ought to be so dear unto man, but that it is
better to cut it away, than by the occasion thereof to loose any of the
virtues of the mind. So we must make speed unto the high perfeccion of the
ghospel, that whatsoever does let our journey thitherwarde, we must utterly
cast it away, be it never so sweet, be it never so well beloved. It is a great
lucre and gain to purchase the preciouse margarite of the euangelical charity
by the loss of any thing whatsoever it be. Wherefore if thy right iye be a let
unto the in this behalf, consider not how dear a thing the iye is, but
consider from what a more precyouse thing it does hinder thee: and without
any delay dygge out thine iye that hindered thee, and ^aste it away, and so
make speed as thou dyddest begin. Then that thy whole body should be cast into
hell.
Where the whole man is in danger of his life, it is best to save the rest
of the whole body, by the loss of one part thereof. Thou will say: I shall
live hereafter, an one iyed manne. And what of that? Is it not rather to be
wished to live with one iye, than to dye with both* There is no member more
dear or more necessary for many purposes, than the right hand. Who can this
deny* And yet if it b^ a let unto him that makes speed unto the high
perfeccion* whereof depends the health and the salvation of the whole man, cut
of thy right hand that hinders thee and cast away the burden that thou may
make speed and expedicion thither as thou didste purpose. In this peril and
daungier, it is far better to have the loss of one membre, though it be very
dear, than with the whole body to fall into the distruccion of hell fire. And if
thy right hand hinder the.
If men allow this policy, when there is none other daungier but of the
body, how much more is this to be done, when both the body and solle be in
peril? But these things I have spoken to teach you by a similitude. For I
mean not this that any man should cut of any membre of his body. For the
nature of the members is not ill, but the abuse of them is to be reproved, but
I mean of the members of the mind: for the mind has her noisome members,
and it is a godly thing spedely to cut them of. If a membre of the body be cut
of, beside the pain, this harm cummeth of it, that the part once cut of
can never be restored again. But when the noisome members of the mind be cut
of, as hatred, anger, fleshly lust ambicion, and avarice, the mind is not
maimed, but made more perfect, by reason that the monstruouse and noisome
parts be cut away. And after a short grief of cutting of, follows a
continual pleasure. I will speak more plainly to thentent ye may understand
what I mean. Thaffeccions be the members of the mind. There be some
affeccions which of their own nature lead unto ungodliness, as ire, hatred,
envy, desire of other men's goods. If any of these begin to spring to the
mind, furthwith it must be cut up, for so the ill that begins to spryng*
shall be the more easily and safely taken away. Again there be affeccions of
themself not vttrely ill, but yet by occasion they withdraw sometime from that
that is good, as the love toward our country, thaffeccyon to wife, children,
and parents, or else to kynsfolkes and friends, the care for a good name.
There is no cause why to cut of these members so long as they serve and make
for the perfeccion of the gospel. For my doctrine is not against natural
affeccions, but does restore nature to her purity. But in case thaffeccion
toward thy parent* or wife or children* by occasion does withdraw thee from
the love of the evangelical godlynes, and plucketh thee to worldlines, cut of
that noisome natural affeccion. Like as he that cutteth of noisome thoughts
cutteth not out the heart where they grow but only the naughty desires: so he
that now beholds an other man's wife chastely, like as he looks upon his
sister, or daughter, he has well cast out his noisome iye, and taken for it
the iye of a dove, a clean and a single iye. And he that was woonte to
exercise his hand in robbyng of other, and now does labooure to help the
nedines of other, he has well cut of his ravening right hand: that instead
thereof he might have a beneficial and a liberal hand.

Now go to and let us show an other exaumple. The law of Moses does
suffe^ the husband if he be offended with any fault of his wife, to put her
away after his own devise, so that he give her a writing of divorce, whereby
she may be married to an other, and whereby her former husband may not
lawfully require her again, whom he has cast of.

Wherefore that man has satisfied the law, the which has cast of his wife
for any cause, so that he has given her a writing of dyuorcemente: neither
shall he be taken as an aduouterer, nor no man shall note her as an aduoutresse.
And though the law wishes and desires perpetual amity and concord among
married persons: yet notwithstanding, the same law, knowing the hardness of
the hearts of the Jews, suffered divorce to be used, lest any worse thing
might chance, But I say unto you, y^ whosoever puts away his wife. etc.
that no poysonyng nor murtheryng, should be committed and done. But I will have
Matrimony observed more holily and vndefiledly among them that profess the
new law. For whosoever leaves his wife, but for aduoutry, for than she is
his wife no longer, because she has intermedled with an other man, he
compels her and dryueth her violently to aduoutry. For if she marries
another she marries not an husband, but an aduouterer. And whosoever takes her so
cast of, into marryage, he takes not a wife, but an aduoutresse. The law of
Moses punysheth none of these, but the law of the ghospel does condemn them.
And yet this is not contrary to that. For the law of Moses has given the
husbands liberty to divorce, lest they should be more fierce and cruel to
their wives that they hated, and yet it restrained this liberty by the book
of divorce, both that they should not do it privily, and that they should not
require again, so often as they fantaysed, the wives whom they had cast of
unadvisedly. And the law durst not require more in matrimony because it durst
not command those things that we taught before. For a man endued with the
mekenes of the Gospel, either will soon correct and amend the manners of his
wife, or else he will pacientely bear the same: for when will he seek debate
with his wife, which with his enemies is at peace? When will he seek the
distruccyon of his wife, which is not angry when he is harmed? and when he is
offended, he wills no man ill: Or how shall not he abide his wife, which is
in daily company with him, which suffers his enemy kyllyng him? And if the
purpose of the law be thus, that Matrimony should be holy, and divorces
not commonly granted, we break not the law, but help and sustain it,
which would have no dyuorce except in case of aduoutry, which is contrary to
the nature of Matrymony. For Matrimony was made for this intent that the woman
once appointed to the husband, should bring forth children to him only, and
him only obey. Further she now turns away from her husband, which has
given another man the use of her body. Therefore among Christian spouses let
there not be grievous displeasures and offenses, neither let him nor her seek
any divorce or separacion for light displeasures, but the one must be
reconcyled unto the other if any thing chance through the weakness of men.

Now ye shall hear another thing. Commandment was given unto your elders
none otherwise, but if they had made an oath, they should perform it, and
not be forsworn, for now they are bound to god and not to man only.
Wherefore among the Jews, only perjury is punishable. But he that deceives
his neighbor without any oath made, he is unpunished: but yet the law of the
gospel condemns him, the which, that ye should be the more sure from perjury,
does vttrely condemn al manner of oaths, that it is not leful to swear
neither by god, nor by those things which seem to the common sort to be
things of less religion, that is, neither by heaven, because it is the seat
of god, nor by the earth because it is his footestole, nor by Jerusalem,
because it is the city of the great king, that is to say, of him which has
made al things. Neither as the Heathen swear by the head of another man,
whereof thou have no authority, but it is consecrate to God which has made
all things as he would, for thou canste not make one black hear white, nor
one white hear black. And because all things be consecrate to God the maker,
thou ought to be fearful to swear by any thing. And what needs any oath
among them, where no man, because of their symplicitie can distruste, nor no
man can desire to deceive though they might do it freely, such is their
sincerity and perfectenes, specially in those things, of the which they
declare themselves to be despisers. Therefore among you, plain and simple
speech ought to be more holy and more sure, than the devout and solemn oath
among the Jews. For among you, whose hearts and lips ought to agree, there
is no other use of speech, but to express your minds each to other. In your
bargaynes ye need none oath ye need no execracion or cursing, or such like to
bind the promiser, or to assure him to whom the promise is made. But your
communicacion shall be yea, yea, nai nay.
Two words be sufficient: Nay, and yea, whereby thou denyest that which thou
do not promise, and whereby thou doeste perform that which thou did
promise by plain word, that thou would do. For there is no man less
bound with his simple and bare word, than the Jew swearing by all holy
things: and he whom thou make thy promise unto, does trust thee as well as
if thou had made a solemn oath. If there be any more besides these, it must
needs come of evil and sin. For he that swears, either he thinks ill of
him to whom he swears, or else he that requires the oath does dystruste.
But none of these ought to be in you, whom I would have perfect in all
points. Therefore when I vttrely forbid swearing, I do not abolish the law,
which does prohibit perjury, but I make the law more full, and I withdraw
men farther from that, that the law does punish.

Ye have heard what the law has granted unto our forefathers in revenging of
wrong doings. It says, iye for iye, and toeth for toeth. For it knew tha^
(...) minds were full of revenging. Therefore hitherto it has brydeled the
desire of revenging, that the fault might be recompensed with the like
punishment after the device and discrecion of Judges: and he that had put out
an other man's iye, should loose an iye, and he that had strieken out another
man's toeth, should be punished with the loss of a toeth. For if the
revenging of the injury had been left to the mind of him that was hurt,
oftentimes he should have chanced to have lost his life for stryking out of
a toeth. Therefore the intent of the law was, that vengeance should not go to
far. And I do not abolishe this law, but establishe it. For my doctrine is,
that ye shall in no case revenge injuries, ^e they never so sore, that ye shall
not give taunt for taunt, nor hurt for hurt, nor wrong for wrong: yea if a
man give you a blow upon the cheke, which is counted commonly an intolerable
rebuke, ye shall not requyte it with a blow, but rather offer the other cheke
to be beaten to, and desire rather to suffer a double displeasure, than to
requite the like. And if any man will go to law with thee, to take away thy
coat, strive not with him, but rather even of thy self give him thy gown to.
Again, if any froward person will force thee to go with him the space of a
mile, walk with him two miles, rather then to fall at contencion with him. By
this gentilenes and sufferaunce it shall come to pass, that he which is ready to
hurt, shall not be further provoked, and that thou shall the sooner be
delivered from grief, than if one eiuil should spring of another, and a great
thing made of a small, and many matters of one: And further thou should not
be disquieted in thy mind, and perchance through thy gentilnes, of an enemy
thou should make thee a friend. It is a great matter that ye do enterprise.
Ye must apply your whole study to these things, and little regard those
tryfling things, in getting, and increasing, or in avoiding of the which,
other men do bestow their whole life, unto whom it chances oftentimes that
whiles they hunte for these things, they lose the heavenly goods: And yet
they live not pleasantly here, for they heap up griefs upon griefs unto the^
selves, intangling themselves with sundry striefes and hatreds. Through the
despising of these things, which, when you have them, make you not godly, and
when you have them not, they make you not ungodly, you shall both avoid
hatred, and also obtain you love and good will, and cause your doctrine to be
of more authority and better believed. Therefore if any man does molest t^ee
for a garmente or a vessel, Give to hi^ that asks thee.
or for any other like thing, whereof he is gredy, and would feign have it from
thee, rather than he should go about to do the a displeasure other ways,
grant him his request, and so thou shalt bind him unto thee through thy good
turn, and deliver thy self from molestacion and grief. Again if any man
requires to borow money of thee, let it not grieve the to give it him, yea
though it be so that nothing of it shall return unto thee again, neither of the
usury, nor of the stock it self: for he that lends money to usury does
rather hunt for other men's, than give his own. And why should it grieve the
to lend him though thou shouldeste never have it again, unto whom thou
ought to give freely where thou had plenty and he lacked* So through
your example men shall learn vttrely to neglect these things, for whose sake
they suffer and do al things.

Now harken you to that commandment which is counted chief in the law.
Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy. It requires good will
toward well willers, and them that have deserved well, but it suffers to will
them ill that do hurt us. But I say unto you. etc.
Considre how I do not hinder this precept, but how I add unto it. For I am
not content with mutual benevolence among fre^des, but this I require of you
that be ye folowers of my doctrine, that ye love your enemies, and that ye do
not only not hate them that hate you, but provoke the^ with good turns to love
you. And if they be so far out of frame that they will not use your good
turn, but continually trouble you and provoke you with ill sayings and ill
doings, Do good to them yt hate you.
yet see that ye in the middeste of your troubles, turn not your good mind
from them, but pray unto god for them that they may change their minds and
repent. If ye use this gentilnes toward all men both good and eiuil, ye
shall declare your selves to be the kindly children of the heavenly father,
who desiryng all men to be saved, gives so many fold benefits unto the
worthy and the unworthy. For he suffers his sun indifferently to shine
upon them that wurshyp him, and upon them that despise him, and he suffers
his rain to profit both the just and the unjust, provoking the ill through his
benefit to repent, and styrring the good to render thanks. The likeness of
manners shall bring you to the heavenly father, For he makes his sun. etc
and men will believe that your doctrine cummeth from him, if they epsy in you
his notable goodness. For if ye love them that love you, if ye do for them that
do for you, if ye will well to them which bear you good will, ye have escaped
blame: but ye have not deserved praise. Not to requyte one good turn for
another, is counted a detestable unkindness even among the heathen and the
Publicanes, whose fashion is evil spoken of, even of the common sort. To love
him that loves thee, does perteine unto nature, and not to the virtue of the
ghospel. And if ye show your selves curteyse and gentle in speech toward your
kinsfolks, or country men only, and disdain to salute others, If ye love
them which love you.
as though they were strangers, what great thing do ye? Does not the heathen
men the same? These be common things which do not show men to be good but
that they be men only. And those things cannot seem excellent, which do
chance also unto ill men. Wherefore, I would that ye should be perfect and
resemble your heavenly father with woondreful light of goodness, who being
omnipotent, yet of his goodness does good to al men, loking for reward of no
man. He is meke and gentle toward all men and yet he is hable if he will, out
of hand to punish all men.

The.vi. Chapter.

I Have declared unto you in what things ye ought to pass and exeel the
righteousness of the Scribes and the Phariseis, if ye will be my disciples.
Now shall I show you what ought to be avoided in those things which seem
common, and belonging unto you both. For there is a certain privy poison,
which does infecte all the good deeds of the Phariseis, that they deserve
utterly no praise of God. It is an holy thing to releue the nedy. It is a godly
thing to talk with god by pure prayer. Fasting is a devout thing: And the
phariseis through the setting: forth and bosting of these things, do claim
and obtain an opinion of high holiness before men, whereas they displease god,
who does behold, not ye outward face, but the inward heart. And they do
worthily displease him, because their heart is foully infected with vain glory.
They hunt for vain praise of ye people rather than for a good conscience
before god, and whyleste they catch after a vain reward here, they be
disapoynted of that, which only ought to be desired. This poison creping in
by secret undermining, lies in wait privily also for them, which be sumwhat
entered in the raze of virtue. Wherefore I will in this be^alfe, Take heed that ye
give not alms in y^ sight. etc.
that ye beware and circumspect, that when ye go about to do any godly work,
ye desire not rather to do it openly, than in secret, to the intent ye might be
seen of men, and so hu^t after praise and glory of men. Ye ought always to do
well, whether men se you or se you not. For god does ever behold you, of whom
you look for reward. But if ye go about to get ye praise of man for your good
deeds, ye lose the reward of your heavenly father. Your good work must not
always be kept privy, but ye must not play your pageaunt in the sight of
men, like as players in the stage do play their play, whose desire is nothing
else, but to please the iyes and the ears of the people. But he can not always
follow the best, which does apply himself to the judgment of the common
sort: For ye must please men in such sort, that ye may allure the^ to your
manners and fashions, and not you to go out of kind and fall to them. Though
praise be fled and shunned, yet it follows virtue, of her own accord. And
that sikerly is true praise, which does chance without ambiciouse seking
for. And the whole glory that ryseth of well doing, must be wholly given to god.
Ye shall displease him as soon as ye stand in your own conceit and please
your selves, chalenging unto your selves that which is wholly of his
bounteousnes.

Therefore whosoever thou art that will follow the law of the gospel, when
thou entendest through thy liberality, to releue the nedines of the pore: do
not as Hipocrites be wont to do, which be men like players counterfeted and
disguised, which when they appear liberal and merciful, in heart they be
both covetous and cruel. For the misery of their neighbors moves the^
nothing, but being desirous of glory and renoume, they bye with a little money,
the praise of the people, and would give vttrely nothing if they were alone, and
saw their brother welnere dead for hunger. Therefore as often as they give any
thing to the poor, they seek not to be secret and alone, but they come abroad
in the streets and where as men resort. Let not test pets blow before thee
And like as players should play the^^ pageau^te, they call forth a number of
the people with the sound of the trumpe to toote and to gase, both casting the
poor^ and miserable in the teeth with their miserye, and hunting for themselves
a vain and a folish praise of men. Will ye hear what they gain? Let the
people praise them never so much, they have lost their reward of their good
deed at gods hand, which does measure the godly work of the sincere
affeccion of the mind. He that gives for praise and glory, he sells his
good turn, he gives it not. Truly thou must be so far from the affeccion of
these men, that when thou geueste any alms, thy leftehande must not know what
thy righthande does, and thou must not desire to be looked upon of man, yea and
if it were possible, thou thy self should not know that which thou do
arighte, and should forget thine own deed, and not impate it to any man,
that thou have done well, nor stand not in thine own conceit, And thy father
which sees in secret.
because thou have given thine alms, but only rejoice inwardly, that the poor
and nedy is refreshed. What if men know not, yea what if he that is succored
knows not him that succoureth him? It is enough for thee to have a witness of
the father, from whose iyes nothing can be hid. He will reward thee although
thou have no thank at all of man.

Semblably when ye make your prayers to god, do not follow the guise and usage
of Hipocrites, whose special delight is to stand in company of men, and in the
corners of the streets, so often as they pray, for none other intent but to be
seen of men, at whose hands they hunt and look for the praise of devout and
holy conversation. Let them please themself and others also with such
glorious prayers. This I assure you, now they have their reward, which they
looked for. And what is more vain then this reward? and for a counterfeit and
a false glory they frustrate and set themselves beside that blessed reward,
They have their reward.
which god would have given, if they had offered in his sight, the pure and
sincere oblacion of their prayers. Do thou therefore contrary wise. When thou
prayest, forsake the multitude, enter into thy secret chamber, and shut the
doors, and in secret vttre thy sincere prayers before thy father. It is enough
that he does behold and see thy godlynes, from whom nothing can be hid. He
will render unto thee ye everlasting reward. These things have I setfurth, to
teach you by plain and homely exaumples. For it is not ill to give alms
sumtime before men, or to pray in a multitude, and where as men resort, but
than knows not the left hand what the right hand does, when the work of
charity is not defiled with any affeccion of worldly vanity. Then thou art
secret in thy chaumbre* when thou speakeste unto god with such perfect
clerenes of mind, as though no man did behold thee. He that prays in a
multitude of men as earnestely, yea peradventure more vehementely than if he
were alone, he prays in his secret chaumbre. For the right hand and the
left, or the secret chamber, stands not in the things, but in the
affeccions and desires of the har^e.

This also must be considered in prayer. It is the affeccion and the hearty
desire that moves god, not the noise of the lips. And it skilleth not how
long and how loud the prayer be, but how fervent and sincere the affeccion
and desire is. Wherefore let the example of the heathen men, be far from you,
which do recite, and say long prayers, and full of many words, ready framed, and
prescribed unto them, as who would say, they should obtain nothing except
they weried God with bablyng of many words, repetyng one thing oftentimes,
and prescribing and appoynting with recital of many words, what, when, and
how they would have the thing performed, which they pray for. And yet
oftentimes they pray for things noisome and hurtefull. We ought to ask of God
the best things, and not all things: and we ought to pray often, rather than
much, and vehemently rather than long: finally with the heart rather then with
voice: Neither always with prescrybed and purposed words after the custom
of the heathen, but so much as the feruencie of the mind, and rauishment
toward god, does stir and provoke. Truly your father loves to be called
upon, but not to be taught with long prayer what your necessity does require,
but to be provoked through your godliness to give the thing, which the
slothful and sluggishe deserves not to (...) for he knows what your
necessity does require, yea before that he be called upon.

Therefore be ye unlike to the heathen men, both in life and also in manner of
praying. And if ye will have a form and manner of the evangelical prayer
prescrybed and set forth unto you, this is the worthy prayer, wherewith the
true and natural children joined with brotherly charity, may speak unto the
heavenly father: father unto all men indifferently: of whom although ye have
all things yet those chiefly ought to be required which make for the
attaynemente of the everlasting life. For all the other things he will cast
unto you, even of his own accord, as an increase and advantage, according to
the desires of his children, as he is a most bounteful father.

Whose glory ye ought to regard above al things, to whom al glory is due in
heaven and in earth. To perteine unto his kingdom is to conquer the tyranny
of the devil. To be subject unto his will is to rule and reygne. Of whose
free liberality it cummeth, whatsoever does norishe and revive men's hearts to
the perfeccion of the gospel.

But he will not hear you unless ye accord and agree in one: and concord
and agreement cannot lightly be, unless ye forgive ^che others offenses, without
which men do not live in this wo^lde, although they endeavor toward that
taynement of perfeccion. And through this concord ye shall be safe by the aid
of your father aga^nste the froward temptoure, if ye watch well, and busily
call for the help of your good father, against that naughty one. Wherefore in
vain calls he upon the father with this form of prayer that I teach,
which is not of this sort, which neither fears, nor lou^^^ God, which
lives to himself, which follows his own glory more than gods, which
gape^h for worldely goods and authorytie, which had rather have things
pleasant to his own appetite, than things pleasant unto God, which sueth
after earthely things more than heavenly, which sets less by the
qualities of the mind, than bodily commodities, which is at varyaunce with
his brother, which through riot and dyspleasures uses himself sluggishe
against the assaults of the deiuil. And the manner of prayer is after this
sort. Our father which haste regenerate us to heaven, who were once
vnluckiely borne of Ada^, Our father which art in heaven, etc
and prepared for us (forsaking earthely things) a kingdom and inheritance
everlasting, which art said to be in heaven because thou do replenish all,
and have no manner of dross or earthly infirmity: grant that thy name may be
honorable and gloryouse among men through us, which by thy benefit, be
perfect and pure For it is not our glory but thy gift, whatsoever is well done
of us. Let the tyranny of Satan be abolished, that thy kingdom daily may
prevail more and more, which does not stand in riches or worldely
strength, but in mildenes, chastity, softenes, sufferance faith, and charity:
that vices and ill desires once chased away, thy heavenly virtues may florysh,
and show themselves amongst men, and that it may come to pass at length,
that like as in heaven all things be pec^able and quiet, and all creatures
there do obey most humbly thy commandments: so likewise there be none in
earth which be not obedyent to thy most ^^ly will, Give us this day. etc
every man as far fur^h as the weakness of nature does suffer, diligently
recording now that which shall come to pass perfectly in the life to come. O
father nourish that thou have brought forth, see unto us, that the bread of thy
heavenly doctrine do not fail us, that we may be daily stayed, grow up, and
made luslie by the taking thereof, to the obseruacion and keeping of thy
commandments. And alienate not thy mind away from us being offended with
our trespasses, but for thy clemency and mekenes pardon our offenses which we
commit through infirmity and weakness, that we may have peace with thee, like
as we among our selves forgeuing each other, if one has offended an other,
conserve mutual concord and amity.

Thou being merciful, we fear nothing, and being underset with concord, we be
made stronger against our common enemy. Unto whom we beseech thee (if it be
possible) deliver us not to be tempted. For we know his malice, we know his
frowardnes and craftines. And if thou suffer us to fall into te^ptacion, to
the intent to try the constancy of our mind, o thou merciful father, deliver
us from that naughty civil. Uouchesafe of thy goodness, to grant and make sure
these our desires. See therefore how many things this short prayer does
comprise, that needs he must be perfect whosoever does rightly pronounce this
prayer, that is, who so does pronounce it with mouth that the heart and
affeccion agree unto the same. First it teaches you to depend wholly upon none
other but the heavenly father, to whom ye owe that ye be made, to whom ye owe
that ye be redeemed from sin, to whom ye owe whatsoever virtues ye have* He
is called father, that ye may understand he is full of mercy and
bounteousnes: he is said to dwell in heaven, that ye should lift up your
hearts thither, despising yearthly goods. Ye call him youres, that no man
should v^^dicate any thing propre unto himself, seeing that whatsoever they
have cummeth unto all men of his only liberality. And in this behalf there
is an equality of kings and servants. Ye wish only his glory, that no man
in the earth a^^ribe unto himself, praise of any thing, whereof arises
insolency and stoutnes of mind. Ye wish that he should reign, that he should
be obeyed and not you. For the virtues be his which do work by you. It is his
doctrine which ye shall deliver unto men from me. And it is not enough to
persist and abide in his virtues, but ye must daily increase and go forewarde
in goodness, and for this ye ask of him, that woondrefull bread which his will
is that it should be daily asked, because he does daily give it, and he
wills it to be asked of him, to put you in remembrance that all good things
come from him. Finally that ye should be the more ware to fall from the
charity of so bounteouse a father, he does monyshe you of that froward
Satan, which never ceasseth to lie in watch for the godly, to pluck them
back into his tyranny.

will your father forgive you your trespasses. Wherefore, before ye speak unto
your father with this prayer, considre with your selves, whether ye desire
truly the thing that ye ask, and whether ye be mete persons to be heard of
your father in such things as ye pray for. But chiefly this ye must duly
search with your selves, whether ye have ami^^^ and concord with your
neighbors. Even such a father shall ye find him toward you, as your
neighbor finds you toward him. He will not know him for his son,
which does not agree with his brother. If ye forgive them that offend you,
your heavenly father will forgive all that ye trespass against him. But if ye
will be hard and sore against other men, your father will not forgive you
your offenses. Will thou not forgive thy fellow servant, whom on thy behalf
at one time or at other thou have offended again, and requirest thou of God
forgeuenes of thy trespass, whom thou art hable by no means to recompense
with forgeuyng again his offense made to thee?

Now ye perceive what difference ought to be between your alms and the
alms of the phariseis, and between your prayers and their prayers. Now
harken what difference ought to be between your fastes and theyrs, if ye will
have them acceptable to the father, and profitable to your selves. It is not
the forbearing of the meat that commends fasting unto god, but the pure and
clean affeccion of the mind, fervently desiring to please god only.
Wherefore as often as godlynes shall provoke you to fast, follow not certain
men which be not fasters, but counterfeyters of fasting, setting forth the
color and cloak of fasting with a sower countenance, not intending that in
deed, wherefore fasting should be used, that is to say, either to pacyfie god,
or to chastise the body, whereby the mind might be the more free and ready to
apply and ensue holy things: but by this color they hunt for vain praise of
men, for whose sake despising god, they play this pagent. For to this purpose
they disfigure their faces with palenes and sowernes, that by the behavior of
their body, men may see that they do fast. This is certain: There is no
cause why they should look after any reward of God for these good deeds: For
now they have their reward: attayning that which they hunted for with their
fasting. But so often as thou do fast, appear rather not to fast, and
appear to be merry, anointing thy head and washing thy face, lest men
perceive that thou do fast. And think not that fast to be unprofitable,
which is hid from men. It suffiseth to thee, that thy father sees it, from
whom nothing is hid. And he that sees in secret, in the stead of vain
praise of me^, will reward thee with the perfect reward. Again, I say not
this that it should be wicked that men should know of thy fasting, but that
thy mind should abhor from the desire of vain praise. Than no man sees
thy fasting, when thou do fast not to the intent to be scene of any man. Than
only god does see thy fasting, when thou do fast with this intent, that thou
would as gladly fast though no man should see thee when thou do fast.

The common sort of men not considering these things, whiles they hunt for
small and visible rewards of men, be disapoincted of the invisible and true
reward, which for well doing God does give aboundauntly. In li^^ ease be they
which with much thought and care, do gather together and heap up riches, and
hide them in the ground for losing, albeit this is even to lose them in deed.
He that deals and bestows his riches rightly, it is he that lays them up
surely. For that that thou hidest in the ground, is not profitable unto thee,
but is in daungier of mothes, rust, and thieves, so that thou have nothing of
them, but a miserable carefulnes to get them and to keep them. These things
must be gotten neither carefully nor vnmeasurably. And when they be gotten or
come by chance, they must be redily distributed if any have need, or else so
bestowed, that necessity of nature may be helped, and not riot maynteyned, nor
any disease of the mind be served and satisfied. And yet all men for the
most part unto this thing apply their whole study and care, as though
poverty made men miserable, and riches endued them with felicity. And whiles
they follow after these false goods, which will shortly forsake their
masters, they forake the eternal goods, which indue them with true
felicity, and can not be taken away. But ye of the other side, hasting with
all endeavor to the best and most perfect things, whereby ye shall be rich in
deed, lay up your treasures in heaven, the keeping of the which, can not
trouble you with cumberous carefulnes.

For neither ruste nor mothe does destroy such manner of riches, nor thieves
does not dig it up nor steal it, of which chances, worldely goods be in
danger. If ye lay up these goods with your father, he will keep them safely
for you, and your mind shall not stick grouelyng on the ground being
oppressed with these filthy cares, but it shall despise these vile and fading
things, and be ravished up unto heavenly things, for where as a man's
treasour is, which he loves entierely, there is his heart also. Therefore they
have no high nor heavenly thought, which has gathered riches and hid the^ in
the ground. They walk and wander hither and thither, but their heart is in the
hole where the money is hid. And if the mind be corrupt, either by the disease
of vain glory or avarice, whatsoever is done, must needs be vicyouse.

For first it is to be considered, what is chiefly to be desired, and whereby
we may obtain that which we do ask: furthermore as the candel is in the
house as the iye is in the body, so is the mind in man. If the light of the
mind be not faulty through the darkness of false opinions, and ill desires,
if the iye of the mind deeth look none other way, than to the true mark,
whatsoever is done throughout all the life is acceptable unto God, and every
thing helps toward the heap of felicity. Like as if there be a great
candel in the house, there is no stumbling nor falling: so if thine iye be
clear and whole, it gives sight to all the members, and no part stumbleth or
wandreth, the iye being the captain and guide. Again if the iye of the body
be faulty, no membre does his duty well. For there is no right judgment
when that part of ours is faulty by ye which only we do judge. Therefore if
that part of thee which is given thee for light, be turned into darkness, how
great shall the darkness of the other parts be, which have no light of
themselves? If reason be blinded with desires, and judges that to be good
which is miserable* and judges that chie^^^ ^^ be desired, which is to be
despised or not to be regarded, into what darkness shall men be drawn through
ambicion, filthy lust avarice, folishenes, anger, envy, hatred, and other
perturbacions and troubles of the mind, which of their own nature be full of
darkness? Therefore let your iye be clean and sincere, that it may behold
the best, and let it behold and look upon the best things, either only or
chiefly.

Think not those men worthy to be heard, which divide themselves between
God and men, between yerthe and heaven, and so follow things eternal, that
they will not despise things temporal. For they do nothing else, but where as
they would catch both, they obtain neither of both. This heavenly
Philosophy like as it does promise great rewards: so it does require the
whole man.

And among men a man shall not find two of such ge^til co^dicions yt one
servant can be hable to please both. So it cu^meth to pass, that the one must
be forsaken or else neither can be satisfied. And if the masters be of contrary
appetites and do square within themselves by some grievous debate, it must needs
be that the servant if he will please the one, must not only forsake the other,
but also stick unto the one, and hate the other, whom he has forsaken. And
if he will go from this again unto the other, he must needs translate and turn
his love and service unto him only, and despise the other whom he has
forsaken. And who be so contrary one to an other, Ye can not serve God and
ma^mo^.
as God and Mammon? how can one (...) two, when they command so diverse
things? God commands thee to give of that thou have to the neady. Mammon
commands the to take away other men's by right and by wrong. God commands
the to provide for thy brother which is in danger. Mammon commands the to
live to thyself. God commands sobrenes, Mammon teaches excess and riot.
Wherefore ye flatter your selves in vain, if ye believe that that thing may be
done, which is impossible, that is, to serve both God and Mammon. His
servant is each man to whom he is wholly given. Ye see how riches do^e
possess them full and whole, which do travail for it with so great tumult and
business, which defend them and keep them with so great carefulnes, which
forgo the^ with so great grief: for these they suffer all things, for these
they do all things. Whosoever has bound himself to this service, can not be
the servant of god: he requires the whole manne and cannot abide the
feloweship of so foul and filthy a master, nor can not abide a dimy servant,
which is partaker with his adversary. But the common sort of rich men are
wont to excuse the sore of avarice, by the pretense of man's necessity. They
say by these things men provide for against hunger and nakedness* So speak
they which do not depend wholly of god, but put their trust in their own
defense and aid. My will is ye should be void from this carefulnes, lest it
withdraw you from the desire of better things. The necessity of nature is
content with very little, and every where it is to be had, that may suffice for
such, as I will my servants to be. For either (...) liberality of good men
always ready shall suffice, or else diligence and labor shall provide that
thing which may ease necessity. What ye shall eat or drink, etc.
Finally if none of these help, the father will not, forsake those that be his:
for he that gives the greater things, will cast the smaller things to them,
which with all their hearts desire after heavenly things, although they be
not careful for the world. Therefore lay not up nor hoorde not for a long
time, be not vexed with carefulnes of meat without which ye cannot live,
neither with carefulnes of apparel that covers your body, and keeps you
from cold. Is not the life more precious than meat? Is not the body more
precious than the garment? He that has given these better things, and has
given them to such as were not careful, shall it grieve him to nourishe and
preserve that which he has given with these things of less valewe and
estimacion? If ye desire an exaumple, look upon other living things, which
the maker of all things has made for your sake. Has he not provided a
living for all things that he has made? Consider the birds of the air: they
sow not, they reap not, they lay not up in barnes, careful for time to come,
they live from day to day without all carefulnes: whatsoever they get, they
take it joyfully, and yet the heavenly father gives meat unto them all. And
will he disapoynte you whom he estemeth far above the birds? And if he be
careful over you (as he is in deed) is not your carefulnes in vain? If he
forsake you, what shall your carefulnes prevail? As he has given a body
after his own devise, so will he give a living after his own devise.

Will ye se how unprofitable ye carefulnes of the mind is about such things?
What man is there (be he never so careful) that can add one cubite to the
stature of his body? But every man's body though he think nothing upon it
grows with certain increase unto a quantity appointed of god. If thou cast
away all care, thy body shall be nothing the shorter. If thou be vexed with care
thy body shall be nothing the higher. Therefore he that makes the body big
and strong without thy carfulness, he will provide living for thee without
thy carefulnes, who does withdraw thee from care of those things which be
not gotten without our diligence. It is great folishnes therefore to fear lest
ye should lack food, for as much as ye see that birds be provided for
sufficiently. And now lest ye should be careful for provision of apparel for
the body, consider the lil^es which do spring and grow in the fields
without the care of any man. They labor not, nor spinne not, and who does
provide them of apparel, No not Solomon in all his royalty etc.
as seems good to him, who but the heavenly father? And he does so provide,
that neither Solomon the notable rich and gay king was ever so apparelled,
when he chiefly did ^et forth the glory of his riches, as one of these poor
lilies, smally regarded and set by, which grow not only in gardens, where man
bestows some labor and diligence, but grow also in meadows of their own
accord. For the labor and care of man can make nothing so elegant and fit as
the providence of nature. And if the heavenly father does ga(...) and clothe so
freshely the vile gras^e, which shortly shall perish, and to day is fresh in
the fields, and to morrow cut down, and dried and cast into the furnes: why
have ye so little trust in him, since he has given you things of greater
excellency, and since he has made you to be immortal, and since also he has
specially prepared you for the glory of his name, that ye will think that ye
shall lack apparel, which ye ought to seek for and prepare, not for adourning
and gayness, but for necessity and nedefulnes?

Therefore ye that have god to your father so benignely providing for the
birds, providing for flowers and grass, of the which the one lacks reason,
the other has no feling: since ye se and perceive that he tendreth and makes
so much of you, enduing your body, which is made with merueylous providence,
with a soul reasonable, and like unto the angelical minds, not disdaining
that ye should be called his children: chosing you out from among all men
through his free charity, by whose pure life and sincere doctrine he might be
known and glorified through out all mankind, who^ he has appointed to
thinheritau^ce of the everlasting life: Cast away this carefulnes of vile and
filthy things, and say not doubtfully and fearfully, what shall we eat?
what shall we drink? or what shall we put on? These be the sayings of ye
heathen and not of Christen men, for they either believe not that god is, or else
believe not that he is careful over men. Neither have they learned that there
is any other better life, to set their mind and care upon. Therefore
distrustyng gods help and (...) man's felicity in things of the body,
they prepare with much carefulnes those things, that do perteyne to their
living and apparel, or other commodity of the body. They leap for joy when
these things chance unto them, they sound for fear, when these things be
in danger: They be vexed with sorowfulnes, and sumtyme hang themselfes, when
these things be taken away. And thus through carefulnes cleauyng unto these
corruptible things, they neither live pleasauntly here, nor can lift up their
hearts unto the study and desire of heavenly things. Among men, who is so
wicked a father, that will not provide for his children things necessary for
the sustentacion of their life? Ye have a father so rich, so bountefull, so
circumspecte, that he is sufficient for all, to enriche all, and leave nothing
unprovided for, be it never so little or vile. And fear ye that he will not
provide for his children these things, without the which they cannot live?
Lay this carefulnes upon him, he knows well that ye have need of all these
things. And he is not so hard that he will withdraw things necessary from
such as be occupied in his business. But sum will say: what then? Shall we not
get us with our handye work whereby we may norishe our selves, our wife
and our children? where by we may ease the poverty of the poor? Yes truly,
but without all carefullnes.

For truly the common people does double their misery, both laboring with
the body, and being also careful in the mind. They sow, being careful lest
that which they sow should not cum up, they mo^e being care^^^ lest the
warrier or the these should take away that which is cut down before it be
laid up in the ba^^e, they lay up in their graner, being careful lest any
infeccion should hurt their corn, or lest any fire should rise and destroy
it. Finally because they have aniye to plenty, and not to the present
necessity, they heap up for a long time, and they never have enough as
thought they were sure to live long. Wherefore if the matter so requires, ye
must labor, but without al carefulnes. If ye chance to have money without
fraud, and much busynes, take it* but in such wise, that the carefulnes
thereof, wythdrawe you nothing from the busynes of the gospel. S^he ye first
the kingdom of god. etc
For your matters are greater than that the carefulnes of light, triefleyng,
and corruptible things should withdraw you from them. Let your chief care be
about that* good thing* in comparison of the which, these worldly things be
of no value nor reputacion. The kingdom of God must be set up, that is to
say, the doctrine of the gospel, by the which we attain unto the heavenly
inheritance. Whereof I have chosen you to be the preachers and setters forth,
and have showed you what excellent virtues be nedeful to the doing of this
thing* that is both to love your enemies, and to wyshe well unto them, who
seeks your destruccio^. These things because they be chief and highest,
which come not unto you from your father without your diligence and
carefulnes, ye must first and chiefly seek for them. The other smaller things
which pertayne unto the necessity of this life, the good and gracious father
will cas^e unto you as an augmentacion, and that of his own accord, without
any carefulnes on your behalf, that for both causes ye should render thanks
unto his bountifulnes, both because he has given you those high and these
things, you endeuoryng unto the same: and also because he has cast unto you
these things, without any carefulnes on your behalf. He will not have you
grieved with cares, which (...) more troubled, but not the better. And this
business that ye take in hand, Be ye not careful for to morrow.
is so great and weighty, that it requires ye whole mind, ry^ and voyded from
all cares. Wherefore as men that lives from day, to day, being content with
things present and at hand, be not grieved nor vexed with carefulnes of
things to cum, like as the common sort of men does, doubling their
affliccion, both doing what they can to provide for the present necessity, and
troubling themselves with fear of things to cum. Whatsoever this day
offers unto you, receive it we thanks giving. Let the morrow care for it self
whatsoever it brings. If it bring any good, ye shall not hang in hope: If it
bring any ill, ye shall not prevent your trouble, with fear of ill to cum.
This life has his affliccions, which it needs not to double with fear. For
it is enough to suffer them, when they cum: so that it is not nedeful for
fear to make them present before they cumme. Time does alter and bring these
things in man's life, mynglyng joy with sorrow, and yet all shall turn you
unto good, if ye take well in worth whatsoever shall chance, and set your
care wholly upon the heavenly kingdom.

The.vii. Chapter.

THere is an other thing also, wherein I would ye should be far from the
manners of the Scrybes and Phariseis. For they pardon themselves in great and
greuouse sins, but agaynst^ their brother being an offender, they be most
unmercifully judges, yea falsely reprouyng things that be well, sinistrally
expoundyng things that be doutfull, making very much of things that be light
and small: Finally if they see a man fall into any greuouse crime, they
endeavor more to destroy him, than to heal and save him. And yet hereof they
seek for a name of ryghteousnes, because they be very ^lowt and sore against
other men's faults, whereas they do it neither for the love of their
neighbors, (whom they desire rather to be destroyed than corrected, and to
be slanndered openly, Judge not that ye be not judged.
rather than amended,) neither for the hatred of vice, whereas they maintain
and pardon their own vices far greater than the others. But the judgments
that ye have, must savor of the eua^gelicall charity, which redily does
forgive, which misdeme^he no man rashely without caus^, which does expound
every doubtefull thing to the best, which does gently tolerate and suffer many
things, which desires rather to heal than to punish which consyderyng her
own infirmity and weakness, so judges other men's offenses, as she would
be judged offendyng her self. Finally she takes not upon her an high
countenance in chiding and checking other men's faults, if she find her
self gyltye in like or in greater. First she becummeth her own judge, before
she blames or monishe^h other. And in the mean season it chances to those
high minded men, that the example of an vntusi judgment, lights upon the
judges themselves, and they find other like judges over their life, as they
were over others. Judge not ye therefore after such forte, lest ye be judged
in like manner of others. For else it shall cumme to pass, that as ye judge
other men, so other men shall judge you. And as ye measure to other men, so
other men shall measure to you. For like as a good turn provoke a good
turn, and mercifulnes provoke mercifulnes, so reprofe provoke reprofe, and
cruelnes provoke cruelnes. He that speaks ill by his neighbor, shall be
as ill spoken by.

For no men be so sore against the light offenses of their neighbor, as they
that swarm with much greater vices. One sla^dereth his brother because he
wears a looce garmente, where he himself is full of envy. An other speaks
evil of his brother, because being overcome with weakens of the flesh he
uses a concubyne, where as he himself is wholly the servant of avarice and
ambicion. An other abhors his brother because he is a great bibber, whereas
he himself has in his heart a number of murders and sorceries, being so
blind that he can not see his own bunches, and yette can spy a little warte
in his neighbor. What a wrong and waiwarde judgment is this? Every man
ought to be a sharp judge in his own faults, and more mild in other men's.
Every man ought to look narrowly to his own faults and not to be over busy in
other men's. And every man ought first to be his own physician, before he
lay hands on an other man.

Why doeste thou see a mote in thy brothers iye, and canste not see a block in
thine own iye? or with what face doeste thou say to thy brother: Let me
take a mote out of thine iye, Thou hipocrite first cast out, and^
where as thou carrieste a block in thine own iyes? Thou hypocryte which
doeste hunte for praise of holiness among men, not of thine own goodness, but
of other men's ^uylies, first cast the block out of thine own iye, and
than look with thy pure and clean iye, whether there by anymore which thou
may cast out of thy brothers iye. Like as with the iye we judge the things
of the body: so with the mind, we judge the things of the mind. Therefore
that must be fault^es, wherewith we judge another man's fault. And he must
first teach himself, which takes upon him to teach others: and he must be
his own judge, which entendeth to give sentence of other: and he must
mo^yshe him self, which goethe about to monishe others.

And these things perteyne chiefly unto them, which take cure and charge of
the people. And although I would ye should be prompte and ready to do all men
good, and to suffer them that do you wrong, and to be mylde, gentle, and
indifferent toward them that fall by man's infirmity and weakness: Finally
to be such toward them which be perverse and froward, that ye had rather
to amend them* then to distroye them: yet I would not that the mysteries of
the evangelical wisdom, should be uttered and declared indifferently to the
worthy and unworthy.

And cast not your pearls before swine.
For if the Jews do so esteem their mysteries and holy things, that they
keep them from the dogs, which is a fylthy cattle: If rich men so regard
their preciouse pearls, that they will not cast them to the hogs like mad
men: ye which have in possession the holy things in deed, which do pass
all preciouse pearls, be they never so high of price, beware that ye cast
not the riches and treasure of the gospel unto such as be unworthy. For
they be dogs, which being wholly given to profane and worldly things,
abhor those things that sauoure of holiness. They be swyne, which being
wholly drowned in fylthy pleasures, do deteste the pure and chaste doctrine of
the gospel. Rotten karcases and filthy vometynge is more pleasant unto
dogs, than all sawse and sweet spices.

The swyne had rather have mire, than preciouse stones. Therefore whosoever
does openly despise wholesome doctrine, being without all hope of any good
fruit: ye ought not to put into them the secrets of the heavenly doctrine,
lest by occasion they may be provoked to be worse than ever they were before:
and lest the same chance by them, which should happen if a man should cast
margarites to swyne, or holy things to dogs. For dogs will not only
vn^euerently use the holy thing, but also being provoked, if they be cast at,
will run upon you, and tear you with their teeth. And the swyne will tread
with their feet the preciouse stones like rubbell and rubbishe. So the dog
is not the holyer for the holy thing, but does profane and defyle the holy
thing: and the swyne is not the trymmer for the preciouse stones, but does
defyle the pureness of them. Likewise men of desperate malice, do skorne the
holy doctrine as a folishe thing, when they know it, and do falsely reprove it
as a wicked thing: and do trouble and put the^ to busynes, which do
teach it. Wherefore the wisdom of the gospel must be communicated and
delivered unto the^, that be desirous of it, or at the least to such as be
curable. All things must not furthwith be committed to all men, but as every
man weweth a proof of his towardnes and profiting: so certain secrets must be
opened unto him.

Ask and it shall be given you, etc*
These excellent iewelles like as ye ought not to communicate the^ to all men:
(...) they cum not from God the father to such as be sluggishe and ydell. He
gives these things, but unto such as gredely crave the^: he denies not
these things to them that seek them diligently: he restreigneth not from this
treasure, them that knock importunatly. Ask therefore of the father not ge^mes
or gold, but these true and inestimable riches of the mind: ask I say, and
ye shall have your asking. Seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened
unto you. Your father is rich and bountiful, he denies none, he enuieth none
his riches, but he will have their price and value known. But he does not
know the price of the^, which desires fayntly. Therefore whosoever does ask as
he ought, he receives: whosoever seeks gredely, he fyndeth: whosoever knocks at the
door instantly, to him it shall be opened. It is he that asks well, which
asks wholesome things, and which asks with a sure trust: he seeks well
which seeks with contynuall desire: he knocks well, which does provoke and
move gods goodness with good works.

And in case ye receive not forthwith that ye ask, yet distruste nor the
bountifulnes and liberality of your father. For he will ^eue when need shall
require, and as much as shall be nedeful, if ye persevere and continue. For god is
as sone entreated of his children, If ye then being ill, ca^ give your children
good gifts. etc.
as manne being a father is entreated of his children. For what father is there
among you so unkind, that if his son require a profitable thing, as is
bread, will he not give him that he requires, but for bread will he give him
stones? Or if he ask him fyshe for to eat, will he give him a serpent instead
of fish? Truly he would deny it, if his son should ask him a stone, or
serpente, or some other noisome thing. Ye therefore which be naturally given to
ill, and also in other things ill for the most part, yet in this behalf,
not by virtue but through the instigacion of nature, ye keep this honest and
natural affection, that ye can give profitable things unto your children:
How much more than will your heavenly father being naturally good, do the
same? Will not he give unto you his children, his good things, if ye stir
and call upon, with fervent and contynuall desires, his bountefull goodness?

And as touching the life of man, which is hurt or helped with mut^all
gentylnes and injuries of both sides, because it were to long to g^^e
precepts and lessons of them severally, I will give you a general rule,
which is naturally planted and graued in all men. Every man well advised,
wylleth well to himself: but the common sort of men so love themselfes that
they will provide for their own commodity, to other men's hurt and
hynderaunce. But ye must not do the like: but as ye would wyshe others to be
toward you, even such be ye toward others. Every man that is in ignorance
desires to be taught: every man that does amiss, desires lovingly and
secretly to be monished, rather than to be openly blamed: every man that is
^^edy, would gladly have aid and souccoure: no man would be backebyted nor
slaundered, nor hindered of his good name. Therefore of this common wit and
understanding, which is given to all men, let every man take counsel of
himself, how he should use him self toward his neighbor. Let him not do to
another that which he would not should be done to himself: and that he
desires to be done to himself, let him do to another. This is the very brief
and sum of all things, which are taught by the law and prophets: The which
if a man for lack of leisure or for lack of skylfulnes can not turn over and
read, t^ulye every man has a rule at home in him self, by the which he may
direct and order his acts and deeds, so that he desire rather to follow right
reason, than lusts and desires.

If these things some hard unto them that love this world, if ye see the
most part of men follow the contrary, yet let nothing trouble your minds.
The better the things be, the harder is the way to them. Consider ye rather
whither this way does lead, than the easy entrye in to it. Let it be, there
be two gates: the one a narrow gate, where no man can enter but by a strait
and a narrow way, but this gate leads byanby to everlasting life: And
another gate large and broad, where all men may enter by a broad and a plain
way, but it leads byanby to everlasting destruction.

Enter ye therefore by the narrow gate, and desire rather to go to everlasting
life with a few, than to everlasting perdicio^ with many. For the large way
restrains no man with the laws of godlynes: and fawneth upon men with those
things which delyght the senses of the body and do please the lusts of the
mind: And few there be that find it.
and therefore it does allure many unto it, and within short time it sends
them so intised, through the large gate into miseryes, that cannot be told,
and delyuereth them being deceived with false goodness, unto extreme and very
ylles. How narrow is the gate, how straight is the way, that leads to
life? For it shows forth nothing that is pleasant to the flesh: it is
roughe and displeasaunt to many, and forth with it does offer unto them,
things that be paynful to nature: as pouertye, fasting, watching, sufferyng of
wrongs, chastity, sobernes. This gate receives not the^ that swell with
glory of this world, this gate receives not the^, that be puf^ up with
pride, this gate receives not them that be bolle^ with excess and ryo^: this
gate receives not them that draw with them abundance of worldly things. It
receives none, but such as be naked and unburdened of all the desires of this
world, and as a man would say, their bodies being put of, extenuated and fined
into the spirit. Whereby it cummeth to pass, that this gate is found but of a
few, because it is not spyed but with clear iyes, which do clearly see those
things that be spiritual.

Beware of false prophets.
But as touching such men as do daily, with lust, excess, pride, auaryce, and
with such other fylthy desires, and laughing like mad men, go hedlynge into
their own destruction, ye be in no peril: (for in following of them it is
rather madness, than error.) Ye must rather beware of them which company with
you having a cloak of godlynes, where as they be enemies of godlynes. They be
always talkyng of God the father, of the euangelycall doctrine, of the
kingdom of heaven, their apparel is course and simple, their chekes be lean
with fasting, their body is worn away with leanesse, they pray long, they
give to the poor, they teach the people, and expound the holy scriptures: and
being disguised with the cloak of these things they cum unto you apparelled as
though it were with sheep skins, whereas inwardly they be rauenyng wolves,
and deuourers of the euangelycall flock. It can not be hard to know the
wolf from the sheep, if each of them utter his own voice, and if each of them
be covered with his own skin. But what shall a man do where as the wolf
counterfeytyng the sheep both with the shepes skin, and the shepes voice,
crepeth into the sheep fold, not to becumme a sheep, but more cruelly to rent
and tear the sheep? The wolf cha^ugeth his voice and professes the name of
Christ, he professes the doctrine of the gospel, but to the the intent he
may poison with his heresye, them that be unawares and negligent. He
counterfeyteth godly works, to thinten^ he may the rather abuse the
simplicity of other to his desires. Therefore ye whom I have chosen to be the
kepers and feders of my flock, must diligently take heed of these. Ye shall
easily find out this counterfeyted iugglyng, if ye look narrowly upon, Ye
shall know them by their fruits.
not the title and vesture, but the very deeds which do disclose the
corrupt mind. For albeit they teach well, yet they do not in deed the
thing that they teach. Every tree has his peculyar and proper fruit, which
by the taste does declare the flock. If ye observe and mark dilygently their
life and manners, ye shall find that they stand in their own conceyte: they
look for their own profit, proud, reuengers, enuiouse, backeviters, desyryng
of glory, given to the belly, and always more diligente in their own
matters, tha^ in the matters of their flock, or the ghospel. I have showed you
which be the fruits of the euangelycal tree, that is to say, a mind far from
all pride, full of gentylnes, and not desirous of vengeance, a mind
despisynge all pleasures of this world, a mind despisynge riches, and
gredelye desyryng the godlynes of the gospel, a mind prompt and ready to
do good to all men, a mind pure and clean from all lusts and desires,
nor having no another iye but to God only, a mind refusing no affliccion or
trouble, so that he may promote and set forward the doctrine of the
gospel, a mind lokyng after no reward in this world for his well doings,
neither glory, nor pleasure, nor riches, a mind that wyllethe well even unto
his ill wyllers and does good to them which do him hurt. Whosoever truly
in deed brings forth these fruits, he is the evangelical tree. Therefore
they that show themselfes to be prophets, and boaste themselves of this
title, they that feyne themselfes by religiouse apparel to be sheep, where as
in heart and affeccio^ they be wolves, they must be esteemed and judged of these
fruits. Regard not the boughs and the bark. These oftentimes be common to
the^ that grow in the field and them that grow at home, to the wholesome and
unwholesome: the fruit once tasted does declare the juice of the tree. And if
ye see in these, avarice, arrogance, envy, desire of vengeance, dissemblyng,
and such other, which are clean contrary to the fruits of the evangelical
minds: think not that any good fruit will spryng of the same trees. For what
man is so mad to gather grapes of thorns, or fygges of brambles? that is to
say, of roughe and wild shrubbes, most plesaunte fruit? Likewise it is
emonge men. A very good tree, and bearyng gentle juice in the root of the
mind, brings forth good fruit. On the other side, a very ill tree, what
leaves and bark so ever it has, A good tree ca^ not bear ill fruits,
yet it brings forth ill fruits. And these can not be turned nor changed:
seeing their nature is utterly repugnau^t. For he that has a clean and a
sincere mind, must needs express in deeds, the syncerenes of his heart and
affeccio^: and again, he that has a faulty and an infected mind, can not
express in deeds, those things which declare a very good man. Although by
the iuglynges and color of holiness, sumtyme he deceyueth unware men, truly he
can not deceive God: Therefore they that be colourablie good, let them leave of
their color, and become good in deed.

For emonge men, of an ill tree, may be made a good. But if he continue in his
froward counterfeytyng let him fear, Therefore by their frui^tes ye shall
know the^.
less he suffer the like of god, that will revenge it, that the unfruitful
tree suffers of the tyllman. And what does it suffer? It is cut down and
cast in the fire. So, whosoever being in the kingdom of God bryngethe furthe
no fruit, or such fruit as is vncumlye for his profession, unless he
repent, he shall be cast into the everlasting fire. Therefore by this token ye
shall know them, that is to say, of the fruits, which if ye find in them to
be evil, ye shall remove them from the cure of the flock: and shall not
receive them into the kingdom of heaven, nor count them for Christians, but
for enemies: not to the intent to hurt them, but to beware lest they hurt the
flock, being myngled among them. For there is nothing more daungerouse than
ungodliness, if it gets faith and authority, thoroughe the false color of
holiness.

All they that profess me only with words, shall not be counted worthy the
kingdom of heaven: for it is not the title that makes a Christian man, but the
life. And I will not furthwith knowledge them for my disciples, which say
unto me religiousely, Lord, Lord, when in deed they serve diverse other lords:
that is to say, Mammon and riches, the belly and ambicion. Whom therefore shall
I think worthy the kingdom of heaven? Them that have utterly refused worldly
desires, and heartily do obey the will of the father which is in heaven, whose
will I preach unto you. For whatsoever I teach you, it cummeth from him. And
truly my name shall nothing profit them which lack my spirit and works,
specially in that day when rewards shall be appointed according unto every
man's deserts, not by man's judgment, which oftentimes does fail, but by
the judgment of god: and the sheep shall be secluded from the goats: so that
those things shall not profit them, which now seem amongst men, a
certain godly thing, and passing the doings of man. For than when they
shall see everlasting life prepared for them, which following the doctrine of
the gospel have declared themselfes to be my true disciples: Many will say
unto me etc.
and again when they shall see everlasting punishmente prepared for them that
shall be removed from the company of the godly, many being sore aferde shall
come and desire now to be known of God, where as they have counterfeited
before men the chief and most excellent disciples of Christ, and preachers
of the gospel, and they shall say unto me: Lord knoweste thou not us thy
servants? Have not we prophesied in thy name? have not we chased a way
devils in they name? have we not reised up dead men in thy name? have we
not put away poisons and diseases in thy name? have we not wrought other
wonders in thy name? and by these deeds glorified thy name? we have declared us
to be thine by so many arguments and tokens, and now doeste thou not know
us? Than shall they hear this answer of me. Truly I never knew you, Depart
from me ye that work ini^quitie.
no not than when ye did these things. I heard you say, lord, lord, but I
never perceived in you ye heart of faithful servants. I hear much speaking
of my name, but I never felt my spirit in you: I hear of miracles which were
done in my name, but I hear not of those special fruits, by the which the
true disciple of Christ is known. Wherefore seeing that than, when ye did set
forth your selves amongst men in my name, ye were not mine in deed, but
under the color of my professyon ye served the* dyuell, depart now away
from me, and go unto him whose spirit ye have received, and whose will ye did
obey. What title or name soever they have, if they weorke unrighteousness, they
shall not be partakers of my kingdom.

But like as the fruit of the tree can have no good taste, unless the root
have good juice: So the buyldyng, be it never so gorgiouse, high, and galaunte
outwardelye, shall not be sure, unless it be stayed upon a suit and sound
foundation. He that has my spirit, that is to say, a sincere affeccion,
regarding naught else but the glory of God, he is a tree of a good root: So
he that stayethe not upon the vain things of this world, but upon the true
good things of the mind, and does continue constantly in the same: he very
polytikely builds the buyldyng that never shall fall. Therefore whosoever
hears my words, and not hears only, but reposeth them inwardly in his
heart, to thintente he may express in his deeds that, that he has learned:
I say that he is like a man both wise and politic, who to thintente he may
build a sound and sure buyldyng, first of all he deuiseth and looks for a
sound and a sure foundation, whereupon he may set his buyldyng to endure
against all tempests of wethers. For in a calm wether every buyldyng stands
safely, but the winter proves the soundnes of the buyldyng. Some time
abundance of rain falls down and beats upon it: Sometime the fluddes
increased with rain, all to shake it with great violence: Because (...) was
grounded upon the rock.
Sometime the burlyng of the wyndes beats against it, and being beaten and
laid at by so many ways, it stands still and moves not. Why so? Because it
stands upon a sure foundation.

The buylder did foresee all these things, and therefore he set it upon a
sound rock, through whose aid it neded nothing to fear all those
assaults. Again whosoever hearethe my words, and hearethe them only, and
does not repose them in his heart, nor express them in his deeds, is like
unto the rechellesse buyld, who not foreseynge the storms and tempests,
settethe his building upon the sand, which is a foundation ever fletyng and
failing, and nothing trusty. Afterward falls abundance of rain, the
violence of ryuers runs upon it, the storm of winds runs against it,
and the house is leused and plucked up from the foundation, and fallethe down
with a great crashe. Why so? Because the building was goodly and gaye to see
to, but it stood upon an unprofitable foundation. Therefore your principal
chief care and consideracion must be of your foundation: fasting, alms,
prayer, simple apparel, finally miracles, be like a gay building. But if the
mind of him that does them, look after vain praise of men, after lucre, or
after pleasure, all shall fall when the sore storm of temptacion draws nere.
But whose affeccion and desire is surely fastened in the doctrine and promyses
of the ghospel, lokyng for the reward of his well doings of God only, he
shall be able to stand against all displeasures and injuries, against the
cruel persecucio^s of the wicked, against the craftye assaults of heritikes:
Finally against all the engyns of Satan, and against death it self, shall he
be hable to stand styffely, without discouragement, until that day when that
Perseueraunce, the conqueror of all euels, shall receive her crown.

When Jesus had ended these sayings, the multitude mused much at this new
trade of doctrine. For they heard no such thing of the Scribes or Phariseis,
which if they added any thing unto Moses law to bring them self in
estimacion with the people, they used to bring furthe certain werishe
constitucions, of wasshyng their hands before meat, of washyng the body if
any came home from markete, of washinge of cups, of paying of tithes, that
came of mintes and of rue. Jesus taught no such thing, but where as he set
forth by miracles what he could do in deeds, he declared himself to be the
same in doctrine, For he taught the^ as having power.
forbydding with authority, that which the law favorably did suffer, and
requiryng that which the law did not require. The law suffered divorce for
every cause: Jesus forbade all divorces unless it were for aduoutry. The law
forbade nothing but to kill: Jesus required, that we should not be angry with
our brethren, and declared evidently that he was not only the interpreter, but
the lord of the law also: not the minister, but the author. Finally a
certain lyuelines, of his perfect doctrine, and a certain natural strength
of truth, And not as the scribes.
touched and enspired the simple multitude which was desirouse to learn, and
never had experience of the like in their Scribes and Phariseis.

The.viii. Chapter.

THerefore when Jesus had spoken these weyghtye and high things in the
mount, not to every man, but chieflye to his disciples, and to such as were
able to follow them with cherefulnes of the spirit: he does abase himself
again to the humylytie and lownes of the common sort, which had many
unwieldy, weak, lame, and sick, whom he thought to allure to the desire of
heavenly things, through corporal benefytes. And in healyng of them he did
the same by significacion, which he did by his doctrine in healyng the
diseases of the mind.

Either of these things gave credit and authority to other. We believe him the
more willingly whom we love, and love is wunne by benefits. And his saying
weyeth well with us, whom we see and perceive to be so mighty in deeds.
Therefore when Jesus left the hill and came into the plain, diverse companies
of men drew unto him on every side, to the intent that many might bear witness of
the miracles that he should do.

Wherefore a great number being gathered together, behold, there cummeth forth
a certain man geuyng occasion of a miracle, and teaching them withal, as by a
figure, from whence and by what faith, they that were diseased with the leprye
of the soul, should seek remedy. For there came forth a certain man having
his body infected with the lepry. This disease among the Jews was counted
much abominable, and is thought to be such, that no physician can heal it.
The judgment of this disease, as of a sacrate thing, was appoyncted unto the
priests, which searched out by meruaylouse and diverse obseruacions, whether
the body of any man were infected with the veraye leprye or not. It was not
leful for them that were judged to have this disease, to cum in the company of
men, neither was it lefull to touch the body which was defiled with this
disease. This man therefore judged of the pristes, and being foul with the very
lepry, durst yet cum to Jesus, which is the purifier and clenser of all. The
desire of health took away shame fastnes, the approved goodness of Jesus
toward all men made him bold. Lord if thou will ye may make me clean.
So many examples of other, which returned home being made whole, made him to
trust well: Therefore when he fell down before Jesus and worshypped him, he
said: Lord if thou will thou may cleanse me. What would a proud pharise
or one of Moses priests have done in this case? he would have abhorred the
unclean and fylthy man, and would have disdayned to have talked with him. But
Jesus playing the part of a good shepeherde, having delight in the man's faith,
And Jesus put forth has hand. etc*
which was joined with so great modesty and coldenes, which also durst nor
desire to be cleansed, unless it might stand with the pleasure of him, who
knowethe what is meet for every man, (but yet he doubted not but that he was
able if he would) Jesus (I say) refused not the unclean manne, but reched
out his hand and touched him. And here he did neglecte the law, as touching
the letter. And spoke such words whereby he declared both the goodness of his
will, and the greatness of his power. Because (quod he) thou do believe that I
can if I will, I will: Be thou whole. And as soon as he had spoken, the skin
was changed, and the disease left him, the people being witness of the same.

After this, to thintente the miracle might the better be believed, and also
the priests have no occasion of reprofe to reprove or misconstrue that he
should take upon him authority to judge of the leprye, and to pluck unto him
the lucre and gain which was wunt to cum unto them of such as were cleansed of
leprye, But go and (...) thy self to the priest. etc.
he says unto him: See thou tell no man that thou art purged of the lepry.
For it is not thy part to judge of thy self, and I take not upon me the
office of the priests.

Therefore first of all go unto the priest and show thy self unto him, and if
he declare the to be clean, which heretofore has declared the to be leprose,
then shall thou offer the gift which Moses commanded to be offered of them,
who chanced to be cleansed of the leprye: lest afterward they lay unto thy
charge* and blame the which came among the multitude: and me also which
could not give perfect health. For the gift which they receive of thee as
pure and clean, shall reprove them if hereafter for hatred of me, they begin
falsely to blame that that is done. For if thou were not leprouse before, why
did they remove the from the congregation? If thou be not now clean, why have
they received of thee thy gift, as of him that was pourged and cleansed? Jesus
would that the people should testify how much profit the Leaper had by his
faith, and how lightly with a word he took away all his disease, to
thintente they might give ear unto his doctrine with the same faith, whereby
they might be healed of the diseases of the mind.

Therefore after that he had taught the Jews by this fact and deed, that the
way unto ealth was easy by the sincerenes of faith: So forthwith he teaches
in the captain of an hundred men, that the way unto health, was not stopped
from the Gentiles, so that they have faith mete and worthy for the gospel.
For when he was entered into Capernaum, which is a town not far from the
poole of Genesareth in the borders of zabulou and Neptalim, there came unto him
a certain captain, the which kind of men, the Jews abhorred for two
causes. First because they be vncircumcysed for the most part, and alienes
from Moses law: secondlye because that kind of life is defamed commonly.
Lord my servant lies at home sick of the palsy, etc.
But the good Jesus which came to heal all men, turns not him away
neither. The captain makes a request unto him, saying: Lord I have a
servant at home, whom I love intierly, for that he is faithful and profitable
in service: He now wholly unprofitable, lies upon his bed, diseased with the
palseye: and he is not only unprofitable unto me, And is sore vexed, etc.
but also he is sore vexed with the rage of his disease, being now at deaths
door. And this kind of disease, like as it is daungerouse and grievous: so is
it not lyghtlye cured by the art of Phisicians.

Jesus delightyng in the faith of the man (which doubted not but that with a
word he was hable to heal his servant being absent) to thintente he might
declare unto all men, the faith and trust of the man joined with great
humility of heart, answered: I will come, and I will heal him.

Whereunto (quod the Captain) Lord? I am no Jew, I am a captain to be
abhorred of the Jews, for twoe causes, and therefore much unworthy, that
thou shouldeste enter into my house and be defiled with my company. There is
no need of thy bodily presence: Only say the word, and (such is thy power
and might) furthwith my servant shall be healed. Thou haste angels and
messengers to whom thou mayeste commit such business. I know by my self, I
have a ruler to whom I am subject, I am obediente to his commandments,
neither is it needful for him to do all things. It is sufficient for him to
commit his matters with authority. Again I have soldiers under my rule, by
whom I do those things which be not meet for me. Only I give my
commandment, and they obey the same: I command one to go some whither, and
he goes. I command another to cum, and he cummeth. Again unto mine own
private servant I say, do this or do that, and he spedely does what he is
commanded. If my servants obey me being a sinner and an ab^ecte: how
much more ought youres to be obediente unto your commandments? Jesus
hearing these things merueyled, not for that he was ignorante of the man's
faith, but because he would cause all men to marvel at it, and turnynge
unto the Jews which followed him, and as it were castyng them in the teeth
with their unbelief, said: This I assure you, hitherto have I not found so
great faith in my people of Israel, as I have found in this stranger:
which neither knowethe the Prophets, neither has received my doctrine, nor
has ^een my miracles.

Ye stand in your own conceyte, because ye be the children of the
patriarchs, whom god loves* because ye are the peculiare people of god to
whom this health and salvation is promised. But this I assure you: the time
shall be, that many shall come on every side from the vttermoste parts of the
world, whom ye do loathe and abhor as strangers and alyens, which shall
enter in by faith, and sytte in the kingdom of heaven with Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob: and your fathers shall acknowledge them for their evangelical faith,
as their lefull children, and shall take them to their table to be partakers of
the everlasting felicity. Contrary wise the children of the kingdom, which
touching the fleshly kynrede, cummeth of the stock of Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, for their unbelief, shall not only not be received to that goodlye and
happy feast, but they shall be thruste out into the outward darkness, There
shall be weping and gnasshynge of teeth.
because they would not see before, the light that was offered them. There
shall they be punished for their unbelief, weeping and gnasshyng with teeth:
having intelligence now to late from what grea^e felicity they be fallen by
their malice: and envy shall make their sorrow the more, what time they shall
se strangers and aliens to be received to the felicity and honor, which
was promised unto them.

When Jesus had spoken these things unto the Jews, to the intent they should
give the more credit unto his saying through the miracle, he turnyng unto the
captain, says: Go thy way, and as thou haste believed, so be it done unto
the. Clerelye declaryng that health is not given, neither to the stock and
kindred, neither to the other merits, but to faith only which he required,
and found lack of, in most part of the Jews. And as he said, so the thing
followed. For it was tried that the self same time the Capitaynes servant was
sodeynlye delivered from his disease, that no man should suspecte that it
was done by chance, or by the help of Phisicians. For as no man is sodeinly
delivered from the lepry after the course of nature: so the palsy forsakes no
man suddenly.

And he touched her hand and the fever left her*
When he had showed forth these and certain other miracles, he withdrewe
himself for a time from the multitude, and went into a house that was common
to Simon Peter and Andrewe his brother. There followed on James and John. There
he knew that Peter's mother in law haddess great a fever, that she kept her
bed: and he being desired to heal her tarried not but took her by the hand and
lift her up, and forth with her whole fever went away, lyuelines and
cherefulnes returned, in somuche as she ministered and served them of meat: so
clerelye was she delivered from all grudgyng of the Ague. Truly no part of
the fever remained, where as they which be healed by the art of phisicians
be troubled long time after their disease with feebleness and lothsumnes. Now
when night drew on, a great multitude cummethe thycke and swarmethe at the
doors: lokyng that after his meat, he would return again unto his well
doing. As he came furthe, they offered unto him a meruaylouse number that were
vexed with diverse diseases, and also demontakes which were possessed with
deuylies, he casting out the spirits, and puttinge away the diseases,
healed them all: wherein also he did agreablye unto his name. There was none so
fow^e and so horrible kind of diseases, which Jesus would loathe and turn
away from. There was none so vehemente or incurable, which furthewyth at his
commandment did not forsake the man.

With a word he healed all, freely he healed all, doing now the self same
thing in taking a way indifferently the diseases of the body, And healed all
that were sick.
which he went about to do in taking away sins, which be the more
fyerce diseases of the minds. Truly for this he came into the world: and
this was it, that Esaias prophesied of him many years paste: he took our
infirmities wyllyngly upon himself, and he did bear our diseases.

head. And another of the number of his disciples said unto him: Master,
suffer me first to go and b^ry my father. But Jesus said unto him. Follow me,
and let the dead bury their dead. And when Jesus saw that the multitude
would not depart, though he had healed all the sick and diseased, and
though night were at hand, for now the sun was gone to glade, but that
they came thick about him on every side more and more: he commanded his
disciples to prepare him a ship to go over the water, that by that means he
might be delivered from the multitude. This once heard, certain of them
departed home. But a certain importunate Scribe followed Jesus unto the water
side, desyryng to be received into the number of his disciples: whom he had
seen so magnified of the people for his power in showing of miracles: not to
the intent he would follow his doctrine and life, but that he might get him
renoune and lucre of his miracles. He therefore cumming unto Jesus, said:
Master I will follow the whither soever thou go. It was a word mete for
him that should have been a disciple, if the word and the heart had agreed.
He put forth himself of his own accord, and offered himself unto all
things, nor made no pretense of ^ariyng. But Jesus neither repelled the man's
importunity, neither laid unto his charge his corrupt mind, but secretly
monyshed him that he was up mete disciple for him, nor himself likewise no
mete master: for whosoever looks after the commodities of this world,
joins himself unto him but folyshly, which neither had nor sought for,
neither riches, nor glory, nor kingdom in this world: but embraced extreme
poverty, ignominy and affliccion: in so much as he had not those things
which the birds and beasts lacks not. The fore^ have holes
The foxes (quod he) although they have no houses, yet have they holowe dens
to hyde them in. The birds fliyng and wauoring in the air, in the stead of
houses have nestes to rest them in. But the son of man has, not where to rest
his head.
But the son of man so is destitute of all succors of this world, that he
has no place to lay his head in. If any manne desire such a Master, if he
will, let him follow me: but with heart and affeccio^, and not only with the
steps of the feet. So the Scri^e knowing his own conscience, did forbear
to follow him.

Again one of them which began to be in the noumbre of his disciples moved by
tray^tie and weakness, when he heard of the extreme poverty of Christ, ^^kyng
an occasion by sum coloare to slip away from the disciples of Jesus: Lord
(quod he) before I follow the wholly, whither soever thou go, suffer me
first to return home and burye my father. The cause to the apperau^ce seemed
godly, but Jesus willing to teach that all things should be set a part in the
matter of everlasting health, and that herein all tariyng and lingeryng is
dau^gerouse: suffered not the young man being of a good mind, but yet feeble
and wea^e to ^e entangled with busynes of testamentes of the dead, under the
pretense of godlynes, and whites he provides for the vile inheritance of the
world, Let ye dead bury^ they^ dead.
to fall from the inheritance of heaven. Nay (quod he) thou shalt ^ow nothing
have to do with thy dead father, which haste professed thy self to the
heavenly life, there will be ynow to burye thy father. Suffer the dead to bury
their dead, and let them put them in the yearthe, which love yearthely
things, let them burye him which is dead in the earth, which being alive
be both dead and also buried. They be alive to men, they be dead to God. Be
thou careful to live, and depart from the company of the dead, if thou will
live in deed.

Therefore when Jesus had sent away the multitude, and was entered into the
ship, his disciples waiting upon him, as he rowed, suddenly there ro^^
atempeste, and the water was so moved, that the waves overwhelmed the ship.
Jesus in the mean season slept upon a pillowe, signifiyng as it were by a
figure, what peril there is in things here in the world, as often as they
sleep being delighted with commodities and pleasures of this world, which
have taken upon them to be instead of Christ. But in these tempests ^amp;
troubles the disciples do show where we should seek for succor. For they
being amassed we fear, pluck at Christ, and wake him out of his sleep. Lord
(quod they Love us, we be lost. For yet they believed he was but only man, and
that they could not be safe, Lord save us
unless that he were awake. Therefore Jesus inyodyng to make them hold and
without fear, and conquerours against al assaults of the most sore and
vehement troubles, rebukyng their great fear: Why fear ye (quod he) ye men of
li^le faith. Ye which have seen so many miracles, ^amp; have heard my
doctrine, ought to be put in fear with nothing, as though the help of God
would fail you in any place, if so be that faith and trust never fail you,
which as yet I se not in you so much as ought to be. After that Jesus had
thus manis^ed his disciples, he rose, and to the intent to show him fel^e the
Lord of all the elements, he rebuked the wyndes, and the sea, and furthwith
the tempest seized, and there followed a marvelous caulme, because it might the
more appear, that it was done, not by the strength of man, ^at by the power
of God, for there is nothing more disobedient or unruly, than the sea once
troubled, and yet at the Lords commandment, it was suddenly turned into a
great calm. Further the disciples and other which were in the ship, much
musyng at so merueylouses matter, said: what might ye man is this* for utterly
he seems to be more than man, for not only diseases and devils, but also
winds and the sea obey his commandments. And by this ^^aumple, Jesus our
very good Lord has taught us, that as often as the ^^ormes of te^ptacions
and persecucions rage against us, that we should se^^ for help no another
where but of him. Every tumult and trouble shall be made caulme and quiet, if
that he awake in us.

title came forth to meet Jesus. And when they saw him, they besought him to
depart out of their coa^es. Therefore when Jesus had passed over the water, he
came into the country of the Gergesites, and behold there was offered a
matter and an occasion of a greater wonder. There met him two men, which of
long time had been possessed with the wurst kind of deuilles, which either
wandered in the wilderness, or else hid themselves in dead men's graves,
which were wont to be made and set up by the high way. Their rage was so
great, that no cheynes could hold them, but breakyng all their bonds rani^e
upon the way goers, so that no man could safely pass that way. No man durst
bring them unto Jesus, as I have told you how they did with diverse other, but
the secret might of Jesus drew them against their wylles. The wicked spirits
were sore ^ered, and could not abide the divine power, in so much that being
guilty in themselves, they felt a certain new and a secret tormente, yea
before that Jesus spoke unto them, they feared lest the day were no we at
hand in the which they should be sent into the dungeon of hell, there to be
punished eternally, and not to be suffered hereafter to molest and trouble men.
Therefore torment and fear forced them against their wills, O Jesus the sone of
god what have we to do with the?
to speak and to bear witness of the divine power in Christ. They cried out
therefore by the mouths of the miserable men. Jesus the son of God (quod they)
what have thou to do with us? Art thou come hither to torment us before our
time? we know what misery and wretchedness a^ydeth for us according to our
merits, but suffer us for a time. That day shall come to us to soon. We
desire delay and not to be delivered. Not far from the place where these
things were done, there was an heard of hogs feding, than the devils feling
themselves to be sore vered by the power of God, lest they should depart
without any hurt doing (so great was their malice) they made this peticion
unto Jesus: If in no case thou will suffer us to dwell and abide in this house,
suffer us at the lest, that we may depart hence and enter into the hogs, a
beast both filthye and abhomynable.

As soon as Jesus had given them this liberty, which thought it sufficient to
provide for the health and salvation of man, the multitude of diyels went forth
with into the heard of hogs. And behold forth with the whole heard, driven
into a fury, ran down hedlong from the hill into the water, and there
perished in the water. This suffered Jesus both to show the notable malice of
the devils, and to give occasion that this miracle might be bruted abroad. For
the swyneheardes seeing this horrible sight, ran away for fear, and went into
the city of Gadera, and told the citezens what they had seen, and what had
happened to the Demoniakes, now commonly known, to whom it chanced to be
healed, and what had happened to the heard of hogs. The whole city of ye
Gaderenes being amassed at this tidinges, went forth to meet Jesus, fearing
lest he should come to them. They saw their hogs killed. They saw the two men
that were naked, now appareled, they saw them healed of their frenesy and
quiet out of their rage, inso much that they sat at Jesus feet knowlegyng him
to be the author and cause of their health. But because the^e Gaderenes were
gross and evil, they feared more the might of Jesus, than they loved his
goodness, and they regarded more the loss of their swyne, than the health of
men.

They went unto Jesus and desired him to depart from their coasts: who if they
had thoroughly known him, they would have desired him instantly that he would
have vouched safe to come into the coasts of their country, to do the same
thing in their hearts, which he did in the two Demoniakes. for the hogs
declare what was their life, the which ye deuilles desired to possess in the
stead of men. Therefore Jesus taught them nothing, content only to put them in
fear: notwithstanding he has taught us by this exaumple, that there is no
pestilence, nor poison of the mind so sore, that we should despair of health,
if we chance to come to Jesus. For there be ^ertayne desires so unbridled, so
vehement, and so wild, that they drive and force him that has them, unto
withecraft, manslaughter, to slaughter of his dearest friends, and to other
wicked deeds not to be named, and sumtyme they drive him unto such madness,
that he kills himself. No meaues of man can heal and help these things,
only Jesus can give health if he will vouchesafe to come unto them. There is
no despair, he will vouchesafe if they again will come to him.

The.ix. Chapter.

Jesus therefore not minding to give that that is holy unto dogs, nor to cast
preciouse stones unto swine, entered into the ship, and went over the water
again, returnyng into his city called Capernau^, for there he had a house at
that time. And when he was entered into the house, many gathered about him,
among whom were also doctors of the law, that came from Galile, Iewry, and
Jerusalem, and as he sat, (the Scribes and the doctors sitting by him) he
taught them. And when there came about him so great a number of men, that the
house was now to little, nor the entrye was not hable to receive so great a
multitude, certain there were which brought unto him a certain man grieved
and vexed with so vehement a palseye, that he was carried of four men bed and
all, which was rather a karkas of a man, then a man. Who when they knew that
Jesus was within, They brought unto him a man sick of the palsy.
and that they could not enter for the multitude, they clymed up upon the
house top, and remouyng the tiles of the house, let down by ropes through a
hole the bed with the sick man, before the feet of Jesus. Jesus not offended,
nor grieved with this importunity of the servants, but rather allowing the
feruencie of their faith, and albeit the faith of the sick man ought to be no
less, which either commanded that he should be let down, or else wiilyngly
suffered it: turning unto the manne bedred, to thinte^t that he might co^me^de
his faith very much to the^ that stood about: be of good courage my son
(quod he) thy sins be forgeuen the: first delivering that part of the man
from disease, from whence the disease of the body came: and yet meruelouse
gently he calls him son, being a man wretched and miserable both in body
and soul, privily casting the phariseis and Scribes in the teeth with their
pride and arrogancy. This man blasphemeth.
The multitude keeping silence and marueling, certain of the Scribes which
remembered that God says in the holy scripture: It is I that put away the
sins of men, whereas in such a great resort of the favorers of Jesus they
durst not openly murmur against him, they spoke secretly with themselves:
this is a blasphemer of God, which being but man, takes upon him the power of
God. But Jesus which had somewhat declared his godly power unto the phariseis
in forgeuing of sins, declares the same also by a special sign, openyng
and showing that it is not hyd from him, what every man does think.

Therefore making answer unto those things, which they spoke with themselves
in their secret thought, says: Why do ye envy at well doings thinking ill in
your hearts? Suppose ye because the disease of the mind is not seen with
bodily iyes, like as the health also, that I take upon me untruly, and promise
unto other that I cannot perf^urme? But whether think ye more easy to say to
him that is in sin, as I said even now, thy sins be forgeuen thee: or else
to say unto the man diseased with the palse^, whom ye see wholly bound with
diseases, arise and walk? Therefore to the intent that by the reason of things
that ye see, ye may also believe the things true that ye see not, and that
both are indi^erently easy to the son of man, with a word to take away
the disease, and to pardon the sins, I will give you a sign and a token
manifest and open to every man's sense and understanding. And in case ye
shall see these words which I shall speak now not to be vain, but to have
their present efficacy and strength, doubt not but that the son of man has
power in earth to forgive sins, and that not by sacrifices, or by
holocaustes, but by simple and plain word. And therewith turnyng to the
diseased of the palsy, said: Arise, take up thy couche and depart into thy
house, that they which have known the sick, Arise take up thy bed and go
home*
and despayred of thy health, may see and perceive that thou art suddenly made
whole and strong, insomuche that thou art not only hable to go upon thy feet,
which a little before wast borne of.iiii. ports, but also, the course of
things now changed, thou art hable to bear the bed, which hitherto has
borne thee. And furthwith as he spoke, the thing came to pass, the diseased of
the palsy ryseth up, and laying the bed upon his shoulders, departs into his
house after an other manner of fashyon and pomp, than he was carried a little
before. When the multitude saw this evident and manifest miracle, and plainly
perceived that it was a thing not of the power of man, but of God, they
glorified God which gave such power unto men in earth, saying that they
never saw such a thing done of them, which are counted the chief and the
most excellent men among the Jews. But the Scribes were so put to silence,
that they were the more styrred and exasperate with envy, because they sought
more their own glory then the glory of God: by the which increasyng and
shynyng forth daily through Jesus, they saw themselves to be diminished and
darkened. For like as the sun darkeneth the candle: so the glory of God
darkeneth, and causes to vanishe away the vain glory of men. But the envy of
these men profyted to none other end, but through resistaunce, to make the
glory of Christ more manifest and notable. For god can use the malice of men,
unto his glory and renoume. Therefore Jesus to give place to the envy of the
Scribes, departed thence, and returned unto the mere and poole, where he
taught the multitude gathering about on every side.

Further as he passed by the custom house, he espied sitting there a certain
Publicane called Matthewe, which also was named Leuy the son of Alpheus. And
this kind of men because of their filthy gain and great extorcion, be defamed
and slaundered many ways, especially among the Jews. But Jesus which
heretofore called unto him Simon and Andrewe, John and James, from an homely
and a mean kind of gain, but yet honest and lawful, now to declare openly
that he despises utterly no kind of men, so that they repent and turn them
to the better: called unto him Matthewe, and commanded him to follow. He
without any ^arrying, leauyng his accomptes imperfect, leauying his lucre and
gain, began to follow Jesus: and suddenly became of a Publicane, a disciple.
For the voice of Jesus, had a certain wonderful efficacy and strength, and a
certain secret power and majesty shining in his countenance, whereby whom
he would, he allured and drew unto him, even like as the stone called Magnes,
draws iron. After that, Matthewe desired Jesus, that he would vouchesafe to
feast in his house. And it came to pass. etc.
Which thing Jesus did without any grief, to teach his disciples that they
should not forsake the cumpanye of wicked men, if there be any hope that they
will be the better by their cumpany. Matthewe of such things as he had than,
made a bounti^ull and a great feast, unto the which he brought many of his
sort of men, both Publicanes and sinners, whom by his example and
communicacion, Behold many Publicanes. etc.
he allured unto admiracion, and love of Jesus. Therefore when the Phariseis
saw Jesus and his disciples sitting at meat with them, seking for matter on
every side of blame and reprofe, they dare not speak unto him lest they might
hear that which they would not, but endeavor to withdraw his disciples from
him. Why (quod they) does your master (whom ye follow as one notably holy)
feast with Publicanes and sinners, And when the Phariseis saw it etc.
whom we forbear as filthye and abominable? But like do soon flock with
the like: and commonly we become such as they be, with whom we live. When
that Jesus heard his communicacio^, he takes upon him to defend his
disciples, being yet but weak: teaching that the preachers of the gospel be
not defiled with the cumpany of sinners, with whom they cumpany for no another
intent, but to allure them to goodness. But the Phariseis do shun and flee
from the Publicanes, which commonly be counted sinners, not because they would
not be defiled with their sinfulnes, but to the intent that they themselves being
wurse than the Publicanes, may be counted holy among men: but they that be
^udued with the holiness of the gospel, do not desire the cumpany of sinners,
to the intent that they would take any lucre or vauntage from them, but to
enrich them with godliness, and they enter into their houses for no another
purpose, than the good physicions enter into the houses of sick men. For it
becu^meth a faithful physicion, to be more often in no place, than among them
which have need of the help of physicions. Therefore he turnyng unto the
Phariseis, which thought themselves just men, whereas indede they were
infected with much wurse vice, says unto them: I cumpanye with the
Publicanes and sinners, because I am the physicion of the souls, and thyrste
for the health of men. To what purpose is it to cumpany with the just, as ye
suppose your selves to be, since they need no physicion? They need a physicio^
that be ill at ease, and the physician is profitable unto the^, which knowlage
their disease, and be willing to be healed. Therefore to loathe and despise the^
it is no holiness but pride: and to succoure them, it is a sacrifice much more
acceptable to god, then any kind of sacrifice which is offered in the temple.
Ye which know the scriptures, Bo ye rather and learn what that means.
ought not to be ignorant in this, where god speaks thus: I will mercy
rather than sacrifice. Again in Esai, he refuses your offeringes, but the
work of mercy, he never refuses. If ye have not yet marked this thing, go and
learn what this word of god means, and than if ye think good, reprove my
doing, which is not contrary to your law, but agreeable to the will of god. And
why should I refuse the cumpany of sinners, which came purposely to stir and
provoke such manner of men to repentance of their former life? Many think
themselves just: if I with draw my self from them, they ought not to be
grieved, for they have no need of my help. And it were a vayn thing, and but a
rebuke to call them to repentance, which have nothing to repent. With this
talking Jesus touched and in manner skorned the arrogant pride of the Phariseis,
which thought them selves to be just, and were not.

After these things, certain disciples of John, which by the reason of a
certain carnal affeccion, did envy Jesus, magnifiyng John their master, as
one more excellent than Jesus, ioynyng them selves with the Phariseis, go unto
Jesus, and fear not falsely to blame him to his face, because he used his
disciples over delicately, and brought the^ not up so hardly as John did his,
which seemed to promise a more hard and strait disciplyne. The Phariseis
sought for a fame and an opinyon of holiness among the people by two ways
chiefly: that is by fasting and prayer. Wherefore they demand of Jesus, why do
we the disciples of John and the Phariseis fast so often, and pray after the
ordinance of our aunceters, which have taught that prayer should be commended
and set forth by fasting, and thy disciples use not like fast? Unto this
manifest and false reprose, because it touched him, and not his dysciples,
Jesus answered very gentely, And Jesus said unto them: Can the brydegromes. etc
so that he neither reproved the ordinance of John, neither plainly condemned
the fastings of other men. But only showed that the gentleness, which he used
toward his disciples, was not of negligence, but of policy, whereby he
brought them by little and little to greater things, even as when a wise and
skillful teacher of youth does not furthwith fear the tender age with hard
things, but with inticementes allureth it to things of difficulty, and
takes occasion to answer, by yt reason of the witness that John bare. For
hetestifiyng of Jesus before the^ that thought that John was Christ: he that
has a spouse (quod he) is a spouse, and his friend stands by and reioyseth
much because he hears the voice of the spouse, meaning Jesus to be the
spouse whom the prophecye in the psalm did promise should cum like a
bridegroom out of his chaumbre: and he himself nothing else but the friend of
the spouse. Jesus therefore putting them in remembrance of the saying of John,
says: Can the children which be in the chamber of the new spouse, whereas al
things ought to be joyful be troubled and grieved with the Jewish and lowryng
fast, chiefly seeing the spouse is present? Envy them not for this joy which
will not long endure. Suffer them to be led with this te^dernes gentely and
swetely unto things of more perfeccio^. Now they have their spouse, and they
be holy set on him, they have no leisure now to fast: and they be so tender,
that they cannot away with it. In the mean season they shall grow and were,
and the time shall cum, when their spouse shall be taken from them, than they
being stronger, shall not only fast of their own accord, but also they shall be
able to suffer sharper showers. The Jews put the chiefest point of their
religion in of ten fastinges, and long prayers: These things as they be not to
be reproved. if they be not done for vaynglory but for godliness: so the
doctrine of ye gospel has an iye and regard unto stronger things, and matter
of more weight, unto the which things I frame and fashion my scholars by
little and little. Therefore my manner of teaching agrees not with John. It is
new that I teach, and my doctrine is new, and a new manner of teaching is most
semely for a new kind of doctrine. It behooves not a schole master to be
over hasty: the thing shall declare it self in time, whose scholars be better
brought up and taught. Old things must not be mengled with new. For no man
sows a patche of new and raw cloth in an old garment. For by this way, the
hole of the old garmente is not only not mended, but also the hole is made
greater and more ill favored, because the new cloth agrees not with the old.
Neither do me^ put new wine into old bottelles.
And they that be wise and polytike men, put not new wine into old
vessels. For than a double inconvenience follows, whilst both the wine
runs out, and the vessels be broken and utterly lost. But rather put new
wine into new vessels, which may bear the strength of the wine, nor start
a su^der with the boiling and working of the wine. So both the vessels be
saved, and also the wine. I will my disciples to be al new, and so I fashion
them for me by little and little, that in time to cum they may be strong
and styffe to bear the might of the doctrine euangelycall. John durst put no
another than old wine in old vessels, as fasting and such other, which be
far from those things that men of the gospel must perfourm. I do not commit
the sweet wine of my doctrine but unto new vessels.

him, saying: my daughter is even now deceassed, but cum, and lay thy hand
upon her, and she shall live: and Jesus arose and followed him, and his
disciples also. And behold a woman diseased with an ^ssue of blood twelve
years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment. For she said
within her self, if I may touch but his vesture only, I shall be whole. But
Jesus turned him, and when he saw her, said: daughter be of good comfort, thy
faith has made the safe: And the woman was made whole even the same time. And
when Jesus came into the rulers house, and saw the minstrels and the people
making a noise, he said unto them: get ye hence, for the maid is not dead,
but sleapeth: and they laughed him to skorne. But when the people were put
forth, he went in and took her by the hand, and the damsel arose. And this
rumor went abroad into all the land. Jesus speaking these things, there came
unto him a certain warde^ of the Synagoge called Iairus, and falling humbly
upon his knees wurshipped him, and with behement prayer and besechyng, said: my
only daughter twelve year of age, was at the point of death, when I came from
home, and I am afeard lest that she be now dead. And Jesus arose and followed
him. etc
Cum I pray you, and lay your hand upon her, that she may recover and live.
Jesus (as he was ready to do good to al men which asked with plain trust and
confidence, whether they were pore or rich, Jews or strangers) forthwith arose
up and followed Iairus, which made haste home if perhaps he might find his
daughter yet alive. The disciples and the thick multitude followed Jesus. And
behold as he was going, there befell an occasion of an other miracle. There was
among the great multitude, of people a certain woman, which had been diseased
with the bluddy flixe for the space of twelve years, and had spent her whole
substance upon phisicions, and yet found she none that could heal her
disease. Therefore was she in double misery, for that poverty was joined with
her sickness. This woman when she had conceived in her heart a great trust
and co^fide^ce in Jesus, because of the filthiness of her disease, she durst not
speak unto Jesus before so many witnesses. Therefore as though she would steal
a benefit secretly, she came privily behynd his back, and touched the hem of
his garment. For she said within he self: if I may. etc.
For thus she persuaded her self: if I touch but the uttermost part of his
garmente I shall he whole, and by and by his garment once touched the flyxe
stayed, and the woman perceived that the health of her body was restored. But
Jesus willing such a notable exaumple of faith not to be hid, and teaching
withal that the glory of God ought not to be conceled: to then tent he would
have the benefit to be confessed, he turns unto ye multitude saying, who
touched me? When all denied it: Yet sum body touched me (quod he:) For I feel
a power going out from me. Here Peter and the other disciples, not knowing what
Jesus mente, say: Lord thou see the thick multitude thrusting the on every
side, and do thou ask who touched the, since so many touch the? But when
Jesus, as ignorant who had touched him, looked about him as seking for the
privy toucher, the woman being only privy of the thing, perceiving that she
could not be hid from Jesus, al shame fastnes set apart, fearing and trembling,
fell down at Jesus feet, and confessed all the matter as it was, and what
disease she had, and how many years she had been sick, and how she had spent
al her substance in vain upon phisicio^s and how that she persuaded her self,
that by the only touching of the skirt of his garment, And wha^ he saw her,
etc.
she might be healed, and how by and by after the touching she felt perfect
health of her body. It was the will of Christ that these things should be
declared before the multitude, not to put the woman to shame, neither to
purchase himself praise of men: but by this example to teach all me^, what sure
confidence and trust is hable to do, and by the example of the woman to
establishe the faith of the warden of the Synagogue, which he perceived sumwhat
waueryng, and withal to reprove the Phariseis for their unbelief. Therefore
Jesus, lest he should seem to be angry, and to take away his benefit again,
comforted the woman trembling for fear, and said: my d^ughter be of good
comfort. Thy faith has obtained thee health. Depart in peace with a quiet and
a careless mind. Thy faith has saved the.
My will is that this benefit shall continue with the, though thou have stolen
it from me.

As Jesus was speaking these things, certain came from the wardens of the
Sinagoges house, and told him that his daughter was dead, and that there was
no cause why to trouble Jesus. For they took Jesus to be nothing else, but sum
notable physician, which was hable by his faculty to restore health to them
that were alive, but not to restore the dead to life. And therefore they
thought it but vain to call a physician, be he never so excellent, to a
dead man. Jesus perceiuyng that the father of the maid was much amassed with
this tidinges, comforted him, saying: Fear not, only have faith and trust that
the maid shall be whole, and she shall be whole. It is in thee, that thy
daughter may be whole. And now when they were cum to the warden of the Synagoges
house, Jesus suffered not the multitude to enter in, nor the other disciples,
beside Peter, James, and John, and the father and mother of the maiden. But al
her kinsemen and friends did weep, and after the country manner, they beat
their bodies, bewailing her, and criyng out, and such other things as men be
went to do very folishely in the funerals of rich men and great men. For the
maid is not dead but slepeth.
Jesus bad them cease from their wailing, for the maiden was not dead, but a
sleep. Meaning thereby that the maiden was dead, to them which could not
raise her, but unto him she slept only, to who^ it was more easy to raise her
from death, than to other to raise her from sleep. When the familiars and
friends of the warden perceived not these things, they laughed Jesus to
skorne, because they knew certaily that she was dead, seeing her wha^ she died:
Therefore after that he had thrust forth from the funerals the mourning
multitude, he taking the father and the mother of the maiden, entered into the
parler, where as the corpse of the maiden did lie. And Jesus taking the virgin
by the hand, said: Maide^ arise. And furthwith when at the word the maiden
rose, she walked also, that ye faith of the miracle might be the more certain.
For he did not only restore life suddenly, but also strength and cherefulnes.
And when the parents of the maiden were greatly amassed, he gave the^ in
commandment, and desired them instantly to tell no body what was done: both
that he might avoid the suspicion of vain glory, (for this chiefly ought to be
done with the heads of the S^nagoge, which did al things possible to obtain
the praise of men:) and also that they might show forth with greater faith, and
credit ye thing that was done, if they commanded to keep silence, yet would
needs tell the things that they had seen done, to the Phariseis and to the
Prelates of the Synagoge. For he knew the disposicion of man, which he minded
to use to the profit of others. And when he departed, he badde them give the
maide^ meat, using the part of a phisicio^, making as though it had been no
miracle, which thing established the faith of the miracle the more.

thou son of David have mercy on us. And when he was cum into the house, the
blind came to him, and Jesus says unto the^: believe ye that I am hable to do
this? They said unto him: Lord, we believe. Then touched he their ^yes, saying:
according to your faith, be it unto you. And their iyes were opened. And Jesus
charged them, saying: see that no man know of it. But they when they were
departed, spread abroad his name in all that land. Now when Jesus left the house
of the warden of the Sinagoge and returned to his own house: two blind men
followed him, which had heard the fame of his miracles, and thereof conceived an
hope to obtain health, especially hearing of his goodness toward al men, were
they never so mean. But when they could neither see Jesus, nor cum unto him,
yet with a loud cry for love of health, and for feruentnes of faith, far of
they cry upon Jesus, with gentle prayer, saying: O son of David have mercy
upon us. Jesus in the way answered them nothing, differring his benefit, that
the miracle might be the more manifest: endeavoring always to allure y^ Jews to
faith, and by the very things many ways to reprove ye Phariseis unbelief. The
captain had faith and trust, the woman had faith and trust, they that carried
the man sick of the palsy, did believe and trust, the Jews and Phariseys did
distrust, and were also full of malice and envy. But wha^ Jesus was cum home,
the blind men were received into his house, who with stiff hope followed him.
Than Jesus geuyng exaumple unto others, first demanded them of their faith:
Believe ye (quod he) that I am hable to perform your requests? And they
without any delay, Believe ye that I am hable to do this*
said: Lord we believe. Than Jesus touching their iyes with his hand, said:
As ye believe so be it to you, not chale^ging to him self the restoryng of the
sight, but imputyng it to their faith and trust, declaryng that chiefly
unbelief made us unmeet for the bountyfulnesse of God, which is pressed and
ready for all men. Assoue as Jesus had spoken, the iyes of the blind were open,
so that they saw clearly. Here Jesus willing to warn us covertly, that
although glory of it self follows the good deed yet we must flee it rather
then desire it: he charged the blind men very earnestly, that no man should
know this deed. But the ioying of their new felicity, spread the fame of
Jesus the more through out the whole country: among all them that knew of
their old blindness.

When the blind were departed, there was an other miserable manne offered unto
him, who was vexed with a devil, which took away the use of his tongue, that
the man neither was well in his wit to wish for health, nor had no tongue to ask
for it. He therefore because he had need of an other man's faith, was offered
unto Jesus. Which without any tarriyng cast out the devil, and furthwith the
dumme spoke. The multitude marueiling at so great spedines of miracles, He
casts out deuels through the prince of devils.
ready in all kind of diseases, being never so incurable, said among them
selves. There was never manne among the Israelites, that wrought so many
miracles to easily. Contrariwise ye Phariseis blinded daily with malice more
and more, where as the things that were done in the sight of all men could
not be denied, yet to the ente^te they might withdraw from him the minds of
the people that had him in veneracion, they falsely slander him, that he
casts out devils not by the power of god, but by the might of Beelzebub the
prince of devils. Tha^ which untrue slander, what could be a more mad thing?
As who should say one devil drives out an other, or as who should say,
Beelzebub the enemy of mankind, gave life to the dead, health to the sick,
sight to the blind, speech to the dum. These illes cum from them oftentimes,
which Jesus of his goodness having compassion upon me^ took away, with such
corporal benefits, as might se^sibly be perceived, preparing them for the
capacity of spiritual benefits. But most meke Jesus was not offended with such
malicious reproach, but devised more for the health of all men, because he saw
the Phariseis, (to whom it apperteyned to see for the health of the people)
so little to help and succor, that also they enuyed the commodities of
others. Jesus therefore as a good shepeherde walked thorough al cities and
streets, laboring to heal both the souls and bodies of all men, teaching in
their co^gregacions, and preaching the kingdom of heaven (into the which none
be received, but such as be void of all diseases of the soul) and healing
also al kinds of diseases and sickenesses.

Further when Jesus saw the multitude swarming on every side, and every day
more thick, and now gredy of health and sincere doctrine, and co^nsidered
withal, that the Priests, Phariseis, and Scribes, upon who^ the people
hitherto did hang, to do any thing rather then to preserve the people, and that
they were whole given not to the g^ory of God, but to their own glory, to
their own lucre, to their own belly, and to their own pleasures, in who^ if
there were any religion it was but colored and counterfaited, so that it was
very noisome unto true religion: and considered also that the people was but
rude and gross, and yet in the way of amendment, for they lokyng to be healed
in their bodies, followed with a simple and plain faith, and glorified god:
and although yet they understood not the doctrine of the gospel, yet they did
not reject the same. Contrariwise when he considered the Phariseis and the
Scribes, where as they had the Prophets and the law, yet to be blinded with
worldly desires, and also to resist the doctrine of ye gospel: the good
shepeherde was moved with pity and compassion, He was moved with compassion on
them.
because he saw them like unto wanderyng sheep, skatered a sunder and destitute
of a shepherd, and running unadvisedly hither and thither. Jesus therefore
co^sideryng that in the Phariseis, which played the wolves rather than the
shepherds, the flock had no hope, and that the people through miracles was
now sumwhat prepared to receive the doctrine of the gospel, he said unto his
disciples, whom he had now well gathered together: The harvest is plenteous but
the laborers ar few.
I see a great harueste, but very few laborers. The fame of ye gospel is spread
abroad euerywhere. The feruencie of many is stirred up, which seem ripe and
ready to hear the wisdom of the gospel. But where be they that will take upon
them to preach and teach? Where be they that will teach purely and
sincerely, neither sekyng after glory of man nor after gain and lucre, but
teaching so sincerely as ye see me teach?

Truly such a cumpany of men must not be neglected, being kindeled with the
desire of the heavenly doctrine. What is than to be done, but to desire and
require the lord of the harvest, to thruste into his harueste the idle and
unwilling laborers. For the occasion is now, and lingeryng is dangerous. I
know that it is more pleasant for you to be with me, but the time is at hand,
that ye must show some proof of your selves, and that ye must begin to show
forth for the salvation of other, that which ye have received of me.

The.x. Chapter.

Therefore Jesus going up upon the hill, commanded his disciples which
specially followed him, to cum unto him. Of these he ordained twelve to be
chief, unto whom as to the better learned and more strong, he commits with
anthoritie, the office of teaching, that according to thexaumple that they saw
in their master, they should teach the people, each in so^dry places. And
lest the doctrine of fishers, unlearned and abiecte men, should forthwith be
despised, he gave them also power against all unclean spirits, to cast them
out with the word, and to heal all kinds of diseases, and all faults of the
body, He gave them power against unclean spyrites.
that whatsoever Christ did before them in the fathers name and his own, that
they should do in the name of Jesus Christ, in whose room they were. For so
Jesus entered, that through healing of grievous and incurable diseases, (which
benefit seems unto men most godly) he might allute the rude and the simple to
the things of the soul. But lest any manne should take false Apostles for
the true, these be the names of the twelve whom Christ himself did ordein.
First Simon the son of John, which also was called Peter, and his brother
Andrewe: For these were the first that Christ called. Secondly James the son
of zebedei with John his brother: Thirdly Philip and Bartilmew. Fourthly Thomas
whose surname was Didimus, and Matthew the Publicane. Fifthlye James the son
of Alphe, with Judas the son of James, which also was called Lebbeus or
Thaddeus. Sixthly Simon the Carianite, which was also called zelotes, and Judas
Iscarioth, which afterward betrayed his master. By such manner ambassadoures
being poor men, rude, abject, fishers, sinners and men not known, and of no
reputacion, Christ went about to tourn and renew the whole world unto the
wisdom of the gospel: lest in this praise the world might attribute any
thing unto it self, if he had begone this heavenly purpose by men of
learning, of power, of tyches, or of nobility.

to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Go^ and preach, saying: the
kingdom of heaven is at hand. Deal the sick, cleanse the leapres, raise the
dead, cast out devils. Freely ye have received, give freely: Possess not
gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, nor yet scrippe toward your
journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet a todde: For the workman
is worthy of his meat. Now it is worthy the hearing, to hear what he
commanded them, and how he furnished these ambassadors in their journey. And
first of all he appoints them the coasts and limittes of preaching, and
forbids the^ to go out of Iewry, and forbids them to go either to the
people that were next, or unto the cities of the Samaritanes, whom the Jews
did abhor, not that Jesus did count any kind of men to be abhorred, but lest
he should seem to be offended with the injuries of the Phariseis, and for
reue^ging of him self, to send his disciples unto strangers: or lest he
might give occasion unto the Jews, to excuse themselfes, and say that they
were despised, and that the Gentiles and Samaritanes were preferred before the^.
But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel,
Again because he knew that the Jews chiefly would rebel against the gospel,
he would leave them no manner of excuse, but that it should appear unto al me^
that they were put from the kingdom of god, by their own frowardness, and
that the Gentiles were received by their own plain and simple faith. Therefore
(quod he) forbear them for a time, and go rather to the lost sheep of the
nation of Israel, that they may repent to be saved. For they be not all of the
Phariseis malice, there be sheep among them, erryng by simplicity and
ignorance, which being monished and taught will fone repent, and hear the
voice of the good shepeheard. And ye shall begin your preaching thus, like as
ye saw me do. For it is not mete nor expedient forth with to disclose the
secret mysteries unto ye rude people: Go and preach saying: the kingdom of
heaven is at hand.
they must be made in a readiness before, that they may be hable to receive the
heavenly doctrine. First of al therefore preach nothing else, but that the
kingdom of heaven is at hand, that they retournyng from their old life, may
prepare themselves to a new life. For the first degree of righteousness, is to
abstain from sin. And the first degree to health, is to knowledge the
disease. Furthermore lest the teachers being men of no reputacion, and teaching
new things, should not be believed, make them believe your doctrine by
mi^^cles, like as ye saw me do, Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the
leprose, cast out devils. These things though they be very great, yet ye
shall have them of me, and they shall get you favor and authority withal
men. For first the weak must be allured. Take you head only tha^ ye do not
abuse these things either to vain glory, Freely ye have received, give
freely.
or to lucre. Like as ye have freely received of me, so freely give. Defyle not
the euangelical funccion, no not with the least suspicion of glory or lucre.
Thus men shall esteem you great in deed, if they shall see you of so great
might and power, and yet not to be haut nor proud, nor desirous of lucre, but
stoutly to despise those things, for the which the common sort of men, do and
suffer all that they may. I will have you light and ready to do this message,
and to be laded with no burdens, to be encombred with no carfulness, that ye
may whollye apply the office committed unto you. Ye teach heavenly things,
set not your care upon worldly things, ye have preparacio^ mete for your
preaching, which teaches no mean thing. Wherefore when you take your journey
burdeyn not your purses with gold nor silver. No carrye not so much as a
bag abou^e with you to put your vitayles in, neither.ii. coats, nor shoes
nor staff. He is well armed which is gyrded with the sweard of the word of the
gospel. Nor ye shall not need to be careful, For the work man. etc.
how ye being naked shall come by necessaryes. Only be careful in your office
committed unto you, and all these shall be given you from your heavenly father.
It is his matter that ye have in hand. He will not suffer his workmen to be
defrauded of their hyer. For them that live from day to day, and according to
nature, necessaries be soon prepared. And there will be ynowe which of
themselves will give to you, doing and teaching such things. So shall it come
to pass, that neither ye shall be troubled with such cares which may
diminishe your authority, and make you to be suspected, nor they whom ye
teach, shall be unkind toward you, of whom they receive far greater
things.

And ye shall be grieuouse to no man with begging, nor no man shall cast you
in the teeth with his benefit, because he has made a change for better
things rather than given any thing. For it shall not be needful for you to
turn into common innes, but into what city or street you enter into, first
inquire if there be any honest man there, desyrouse of the heavenly kingdom,
and weary of the world, which with godly desires sygheth now and than after
Messiah that was promised, which shows a great hope of greater increase, by
simplicity and innocence of life, by liberality toward the poor. For such
one will be a very mete host for you, and again ye shall be meet gestes for
him. When ye have found such an one, turn into his house, and change not
your inn, until your business about the gospel, And there abide till ye go
thence*
causes you to remove into another city. For it shall not be nedeful neither
comely for you, oftentimes to change your host, as light persons, or persons
desyrouse of more deynty fare. Every house, every fare, ought to suffyse for
men of the gospel. Be ye courteous and gentill of manners, that ye appear
neither proud, nor ^atterers. When ye enter into the house, speak first and
say: Peace be in this house. Your prayer shall not be in vain. For if the
house be worthy this prayer, by and by without delay it will receive it: but
if it refuse it, your salutacion shall not be lost. For that which they
despise shall return unto you. And truly I would not have you bowyng, and
becking, or flatteryng any man for your necessities, that if any house think
much to receive you, or if any city think much to have you as geastes, and
will not of their own accord receive the salvation of the gospel offered
unto them, I will that ye shall leave the house which ye saluted, and leave
the city whereunto ye entered, and go into the streets and shake of the dust
from your feet, declaryng openly that ye hunt for none of their worldly
commodities, who cast of the gospel of God, insomuche that ye shall not be
cast in the teeth with the vile duste that sticks upon your feet. Here have
in remembrance, that an holy thing must not be given to dogs, nor precious
margarites cast unto hogs.

Only see that ye lay this to the unkind, will they, nyll they, that the
kingdom of god is at hand to the great commodity of them that receive it,
and to the great hurt of them that refuse it. Auyse them which receive the
word of the gospel. Woe be to that city, wherein none shall be found, that
does repent him of his ill life, and desires not to be amended. This I assure
you, that the country of Sodom and Gormorre shall be more gently handled in the
day of judgment, than that city, though it be a city of Israel. The more
that the clemency of god is to provoke them to penance, by so many miracles,
and so many benefits, the more grievously shall they be punished, if they
reject it.

But leave ye the punishment of them to god, be ye meke and pacient against all
injuries, and so endeavor to profit all good men, that when ye be provoked of
ill men, ye requi^e not injuries. It is sufficient for you to be garnished
with those things, wherewith ye may do good to all men. Against the injuries
of men I will have you utterly without weapon, and to overcome with none other
defense but with sufferaunce. Otherwise I could make you terrible and to be
feared, but it is not expedient for the gospel. For violence does not
extinguishe violence, Behold I send you forth.
nor injury injury, nor pride pride, but rather couldnes, gentilnes, and
quietness. I know that the phariseis, and men that ^e stout with the succoure
of this world, will go about to do you sore displeasures. But against all these
there is none other buckeler but patience. Nor there is no cause to fear, ye
be sent like sheep without weapon, simple, innocent, in the mids of wolves,
but ye be sent of me. I would not that ye being provoked by their naughtines,
should he turned into wolves, but to go about this by all means, that the
wolves assuaged by your gentylnes, may be turned into sheep. It is no great
matter to revenge ill men, but to turn their hertes to good, is a very great
and an hard matter. Therefore ye must couple two certain things together, the
policy of the serpente, and the simplicity of the dove. The simplicity of the
dove shall cause you to desire to do good to al men, and to hurt no man, no
though ye be provoked. The policy of the serpente, shall cause you to give none
occasion, whereby your doctrine might be reproved. This is the chief point of
your ambassade, that the gospel may enter into all men's hearts. Therefore ye
must do utterly nothing, but beware of those me^.
which by any probable color might withdraw any man's heart from the doctrine
of the gospel. Your doctrine shall make great stirs and tumultes in the
world, the more therefore ye must beware, lest any business arise through
your defaulte. Which can not be, if ye communicate your benefits freely unto
all men, and keep patience also toward the ill men, and desire to do them
good.

Therefore with such manner of men, yea wolves rather, ye must work warelye,
and now prepare your mind against all kinds of ill, that nothing may trouble
you, when it shall happen. For the time shall come that they will pluck you as
ill doers into their counsels and conuentycles, and beat you with whippes like
ungracious men, and subuerters of public weal, ye shall be brought before
rulers and kings, not for your deserts, but for my sake, and though I may let
them, yet will I suffer all these things to be done, that it may be witnessed
and open to all men, that they peryshe through their own default, which being
moved and provoked by so many miracles, by so many benefits, by so ready
doctrine, by your simplenes and gentilnes, so spitefully reject salvation
offered unto them. Therefore when so few shall be brought furthe to so many, so
weak and unarmed to so mighty, so unlettered to so learned, be not careful
how ye shall plead your cause, though ye be rude, and not skillful of
judgments, of laws, and of the law place. Also I would not ye should run to
such aid and succor, by the which the common sort of men be wont to have
the higher hand in judgments. They take unto them a cunning and a well tonged
advocate, they flatter the judges, they fall down humblye upon their knees,
they get favor with money. For it shall be given you etc.
Meddle ye with none of these. Do ye this only, go forth when ye be called,
answer when ye be commanded, that they have no just cause of co^tumacy and
stubbernes against you: but answer plainly and boldly, not with a devised and
a prepared oracion, but with such one as has boldness joined with wisdom and
mildnes. Like as vitayle shall be ready for you in every place: so speech
shall be given unto you, upon which carefully to muse, appertains not to him
that depends wholly upon the help of god. Yea speech shall be given unto them
in season which muse nothing upon it, not garnished nor gaye, but wise and
effectual, and meet for the gospel. It is not man's matters that ye have in
hand, but gods, whereof ye be not authors, but instruments. For it is not ye
that shall speak there, but the spirit of your father speaks by your
mouths.

Trusting therefore upon his help, ye must be moved by no storms of
adversity. For the world will arise against my doctrine with such tumulte
and business, But he that endures to the end shall be saved.
that the brother forgetting his brotherly love, will bring his brother to
death: yt the father forgetting his natural love, will put his son in
daungier of death: that the son all honor and duty set aparte, will rise
against the father, and mother, and put them to death, of whom he had the
beginning of his life. Briefly ye shall be hated of all men, for the hatred
they bear to my name. For this world being so corrupt on every side with
ambicion, pride, avarice, lechery and other worldly desires, will not bear the
heavenly doctrine contrary to his appetite and desire. And it shall be a
greater offense to be a Christian man, than to be a murderer of a sorcerer.
These hurly burlyes the devil shall raise against the gospel, but distrust
not, godly wisdom shall overcome the wyles of the devil, and the malice of
man: do ye the business committed unto you with a bold and cherefull courage.
For whosoever among these ylles does persevere and continue unto the end, he shall
be saved. For ye must not being discouraged with fear, leave of the business of
the gospel.

But when they persecute you in this city fly into another. The te^te.
For verelye I say unto you: ye shall not go through all the cities of Israel,
until the son of man be come. The disciple is not above his teacher, nor the
servant above his master: It is enough for the disciple to be as his teacher,
and the servant to be as his master: If they have called the good: man of the
house Beelzebub, how much more his householde servants? Fear them not
therefore. For there is nothing kept close, that shall not be opened, and
nothing hid that shall not be known. What I tell you in darkness, that speak
ye in light. And what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye on the house
tops. There is no peril unless a stomach meet and worthy for the gospel
fail you. But like as ye ought not to provoke the cruelty of ill men, nor
to stir up persecucion, nor resist it with might and power, so whilst the
preaching of the gospel is but new and young, I grant you liberty to avoid
danger and peril by flying and running away, not only that ye may be in
safety your self, but also that by this occasion the fame of the gospel
may be spread the further abroad. Therefore if they persecute you in one city,
give place to their madness and flee into another, so that in no wise at a little
injury of persecucion, ye cease from your labor in the gospel. This only
is to be done now, that the fame of the gospel may be spread throughout all
Palestine. And in this the persecutor shall do you good, because he shall not
suffer you to tarry long in one place. The disciple is not above his master.
etc
The time shall come when ye shall not avoid persecucion with flight. Now the
time is short, and haste must be made. For the kyndome of god is at hand.
This I assure you, before that ye have goen over all the cities of Iewry, the
son of man will show himself, and will help you being in danger. An
exaumple shall be showed you in him how great adversities the preachers of the
gospel must suffer. The which all ought to seem unto you the more
tolerable for this, that ye se that I have suffered al manner of reprofes and
affliccions. The scholar is not better than his master, nor the servant
better than his lord. This suffiseth to the scholar if he be equal with his
master: This ought to suffice the servant, if he be equal with his lord.
If they have so unworthily checked me the father of the house, insomuche that
in most vile reproach they called me Beelzebub, and named the son of God by
the name of an unclean devil: Fear them not therefore
what marvel is it, if they be bold upon the servants of the house? I
know that infamy seems a great ill, and almost more grievous than death: but
it is a praise and no infamye, which cummeth of wicked men for the gospel
sake. They will say that ye be witches, ill doers, and sedicious, but this
ignominy and shame afterward shall be turned into glory. Your sincerity and
innocence at length shall appear unto the world, which sincerity all men
shall praise, cursing them which have dishonested you with false report.
Praise long suppressed, breaks out commonly with greater light. There is
nothing covered but time will uncover it, For there is nothing. etc
and nothing is hid, but it once will come to light. Endeavor this only, that
ye do things worthy praise, and not seek after praise. There is nothing
therefore, why ye should be troubled with fear of infamy, and not freely preach
the gospel of the kingdom. It has no dishonest thing, nor nothing to be kept
close. Yea if ye hear any thing of me in darkness, preach ye it in the clear
light. And if I have told any thing secretly, preach it openly. Our doctrine
is without any coloring. It desires to come forth before all men; and it is
afraid to be known of no man

and all the hears of your head be nu^bred: Fear ye not therefore: ye be of
more value than many sparowes Every one therefore that shall confess me before
men* him will I confess also before my father which is in heaven. But
whosoever deui^^^ me before men, him will I also deny before my father which is
in heaven. But there shall be some perchance, which will little pass upon
infamye, and other ylles, but who can despise and set little by death? It were
mete you should fear them, if they could kill the whole man: but ye that know
that the body is the vilest part of man, and that the soul which is the
chief part of man cannot be hurt of them, be they never so savage and
cruel: Ye (I say) need not to fear them. They should hurt you more if they
did not sley you following their minds, than if they kill you not regardyng
them. I will show you who is more to be feared. Fear him who like as he made
ye whole man, so he is able to condemn him to everlasting death, and to
deliver him into hell fire.

Yet the body which the tiranne does kill for a time, does not utterly
peryshe. For the self fame at the resurreccion shall be restored in far better
wise. Hitherto therefore only the body is in danger, if in case ye be killed
constantly obeying my commandments. But if ye obey their commandments,
and leave the bus^^^s of the gospel, now not only the body does peryshe,
which if no man kill it, yet by the common law of nature it must needs dye,
but also the soul shall be delivered to everlasting fire. And what matter is
it, whether the persecutor, or disease, or any other chance take away the
life? Truly more glorious it is to die for the gospel sake, which death
though it be violent and sore, yet it shall not come before the day,
whansoeuer it cummeth it shall not come without the providence of God. And by
this it cummeth to pass, that if ye endeavor to avoid it, ye cannot. God will
not suffer you to be slain but when it shall be very expedient for you to die.
Wherefore put out of your minds all this fear. God also will provide for this,
to whom it were not hard to give you immortality, but that it is a greater
thing to despise death, than to escape it. What is of less value than
sparrowes? of the which two be bought for a farthing, a very little coin? And
the number of sparrowes is great in every place, and yet not so much as one of
them is lost in the earth, but by the will and sufferaunce of your father.
Do ye fear than lest he will suffer you, whom among all he has chosen to
this business, to perish before your time, whom he does not neglecte,
insomuche that he keeps the number of all the hears of your head? Seeing that
ye be of more estimacion to the father than innumerable sparrowes, there is no
cause why ye should fear, lest men be able to do any thing against you,
otherwise than shall be thought to him, who has continual care over you.
Wherefore leave the care of your life and death unto him, and be not ye driven
from the open profession of my name, be it never so hated of the world, by any
fear of displeasures that men can do unto men. For whosoever little regarding
the rebukes of men, do profess me in this life to be his Lord and master,
him will I acknowledge to be my servant and disciple, before my heavenly
father. Contrarywyse whosoever will be ashamed of me before men and deny me,
him will I deny before my father which is in heaven. And this is no daynteouse
and delicate profession, for he does not profess, me unless he does declare
by his life that he does believe my sayings.

And he has denied me which so lives that he sets by any sayng more than
by me. What winning therefore can it be, if a maune lose that noble and
everlasting praise with the father and his angels, for fear of a false
slander hece, which neither lasts long, nor is no slander in deed but with
ignorant and folyshe men, and before God very true glory? It is a great
gain little to pass upon these things, and to make haste to the everlasting
reward: which shall be given in due time to them that have deserved it: in the
mean season a good conscience is a great piece of the reward.

The profession of the gospel is no weriche nor light thing. Truly the
rewards be great, but ye must come unto them with vehement and continual
desires of the mind: they chance not unto ill men and lingerers: they must
be obtained by strength and violence. Think ye that I am cumme to so we peace
in the earth among men? It is far otherwise. Nay I am not come to sow peace
and concord, but swearde and war^e, and that inward and domestical war,
and not civil war only.

For where as the doctrine of the gospel shall be hated of the most part,
and since it requires so feruente a desire toward it, that all the affeccions
of men be they never so great and unruly, must give place: it cannot be but
great strife and dissencion must arise among the^ that be most nere and
frendely: whiles they that do^e upon the world will rage rather against their
derest beloved, than forsake their vices, whereunto they be accustomed: and
whosoever is once touched with the great feruencye of the evangelical charity, he
will not suffer himself by no manner of affeccions to be plucte away from the
thing, which he has begoonne to embrace and make much of. But happy is that
strife and dissencion which does auaunce sincere and good things, and
cutteth away rotten things: Happy is that swearde which pareth away from
the soul all noisome lusts and desires. Let this tumulte and hurly-burly be
laid unto me, and not to you, which have given a medicine and troubled all
the body: but so, that they that strive against their beloved, that is to say
their nerest kinsfolks, for the hatred of my name, ought to impute it to
themselves and not to me. For they might follow them whom they persecute. I
offer health and salvation to all men, which if all men do embrace, there shall
be no strife nor dissencion. Truly the gospel of it self is a thing of
peace, and of quietness, but sedicion is raised by the fault of others: Like as
the medicine is a wholesome thing of it self, but in the body it makes a
rumblyng and trouble, whiles it provides that all the members may be in quiet.
For I am come. etc.
But it is expediente that the noisome things be pared away, that true and
holy concord may be established the more among the pure and clean. This
sweard therefore I bring into the earth to break concord betwixt the son and
the father, to divide the sure and straight band of nature between the
daughter and the mother, to disceuer the love and concord between the mother
and daughter in law. There is no knot of nature or amity so sure, which this
sword is not able to break. He that loves father or mother. etc.
Whom domestical acquaintance has made lovers and very nere friends, them
the sword of the gospel shall set in sundre. But so far and no ferther
shall this batrayle extend, and so far shall this war go, that they which
be of our side shall only despise their enemies, but not hurt them, and
as much as in them lies, save them also if they can* And thus far shall this
despising go, not to disgayne them and abhor^e them, but soberly to make them
an answer, and not to obey their wicked commandments. Ye must take heed by
all means that the common state of the public weal be not troubled by you.
Be not slack in the duty which by the law of nature the son owes to the
father, the daughter to the mother the brother to the brother, the husband to
the wife, the cosen to the cosen, the friend to the friend, and the familiar to
his familiar, and acquaintance. For I do not abrogate and put away the law
of nature, but make it perfect. Ye must be obediente in all things unto the
public magistrates and ministers, unless they prescribe and command wicked
things. They call you to the law, ye must go they require an account, ye
must make it: but if they command you to do honor and sacrifice to images
and pictures, if they command you to cease from preaching of my name, ye
ought not to obey them. And yet they must not be stirred with checkes and
railinges, but they must be answered soberly; why it is more mete to obey God
the prince over all, than the power of man. For it is reason that the
commandments of God should be preferred before the commandments of men.
And if they prescribe unjust things which yet do not make men wicked if they
obey them, they must be suffered, lest they being stirred they fall into a
rage. As for an exaumple, if they take away unjustly thy garment or money: if
they cast thee into prison: if they scourge thee with whippes. For these
things do not take away godliness, but rather by occasion, increase and set
forth the virtue of the gospel. Likewise the duty of the natural love must
be performed to the parent if he have need, though he be an heathen, and
alienate from the gospel. But if the authority of the parent withdraw from
the gospel, the heavenly father ought more to be obeyed, than the yerthly
father. And yet the father must not be churlishly despised, but gently and
reverently monished, not to repung against God. In like manner also we must do
with other, unto whom we owe the duty of humanity, either of nature or else of
curtesy. Some will say, it is heard to master such affeccions, which nature
has inwardly graffed in us. But such strong and manly men, the profession
of the ghospel does require, and such as will be moved from the heavenly
busynes by none affeccions. Ye shall see me go this way: he must needs follow
in the same which will be taken in the number of my disciples. The son that
loves the father or the mother more than me, is not mete for me. Again the
father which loves the son or the daughter more than me is not mete for me.
And he loves him more than me, if in doing him pleasures, he neglects my
commandments. It is wicked love so to tender thy parents being but men,
that thou offend thy parent being God. And lest it should seem to be much to
set more by the will of God than all men's affeccions, whereas nothing is more
dear to man than life, except he despise this also for the gospel sake, and
be always in a redines to all kinds of death and punishmente, and take up his
cross and follow me daily, He that finds his life. etc.
he is no mete disciple to have me to his master. For like as the disordered
love of the parent or child, is hatred rather than love, since it is noisome
unto both: so the disordered care to preserve the life, is a very destruction
of the life. He has preserved his life, that lost it well, he has lost it,
which has kept it naughtily. He that by forsakyng the ghospel, and denying me,
has pacified the judge, has escaped prison, has escaped ha^ging, has
escaped death, whereas he seems to men to have won his life, And he that
loses his life. etc.
he has lost his life in deed. Again he that constauntly stickyng unto the
gospel puts forth himself boldly to all dangers and deaths, he seems
unto men to loose his life, where in deed he wins his life. The life does
not perish when it is taken away for professing of the gospel but is
preserved euerlastyngly: It does perish in deed, if it bargayne to have a
short tarrying in the body with ungodliness: and yet it lives not than in the
body, which lives in the hatred of God.

Neither is there any danger lest if it chance you to be forsaken of your
parents, kynnesfolkes, aliaunce, and friends, that there should be none to
give you houserowme and vittayle. The gifts wherewith I do adorn you, and
your innocencye, shall purchase you every where, houses, parents, children,
kinnesfolkes, and friends. For ye shall have so many children, as ye shall have
disciples. Like as there shall be ever some which will despise you and persecute
you: so there shall be ever some which will comfort you with an entiere and pure
affeccion. And as, albeit ye revenge them not, but wish them well, God in time
to come will grievously punish them, because he takes him self to be despised
when ye be despised: He that receives you receives me.
so to the others he will render a great reward for your sake, albeit ye
requyte them not. For God wills not that it should be imputed to you, but
unto himself, if any Gentilnes has been bestowed upon you for the gospels
sake. For whosoever receives you, receives me, in whose name ye be
ambassadoures: and he that receives me, receives my father, from whom I am
sent, and whose matter I have in hand.

He therefore like as he is rich and liberal, so will he render a very great
reward for every little benefit which is bestowed upon you, that men shall
not loose their benefit upon you, but have a great auantage thereby: yt much
more ought he to render thanks which gave the benefit, than he that received
it. For truly it is a great gain to exchange a corporal benefit induryng
but a while, for spiritual and everlasting riches. Whosoever receives the
Prophet or the preacher for no another co^sideracion but that he is a Prophet
or a preacher, and that he being sent from me preaches the will and promises
of God, he shall receive the reward of a Prophet, and become a Prophet
himself. And whosoever receives the just man not because he is his kinnesman, or
for any other worldely affeccion, but for this cause only that he is a just
and a good man, living after the rule of the gospel, he shall receive the
reward of the just, and become a just man himself. Has not he made an happy
change, which has used hospitality, and won innocencye? Poverty can
withdraw no man from this gain. For here the good will of the geuer is
counted the gift, and not the value of the gift. In somuche that whosoever gives
but a cup of cold water, I say not unto me, but unto any of the least of
these, only because he is my disciple, I say unto you, certainly he shall not
leese his reward: for he also shall become my disciple. And who is so poor
and bare which is not hable to give a cup of cold water to the thirstye?
And as it skilleth not how great the thing is that is given, but with what
affeccion and in whose name it is given: so it skilleth not how great he be,
upon whom this gentilnes is bestowed: this is sufficient that he is my
disciple, that I may except and take it for a great benefit.

The.xi. Chapter.

AFter that Jesus had instructed and furnyshed his disciples with these
commandments, and commissions to preach the gospel, he left them: that
they being aparte from their master, might make a trial of themselves, and
prove what they could do: and went from the hill, that he for his part might
preach the gospel in the cities of the Jews.

And at what time the fame of Jesus, by the reason of his miracles which he
wrought in many places, and by the reason of his wonderful doctrine, did
increase daily more and more throughout all Iewry, and in the countries nere
unto Iordane, where John before had preached and baptized Jesus: the disciples
of John somewhat now envying the glory of Jesus, of whom as yet they had no
great opinion, whereas of John they thought that he was somewhat more than
manne: they told unto John being in prison, what good success and fortune
came of all things which were done by him, whom a little before he had baptized
in Iordane, and with whom he did bear witness unto the people.

Further John a man of perfect holiness, rejoicing that it now came to pass
which he spoke before, that the name and opinion of himself, which was
greater than it was in deed, did decrease and diminishe, and the fame and
opinion of Jesus did daily increase and sprede abroad, perceiving also the
envious affeccio^s of his disciples, to the intent that he might heal their
weakness and abandone them from him and deliver them to Jesus: he chose out two
of them and sent them to Jesus, to say unto him in his name these words: Art
thou that Messiah, which was said should come, or art thou not he whom I
spoke of before, and do we yet look for an other? Thus did John, not that he
was in doubt, but to confirm and establyshe the minds of his disciples, and
thoroughly to abolyshe and put away the over great suspicion that they had of
himself, supposing him to be Christ. For if he should have denied that he was
Christ and should have repeted that which he had often spoken before that
Jesus is Messiah, his disciples would have imputed it unto humility: and the
more he should have humbled himself, the greater opinion would they have had
of him. But he knew that Jesus himself could best heal and cure this their
weakness. Go and show John again what ye have heard and seen.
They go unto Jesus and tell him what John commanded them. Jesus knowing that
the testimonye which is gathered of deeds, is more certain than that which
spryngeth of words, chiefly if a man testifies with himself, made none
answer at the first, but even before their face working many wonders, both
new, and which have not been heard of, healyng the sick, chasing away the
unclean spirits, restoryng the lame, giving sight to the blind, says unto
them: It needs not for me to show what I am. Only go and show unto John
what ye have seen with your iyes, and what ye have heard with your ears. The
blind receives sight, the lame walks, the lepers be cleansed, the deaf
hears, the demoniackes which be troubled with devils, be delivered, the dead
rise again: Finally according to the prophecy of Esaias, the poor and humble
does embrace the joyful tidinges of everlasting life, which the stout and
arrogant do despise. These works do declare sufficiently what I am. And
blessed is he, unto whose mind such great success of the gospel gives not
occasion of ill. Jesus spoke this also, notyng modestly the envy of John his
disciples, but in such wise that they should not be put to shame before the
multitude, but should know their fault secretly with themselves: temperyng
his answer by all means, both that he might avoid suspicion of arrogance,
and that the disciples might believe him the better, and also that he might
rather heal their affeccion, than openly to reprove them.

Then when they were departed, Jesus turnyng unto the multitude, lest they
should surmyse anythyng of John otherwise than were conuenyent, supposyng that
he demanded these things as though he had been in doubt himself, and not
rather to heal the weakness of his disciples: he began to setfurth the
praises of John very largely, but yet in such wise that he would not give him
the praise of Messiah, but the next praise only, and yet he would that John
his testimony concerning him, should be of weight. For it is expedient that
the people should have a very good opinion of John, which had testified so
notably of Jesus, that he was the son of God, that he was the lamb which
should take away the sins of the world, that it was he that should
baptize in fire and spirit. For neither vanity nor lying could be suspected
in such a man, as though he had falsely so praised Christ before: nor
waueryng or inconstancye, as though being changed afterward he should have
begone to doubt of Christ. Letter, o man (quod he) suspecte John of
inconstancy.

For if ye think him such a one that he will change his mind after the
manner of mutable men, What went ye out into wyldernes to see? etc.
and doubt of that thing which he before affirmed, for what cause did ye
lately flock together in wilderness to gase and look on? To see a reed shaken
with the winds? For such manner of man should he be, if he would now swerve
and dissente from himself, and should become much unlike unto himself. But
the continual hardness of his whole life, does lightly deliver him from this
suspicion. What I say, ran ye together in to wilderness for to see? Behold
they that we are soft clothing. etc
A man gayly appareled with silks? This was a sight nothing mete for
wilderness. For they that be clothed with fine lynnen and silks, be in kings
palaces, unto whom does agree excess and riot, and delicate living. And among
them inconstancye and flattery has place.

He that lives with locustes and wild honye, he that is clothed with Camels
hear, he that is gyrded with a letheren gyrdle, is not thus suspected nor
misdemed: And the familiarity of the kings court could not alter his order.
The prison does declare and show that he could not flatter. But it must
needs he some great specta^le and sight which drew you so thick into the
deserte. Therefore what came ye to behold? Any Prophet? for they be commonly
wunte to lead their lives in deserte.

Here truly ye be not frustrate of your hope: For ye have not seen only a
Prophet, but a more excellent thing than a Prophet. For it is he of whom
Malachias once prophesied, that he should come before Messiah as being now at
hand, that he should not only by his oracle and tent saying, promise him to
come long after, bu^ also point him with his finger to be at hand. Thus is
the prophecy: Lo says he, I send my Angel before thy face to prepare thy
way for thy cummyng at hand. I s^ye unto you. etc.
This I assure you, so great is the excellency of John, that none is greater
than he, among them all that has been borne of a woman: Yet he which is at
this present esteemed less of many in preaching of the gospel, only is
greater than he: for he promised not with doubtful prophecies, that Messiah
once should come, but he showed him, and appointed him now cumming, and
preached that the kingdom of heaven was now at hand. Hitherto the heavenly
doctrine was looked for, which the figures of the Patryarkes, which also the
oracles of the Prophets, had darkely promised. Now John so excited and
stirred the hearts of many to the desire of evangelical doctrine, From the
days of. etc
that from the beginning of his preaching unto this day, they break in unto
it through the violence of faith, both sinners and heathen people, and will
we, nill we, they pluck it, and rauishe it violently. They will no longer be
excluded, they will no longer be detayned in shadows and dark riddles of the
old law, perceiving that the light of the evangelical truth is at hand, and
that the thing is now present, which was showed and signified in the former
books, perceyuyng also that none other prophecy ought to be looked for,
touching Messiah that should come. For all the Prophets etc.
For all fygures, by the which the law poynted Messiah to come, and all
prophecies of the Prophets, which promised that Messiah should come, as soon
as Ihon came, left of to promise the thing to come. For it is folishnes to look
for the thing that is present, as though it were to come.

There is no more to do, but fervently and gredely to teach, and take that
which agreablyte the true sayings of the Prophets is now presently offered.
And to the intent that ye may plainly see that hereafter there is none other
Prophet which shall show you of Messiah to come, this is that John, whom
Malachias under Helias name (whom he followed in austeritie and hardenes of
living, and apparel, whom he followed also in frank reproving ^f kings)
prophesied before should come before that Christ did come. Wherefore if ye
receive him, believe ye that Messiah so long looked for, is now at hand: ye
have seen his life, ye have heard his testimony, ye hear also what I will
say unto you. If any have ears to receive the truth, let him hear: if any
will stop his ears, let him thank himself of his own undoing. There is
nothing omitted of us that may move the hearts of all men.

And yet I see many so obstinatly unbelieving, that neither afraid by the
austeritie of John, nor allured by my curtesye and well doing, will receive the
thing which they have looked for now so long time, by the promise of the
Prophets. What manner of generation shall I call this? Or by what comparison
may I set it forth? It is like unto children sytting in the market place,
which with a common song cry thus to their fellows a far of: we have song
you plesaunt things upon our pypes, and ye have not daunced: we have song you
sorrowful things, and ye have not wayled. We have proved and assayed one
thing, but diverse ways. Neither way has been profitable unto the unbelievers,
sower and intractable. John minding to stir up this nation unto penance, (as
it were with a sorowfull^ song) came forth with great austeritie and hardness of
life, fasting, abstayning from all delicate meats, forbearyng wine, and
drynkyng water. And some let not to say that he is possessed with the
devil, The son of man. etc.
so far they be from following of him. The son of man came forth minding to
stir up this nation to the love of the heavenly doctrine, as it were with a
more merye song of the pypes* and that he myg^t allure them the more with his
gentilnes, he hides not himself in deserte places, nor wears no notable
rough garment, nor uses no notable sower meats, but framing himself to all
men, and despising the cumpanye of no man, eats all manner of meats, and
drinks whatsoever is set before him: and ^gayne they pick quarrels, falsely
to reprove him, saying: Behold the great eater, the wine bibber, the friend of
the publicanes and sinners. They that be not moved with austeritie and
roughnes, he wont to be won by fair speaking and gentilnes. But this nation
by every occasion is made wurse, and turns every remedy and medicine into a
matter of greater disease and sickness. But by the more ways they be provoked
to health and salvation, the more evident it shall be to all men, that they
perish through their own malice: and the wisdom of God, by whose council
all these things be done, shall have the praise of righteousenesse among her
children, when they shall see them that appeared great men and just men
before the world, to be repelled from the kingdom of heaven for their
unbelief: contrarywyse when they shall see sinners, Publycans, harlottes,
heathen people, humble and abject, to be received into everlasting salvation
for the redines of their faith.

Here Jesus musyng in manner at the invincible malice of certain people, Woe be
to the Chorazin.
for the fear and example of others, began to rebuke the cities, which where
as he had showed many miracles, and healed men, and taught so many things: yet
they were not styrred to repentance of their former life, saying: Woe be to
the Chorazin: woe be to the Bethsaida: for if the wonders which have been
showed in you, had been seen in Tire and Sydon, which cities ye abhor as
heathen and wicked, long ago they being contryte would have done penance in
heerclothes and ashes. And in the mean time ye stand in your own conceyte,
because ye be of the flock of Israel, Woe be to thee Bethsaida.
because ye sacrifyce not unto Idolles, because ye be not given to riot and
excess so openly and loocely, because ye wurship one God, because ye be the
children of Abraham, because ye have the law and the Prophets: but unless ye
repent you, all these things shall turn into the heap of your damnacion.
For this I assure you, in the day of gods judgment when every man shall be
judged of God, not after opinion and hearesaye, but according to his diserte:
Tyrus and Sydon shall be more gentely handled than you. They shall be the more
easily punyshed, because they were not styrred to repentance as ye be. And
thou, o Capernaum, which now standing in thine own conceyte, art in courage
as high as heaven: shall than be pl^cked down to hell. But I say^ unto you.
etc.
Thou reioysest with thy self as though thou were ryghteous and do abhor
the dwellers of Sodom which in time paste were horriblye punished for their
sins: but in the day of judgment their da^nacion shall be more easy than
thine. For if those miracles had been wrought in Sodom which have been showed
in thee, they would have satisfied by penance, God that was offended with
them, and their cities had stand unto this day.

And when the disciples were returned unto Jesus from their preaching, and told
him cherfully that the matter came well to pass, he teaching us that
whatsoever we do praise worthy ought to be ascribed unto God, lifting his iyes
up to heaven, said: I thank thee, o father, which art Lord of heaven and
yerth, and by whose wisdom all things be governed, because thou haste hyd
this heavenly philosophy from them that be high minded and puffed up with
pride, through an opinion of their worldely wisdom and polycie: and haste
opened it to the little ones, and to the meke, and to fools after the worlds
judgment. Truly so it is father, for so it is thought best unto thy
gentilnes: to teach that thou art not pleased with the stout, and such as
trust unto their own justice and wisdom: and that they be great with the,
for the simplicity of faith, whom the world takes for fools and abiectes.
So it pleased thy godly wisdom, Uerely father so it was. etc.
to condemn the wisdom of man, and to draw unto thee good men by the
humility of the doctrine evangelical. And by and by turnyng to them that
stood about him, said: My father is the author and the cause of all these
good things, who has delivered all unto me. To know him and me, is the very
true felicity. And he does not bow himself but to quiet and meke minds.
This is a certain secret Philosophy and not known unto the world. No man
knows the son but the father: no man knows the father but the son,
and to whom the son will manifest him: and he does not manifest him to the
proud and high minded. The doctrine avails nothing, the miracles avails
nothing, without the secret inspiracion. But none be worthy of this, but they
which distrusting their own helps commit themself wholly to the goodness of
God. They that think themselves wise, be not worthy for this wisdom. They
that think themselfes rich, be not received to these riches. They that think
themselfes noble and myghtie, be not received to these priuities. They that
think themselfes just, be not mete to receive the justice of God.

Here Jesus considering in his mind the great miserye and calamity of
mankind, some to be opressed with poverty, again some more grievously to be
tormented with care for riches, some to be grieved with diseases, some with old
age, some to be vexed with love, and some more grievously troubled with hatred,
many to wander and waver in sundry mazes of false opinions, many to be
afflicted and grieved inwardly with the conscience of their sins, and that
there was none, which played the part of a faithful and effectual pastor,
whereas there were innumerable which t^ke upon them to be priests in
countenance and hawtie behauioure, which magnified themselfes by the name of
master and Rabby, and which did exact their tithes: moved with pity and
compassion does inuit and call unto him all men, promisyng of his own
accord unto all men, comfort and remedy, so that with a syngle and sincere
heart, they cumme unto him, and shaking of the most miserable and most
grievous yoke of the world, take upon them the yoke of the doctrine
evangelical.

Cumme unto me (says he) as many of you as be grieved with affliccions,
cares, or with conscience of your sins, and as many as be oppressed with the
burden of adversity, I will refreshe you, I will give you solace and comfort
against all kinds of displeasures. And I will ease you.
Neither riches, nor honors, nor pleasures of this world, brings the true
tranquillity and quietness of mind: nor the wisdom of this wordle, nor the
religion of the Phariseis delivers from greuouse carefulnes. The world has
his yoke, at the first apperaunce pleasant, but in deed greuouse and sharp.
First of all shake it of, and run unto me gladly, and bow your necks
cherefully under my yoke. Learn of me what thing only and truly does pacifye
and ease the mind, and of what fountain this whole cumulie and trouble of
men does spryng. Truly this is the hawte and fyerce mind trusting to it
self, and trustyng little to God. Out of this spryngeth Ambicion, desire of
money, lust to revenge, debate, envy, war, sedicion, wickedness against God:
than the which things what can be more tinmultuous or troublesome? So that
if ye will be once delivered from all illes, take away the fountain of these
euyls, receive my doctrine, and follow my life. Learn of me how that I am
meke and of no hawte heart. For I am meke and lowly of heart.
I have declared by miracles what I can do, and yet I desire neither riches,
nor honor, and I am ambicouse and gredy utterly upon nothing which seems to
the world great and goodly. I disdain none be he never so vile or sinful. I
give not taunte for taunte: I curse not them that wyshe me ill: I stryke not
him again, that stryketh me: I depend wholly of the commandment of my
father. He will punish the ill doers: he will reward the good deeds: to him I
render the whole glory: to him I commit all my care. I obey simply and
plainly in all things his will: and as much as in me is, I study to do for
all men, and to hurt no man. If ye learn only this of me, ye shall feel
and perceive these miserable tumultes and troubles to be assuaged, wherewith
now ye be tossed and turmoyled without any end, and ye shall get rest and
quietness to your minds: which shall follow you and be with you in the mid
tempests of adversities which trouble you on every side. A meke and a cold
mind is the fountain of all man's tranquillity and quietness. Only having
confidence how down your necks. There is no cause why ye should fear my
yoke. It seems hard and heavy unto the unbelievers, but unto them which with
all their heart trust unto the goodness of God, which have received the fire of
the evangelical charity, my yoke is soft and easy, and my burden is light.
For the certain and sure hope of rewards, makes the yoke pleasant: and the
inessable love toward God, makes the burden light. For what is not sweet and
pleasant to him that has a love to it? If the mind have a good conscience
and be void of all care, if it have a certain trust of the rewards of
everlasting life, what shall spryng or rise which can trouble or move such
a mind?

The.xii. Chapter.

ANd upon a certain day as Jesus went by the corn, and his Disciples stirred
with hunger and going before him, plucked the ears of the corn, and rubbyng
them with their hands, eat the corn: the Phariseis taking occasion on every
side falsely to blame them, said unto him: See thou not what thy disciples
do breaking the Sabbath day? Why than do thou not forbid them since they do
upon the Sabbath day, that which is not lawful? Here Jesus so defended his
disciples, that they could not blame him, as the aucthour or breakyng of the
Sabbath day, and teaches them withal, that such manner ordinances ought to
cease as often as necessity or some notable profit chances. For the Sabbath
day, fastinges, and such like constitucions were not ordained for man's hurt
and undoing, but for his preseruacion and health. Therefore he does object
against the Phariseis being skillful in the law, an exaumple out of the law,
and that of a man not of the common sort, but of him whom they counted chiefly
to be an honest man and blameless. Why (quod he) do ye falsely blame my
disciples for that they assuage their hunger with a small thing, and easy to
be gotten? Have ye not red how that holy David constrained by necessity, Have
ye not read what David did? etc.
enterprised a greater thing. Who fleyng from Saul, when he came to the city
of Nobe, did eat the loaves, which they called the leaves set forth to be
showed, and not only he, but also his folowers and servants? It is unlawful
for any man saving only priests and Levites, to eat of these loaves: but when
he was in danger for hunger, neither the priests feared to show him these
loves, nor David feared not to touched and eat them, as though they had been
profane and not holy. If ye allow the doing of the priest Albimalech: if ye
disalow not the doing of the Prophet David: why do ye reprove my disciples for
a thing much less to be regarded? For what a finale work is this to pluck
up the ears of corn being at hand, and to eat the corn rubbed out with your
hands? Or have ye not ^ed in the law? etc.
Besides this the law it self commands the Sabbath to be broken. For the
priests in the temple killing ye beasts on the Sabbath day, and exercising
the bucherly office, gathering together a pile of wood and setting it a fire,
plucking of the skin, cuttyng them in pieces, and sethyng them, break not
they the Sabbath day? the law suffers no work to be done, and yet the
sacrate priests do exercise and use these foul works in any holy place upon
the sabbath day. Ye know that these things be done, and ye do allow them
for this, But I say unto you. etc.
because they make for the use of the temple. If the authority of the temple
be so great, that the work which is bestowed upon it does not break the
Sabbath day, this I say unto you: Hear is one of greater authority than the
temple. They that do service unto him, ought more to be excused from the blame
of breakyng of the Sabbath day. If they break not the Sabbath day which
labor in the sacrifices of Moses: much more ought they to be excused that
serve and wait upon the gospel, which is a sacrifice most acceptable to
God. He that did ordain the Sabbath day may also take away the Sabbath: and
he that ordained the Sabbath day, did ordain it for man's sake, and
contrariwise he made not man because of the Sabbath day. It is mete therefore
that the keeping of the Sabbath day give place to the profit and commodity of
man, and not man to perish because of the Sabbath day. If sacrifice be made
so much of, that whosoever attends upon it, may blameless break the Sabbath
day, why hold ye not him excused, which by a necessari^ benefyte helps his
neighbor upon the Sabbath day? For God confesses that he estemeth more this
kind of sacrifice, than if a man offer up to him a beast. For he says by his
Prophet Osee. Wherefore if ye w^ste what this means. etc.
I desire mercy and not sacryfice: And the knowledge of God, more than burnt
sacrifice. Ye take upon you to be learned in the law, and yet this is written
in the law, which if ye truly understood, ye would never have blamed them
that be blameless, for a light matter, and noisome to no man. For there be
certain ordinances, not that they be good or ill of themselfes, but that by
some means they be profitable toward godliness, and do rather signify, than
bring or give holiness: as be kinds of meat, the color or fashion or
garments, or the stuff that they must be made of, fasting, and holy days.
These things we must not so supersticiously observe and keep, that for them we
omit and let pass things that be of themselves and ever good, or do those
things which be of themselves and ever ill.

Aduoutrye, homicide, back bytyng and envy, be ever ill and wicked: And yet
they that be of the pharisaicall religion, do less abhor from these
things, than from the b^^akyng of the Sabbath day. To help thy nedye
neghbour is ever godly and holy, and yet the Phariseis under the color of
keeping of the Sabbath day, suffer their neighbor to be grieved and vexed.

This dangerous supersticion, Jesus Christ studied clearly to pluck out of
the minds of his disciples. Therefore to the intent he might beat the same into
the minds of all men by a more manifest example, departing from this place, he
returned into their Synagogue, mynding to take them to witness, whom he knew
to be chiefly infected with this disease. And behold, furthwith there was given
him occasion of a miracle. For there was one in the multitude which had a lame
and a wichered right hand. And behold there was a ma^ne having a withered hand
Now the Phariseis lekyng after an honest quarrel to accuse Jesus, marked him
whether he would heal the man upon the sabbath day, which a little before
defended thapostles where as they were blamed for breakyng of the sabbath day.
But Jesus myndyng to declare unto all men that their accusemente came not of
religion but of envy, commanded the man with the lame hand to come forth
before them, that the fault might appear unto them all, to the intent they
might be moved with pity toward the miserable man, which had that membre
dead and unprofitable, And they asked him. etc.
that is most necessary for a poor manne. But before he healed the man not
ignoraunte what the Phariseis thought, he demanded of them this question. Is
it lefull to heal a man on the sabbath day? And whether is it more
tolerable among you to do good to a man or to do ill, to save a man or to
destroy him? For he destroys him, who when he may save him, does not save
him. But they all held their peace lest the people should think them cruel,
if they should say, it were not lawful to help and succor a miserable manne
on the sabbath day, or lest they should lose their occasion to blame Jesus,
if they had answered it had been lawful. They therefore saying nothing, Who
among you shall have a sheep.
Jesus himself bryngyng forth an example leused the knot of the question.
Which among you (quod he) shall be found so religious and devout a keeper of
the sabbath day, that if it chance one of his sheep to be in danger, by
falling into the dyke on the sabbath day, will he not put to his hand
furthwith to pluck her out? If avarice can do so much with you, that ye had
rather break the sabbath day, than to diminyshe your substance by one sheep:
how much more ought charity to prevail, and obtain of you, to help your
neighbor on the sabbath day, which is far better than a sheep? It is
manifest therefore (I report me to you) to be lawful to help your neighbor
with a good turn upon the sabbath day. But when Jesus perceived that their
envy would not be mitigated neither by these words, Than says he to the
manue.
nor by the sight of the miserable man, and that they would not be moved by so
evident and plain reason, casting his iyes about, taking it grievously, and
being sorry for such great blindness of their hearts, he turned unto him that
had the dry and withered hand, and said: Put forth thine hand: and at that
word he put forth his hand as plyaunt and nimble, as the other was.

The Phariseis driven into a rage by this so notable an act, when they
perceived that they had lost an occasion to accuse Jesus, departing out of the
Synagoge, and leauyng the multitude whom they perceived to bear a good mind
unto Jesus, consulted secretly with the Herodians, which also had to do with
John his disciples, which enuyed yr glory of Jesus, by what means they might
rydde Jesus out of the way. They had now a will toward murder, and nothing
lacked but a meet occasion. But Jesus not ignoraunte what they intended,
withdrewe himself from that place, less he might seem to have given some
occasion of extreme delyng to the rageyng and furyous men. He might have
spytefully represte them, he might have overwhelmed them with miracles, And the
people followed him he healed them all.
he might have destroyed the^ also, but mynding to show the evangelical
mekenes, he gave place to their rage and fury, if perhaps they would relent and
repent: and thus far he gave place unto them, that* nevertheless in other
places he distributed his heavenly doctrine unto the multitude, which followed
him thick and threfold, and as many sick men, or otherwise miserable, as were
brought unto him, he healed them. For his time was not yet come: the gospel
was not yet sufficiently spread abroad. Wherefore he gave place to them, And
charged the^. etc.
not to provide for himself, but to take from them the occasion of a wicked
deed, and to teach withal, that the wisdom of the gospel ought not to be
defended against the disobedient with threatenings, with checkes or
contencions, but with mildenes and mekenes. Therefore he commanded the
multitude yt followed him, that they should not disclose him, lest the rumor
spreadyng abroad, That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by ^say. etc.
the Phariseis might be stirred more and more. Neither was this thing done by
chance, but it was prophesied now long before by the Prophet Esaias that it
should so come to pass: In ye wrytinges of the which Prophet the father
does descrybe and set forth the victory of his son obtained through
mekenes, and the salvation of the gospel, translated to the Gentyles, for the
pertinacye and stubbernesse of the Jews, sufficiently known to all men.
Behold (says he) my son whom I have chosen before other: behold my dear
beloved, in whom my soul is delited. I will give unto him my meke and gentle
spirit, by thinspiracion whereof, he shall show judgment, not only to the
people of Israel, but also to all nations. He shall not do this tumultuously
or violently. For he shall not chyde nor shall not cry out against them that
be con^enciouse. No man shall hear his voice in the streets, as they be wont
that war with the tongue. He shall give place to the invincible malice, but he
shall endeavor to bring all unto salvation. He shall give none occasion to the
ill of their incurable destruction, but he shall sane all, if by any means
they can turn themselves unto the better. He will not despise the weak, he
will not despise the feeble, in whom there shall remain any good hope: he will
cheryshe them, rather than oppress them. He will not break the browsed reed,
and he will not quench out the smokyng flax, until the truth of it self,
by the process of time, have the higher hand and until the madness of the
wicked through their own default break out so far, that all men may
perceive, that they be worthily repelled and cast away. Than the Gentyles
shall enbrace his doctrine, which the Jews despised, and put their trust in
him, whom the Jews refused to trust.

shall not stand. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against
himself. (...) than shall his kingdom endure? And if I cast out devils by the
help of Beelzebub, ^y whose help do your children cast them out? Therefore they
shall be your judges. But if I cast out devils by the spirit of God, shall is
the kingdom of God come unto you. Or else how can one enter into a strong man's
house and spoil his jewels except^ he first bind the strong man, and than
spoil his house? It chanced in the mean time that among many whom he
healed, they offered unto Jesus one that was possessed with a devil, which
had taken from the wretched man both his iyes and his tongue. Jesus commanded
the devil to depart: he departed, and forthwith the most miserable manne was
wholly restored in such wise that both he saw and spoke. The multitude was
amassed at that so great a master, and now suspectyng him to be Messiah, they
^pake among themselves. Is this that son of David, whom the Prophets did
promise? This fellow drives out devils, etc.
When the Phariseis heard this voice of the people, they set not upon Jesus
himself, of whom always they had the wurse, but they endeavor to withdr^^^
the hearts of the multitude from the honoryng and veneracion of him ^^ cannot
be (quod they) that this is that son of David as ye suppose. For he shall
come borne up and mayntayned by the power of God. But when Jesus knew their
thoughts etc.
He casts not out devils by the help of God, since he is wicked and a breake^
of the Sabbath day, a glotton, and a drunkard, and a companion of the
Publican^s, but by the help of Beelzebub the prince of devils. Now Jesus
although he heard not their voice, yet knowing both what they thought, and what
they spoke to others, turnyng unto the Phariseis, so ordered his answer, that
by manifest reason he reproneth their mad raising and rebuke, and yet he
rayseth not on them again, but rather provoke them lovingly to embrace their
health and salvation. Every kingdom (quod he) divided with inward division
and discord, must needs come to naught. And every house stryuyng with it
self, with inward disagreing must needs fall. And if Satan drives out
Satan, And if I cast out devils. etc.
and if one devil dryueth out an other, how shall his kingdom endure? And
how is it lykely and greable, all deuilles being enemies of men, desiryng
nothing but the hurt and destruction of them, whose health miserably they do
envy, that now they favor so greatly their health, that for this cause one
devil stryue^ (...) fights with an other? Now if I cast out devils by the
power and help of Beelzebub, these me disciples your children, Therefore they
shall be your judges.
whom ye know, by whose help cast they out devils? for they also cast out
devils, and yet ye reprove not them, but only me ye falsely blame: and yet they
have might of me to cast them out. Therefore it cannot be that they should chase
away devils in the power of God, and I in the might of Beelzebub, since they do
it in my name. And therefore men unlettered and unlearned be able to do so
great things, because they believe simply that by the power of God I chase
away devils. Therefore their godly belefe shall condemn your unbelief, because
you desire rather unjustly to reprove, whereas ye might be godly folowers. And
if the thing it self declare that I do cast out devils not by the help of ye
devil, but by the might of God, ye ought not to doubt any more, but that the
son of David is come, and the kingdom of God, since ye see that the strength
of the adversaries deeth vanyshe away, when they which profess the gospel
call upon my name. Therefore like as there is a concord and agreement among the
devils themselves to destroy all men: so I which am cum to save all men, have
no concord nor agreement with them, but deadl^ dissencion and disagremente.
Hitherto Beelzebub has exercised his tyranny upon sinful men given unto
fylthie desires: I taking a way the sins of men do confound and destroy
Beelzebub the Prince with his whole guard, and I do restore unto god through
innocencye, whom he did possess through unrighteous. The thing is done by
force, not by any agremente between me and the devils. They feel, and confess
that there is a present power whereunto they be forced to give place. Or else
how may it be that any man might enter into the tower of a mighty man, and
take away his stuff, unless first he ouercum the mighty man, and lay him in
bands? Than he once kept under which was hable to resyste, he will spoil the
whole house, and as it were carye away his pray. The world is the house of
Beelzebub. In this he claimed to him acerteyne kingdom, because the whole
world was given to ambicion, excess, fylthy lusts, auaryce, anger, envy, and
other noysom desires, by the which he is made mighty. I as a man of more power
and valiantnes, have entered into his kingdom, and ouercu^ming him have wunne
again to the true prince, that which he unjustly did possess. Therefore there
is no agreement between us: the princes be diverse, the kingdoms be diverse, by
no band or leage to be reconciled and made at one.

He that will be grafte in the kingdom of god, must withdraw himself from
the kingdom of Beelzebub, and must fight against him in my tents. No man can
be at peace with god, unless he be at war with the devil. I take gods
part, and not Beelzebubs. Therefore whosoever is not in my tents, is my enemy,
and aduersarye. And whosoever healpeth not me in gatheryng together, is against me
in scateryng abroad. See that ye join your self to the better part. It is
better to obtain health in the kingdom of God, than everlasting death in the
kingdom of the devil. Cease from seruyng of sin, and the devil shall have
no power over you. God will receive them to his kingdom that run from him, and
will not impute the sins of the former life, be they never so outragiouse,
unto such as be penitent. This only is to be observed, that no man blinded
with envy, and peruetted with malice, withstand the glory of god against
his own conscience: and where as he sees with his lies the divine power by
manifest signs and wonders, to be opened to the world, that he attribute it
not to the spirit of Beelzebub. Wherefore this I assure you, whatsoever is done
by word or deed, shall be remitted unto men, so that they repent them. God
does easyly forgive that which by any means is venial and pardonable by
the reason of frayltye of man's nature. But if any man speak blasphemye
against the spirit of God, whose manifest power he sees of his plain
weorkes, he shall scarcely find pardonne and forgeuenes. And whosoever speaks
blasphemy against the son of man, whom he despyseth for the weakness of his
flesh, he shall be pardoned, because error and ignorance mixte with his
dooyng, does exclude perverse and set malice. But whosoever speaks blasphemy
against the holy ghost, shall uneath obtain pardonne and forgeuenes either in
this world, or in the world to come. This thing spoke Jesus to thyntente he
would fear the Phariseis from their obstinate frowardnes, because when they
saw and perceived that those things which he did, could not be doene but
by the spirit and the might of God, yet they moved with envy resisted the
glory of god, and ascrybed his miracles unto Beelzebub, whose spirit they
said wroughte in Christ. When after common reason (says he) the free is
known of the fruit, Either make the ^re good and his fruit good etc.
why do ye blame the tree, sithe ye cannot but allow and commend the fruit*
The miracles which I work, ease and releue the miseries of men: they hurt
no man, they be not done for vain ostentacion and glory, or for gain and
lucre, but to do good and to healpe. No man can deny but this is good, freely
to do for them that be in affliccion. Why therefore say ye that that which is
good of it self, cummeth from Beelzebub, who by your own judgment is al
naught? If ye will hyde the blindness of your minds, ye must speak things
that may stand together, now the things which ye speak, agree not together
after the common judgment of men. Therefore either make the tree good and
his fruit good, or else make the tree ill and his fruit ill. Either grant
that I am moved with a good spirit, whereas ye grant that my works be good,
or else say that my works be ill, that your* saying may appear probable, where
ye say that I have the spirit of wicked Beelzebub. And if my doings be such
that ye must needs confess that they be good, ascrybe not good things to an
ill author. Ye kindred of vipers, ill men springyng of ill pa^entes, conjecture
and judge ye by your selves: Do ye not speak even as ye be? and do not your
weorkes declare what spirit ye have? Ye envy the glory of god, and falsely
blame his spirit. From whence cummeth so pestilente fruit, but of an evil
tree? For as it can not be that a wild tree should bring forth genti^
fruit, and that a tree of poisoned juice should bring forth holsom appulles:
even so how can ye speak well sith ye be ill? For as the fruit takes his
taste and verdoure of the juice of the root: so communycacion ryseth of that
which is hyd in the heart, like as a good manne brings furthe good things
out of the good tresure of his heart: so the ill man brings furthe ill
things out of the evil tresure of his heart. Whose heart is replenished with
godliness and charity, they speak words which savor of that that is in the
heart. Whose heart is replenished with envy, pride, and avarice, they use such
communycacion, which by the mouth does utter the affeccion of the heart.
Men shall be esteined before god not only of their deeds, but also of their
words. An ill thought is pestiferouse and noisome only unto the thynker, but
ill talking does power out the poison of the heart amongst many. The tongue
therefore must be rescayned, not only from outragiouse blasphemies, from
^aolding, rhiding, and backbityng, and uncleanly communicacion, but utterly
from all things whereof cummeth none honest profit or commodity. Yea I say
unto you, that man shall render a count in the day of judgment not only for
filthy talkyng, but also for every vain, idle, and unprofitable word, that
they shall speak. For their words also, shall be taken and accounted for deeds.
Of thy words either thou shalt be judged good, if good words issue out of a
good heart, or thou shalt be condemned as unjust, if ill words issue out of
an ill heart. And here understand ye the perfect justice of the kingdom of
heaven, far passing the justice of Moses law. For that law punysheth only
the manifest blasphemye against god: here shall be punyshed also any reuylyng
or taunte against thy neyghhour, and not only the noisome and perilouse
saying, but also the idle and vain word. For that which is unprofitable on
the tree, is the burden of the tree and not the fruit: and therefore it is
noisome, because it occupies the time and the ears of the hearer, without any
fruit or profit, whereas the tongue is given for this intent, that therewith
we should profit our selves and our neighbor, and that with this member we
should celebrate and magnifye the glory of God.

Certain of the scrybes and phariseys when they had heard these things,
dissemblyng the rage of their minds, go unto Jesus with more gentyl words,
as though they would now believe him, if for their sake he would show sum
miracle worthy and meet for them and also for him, who challenged to him the
spirit of god, and had always in his mouth the heavenly father. Master
(quod they) we which be not of the common sort, but learned men, desire of
you to see sum notable sign from heaven, which may declare that ye be derely
beloved of god, and that ye do that thing which ye do by his power and might.
But Jesus knowing their subtle thought and obstinate malice, which required
a sign for none other intent, but to take a new occasion thereby falsely to
accuse him, chiefly sith it is more easy to pycke a quarrel at those things
which be showed from heaven, than at those things which appear before the
iyes, The evil and aduoustetous etc.
be heard with cares, and touched with hands: not bearyng so great
frowardnes, but in manner turning from them, and taking it angrely (as it were)
with himself, made answer, saying: O naughtye and counterfeit nation, which
doethe glory that they have god to their father, which does crake of her
progenitoure Abraham, where as it follows rather them which forsakynge God,
wurshypped the golden calfe: which styrred sedicion against Moses: which
murmured in the deserte: which killed the Prophets: whereas it declares that
it has Beelzebub to her father, with whose spirit being replenyshed, it
does rebel against the spirit of God.

But it shall have no sing given from heaven, which it may calumniate and
reprove, and which it is unworthy to have, for as much as it is wholly set
and given to the yearthe, but once there shall be a sign given to it out of the
earth, whereby it may be ouercum and utterly peryshe, if it will not
convert. This nation meruayled at the miracle of the Prophet Jonas, which
swallowed up of a beast in the sea, was restored again alive after three
days. This shall be a sufficient sign for them, if they may see him reuyue
again by the divine power, For as Jonas was three days* etc.
whom by their malice they have slain. This miracle shortly shall be showed
unto them, which they will falsely slander. For like as Jonas wyllyngly
delivered himself to death, and was received of the beast of the sea, and was
in her belly three days, and three nyghtes, and being paste hope of all men,
by and by through the healpe of God was restored alive: so the son of man
shall be dead in the heart of the yearthe three days and three nyghtes. By
this figure and dark exaumple, Jesus syginfieth his death and burial, and
furthwith his rysyng from death. And he added. As Jonas was to the Ninevites,
so am I to you. He told them that the vengeance of god, The men of Niniue
shall arise, etc.
and the destruction of their city was at hand, unless they would repent: I
declare the same unto you all. But the Ninevites whom ye despise as heathen
and idolaters in comparison of you, shall rise in the judgment of God, and
shall declare you worthelye to be damned in comparison of them. For they
although they were sinful, yet being a fearde at the threatenynges of the
Prophet, humbled themselves unto penance. And behold: here is one greatter
than Jonas, which preaches to you in vain.

The Ninevites were people far from the wurshyppynge of God, Jonas unknown,
and simple, and meke came unto them. No man commended him, or told before of
his cummyng, he showed no miracles, he allured unto him no body with benefit,
he promised no great thing. Only he threatened undoing and destruction, and he
preached no longer than three days. I being promised by thoracles of the
Prophets, so often commended by the testimonye of John, by the testimony of
the father, being your countreman, being cumme also of the same parents of
whom ye glory and crake: have taught you now so long time, testifyng by so
many miracles, that my doctrine is not vain: have help so many with my free
benefits, and do not thunder sore threatenynges, but of mine own accord
promise forgeuenes of all sins: I offer everlasting felicity of the heavenly
kingdom: yet it is said that I have the spirit of Beelzebub: The queen of
the south shall rise* etc,
I am laid at with deadlye deceytes, so far ye be from bendyng and bowyng
to true penance. Furthermore, the queen of Saba shall rise in the judgment,
to the reproach and condemnacion of this generation, because that she by the
reason of tidings brought far of, leuing her kingdom and her countreye, took
a long iourneye unto Solomon, not moved by any fear, but only for the desire
of wisdom. And she did not only cum to Solomon, but also she brought with her
great gifts. And behold, there is one in this place greater than Solomon. For
what like thing did Solomon to the things which ye see me do? or what like
thing taught Solomon? And yet ye put me to al kind of rebukes, which of mine
own accord bring unto you the doctrine of the gospel, whereby ye may be
saved: furthermore also, ye go about to do me more grieuouse displeasures which
am beneficial unto you. But the greatter the wonders and benifites be whereby
ye be provoked unto penance: the greuouser shall your punyshemente be,
unless ye repent in time.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places
seking t^st, and finds none. Than he says: I will return into my house,
from whence I came, And when he is cum, he fyndeth it empty, and swept and
garnyshed. Than ^e goes and takes unto him seven other spirits worse than
himself, and so enters in, and dwells there* and the end of that man is
worse than the beginning. So shall it be also unto this froward generation:
Further what thing should chance unto them, and into what blyndnesse the
people of Israel should cum, and how miserably it should be handled of the
princes of Rome, and how it should be banished throughout the world, rejected
and despised of all nations, Jesus had rather to signify by a certain darcke
exaumple, than to declare it manifestlye. And he takes a similitude of a man
which was possessed of a devil, who whereas he was once delivered and
restored to his right mind, afterward by his own defaulte receyuyng the
devil again, was more grievously vexed, than he was before. When an unclean
spirit (quod he) goes out from a man, being banyshed from his old hospital,
he walks in dry and baren places, seking rest and fyndeth none. Than says
he with himself. I will return into the hou^e from whence I went, where when
he cummeth, he fyndethe it decked and cleansed, but without any geast. Than he
s^yng that there is a place and not occupied of any other, not being content
to return thither himself alone, he takes unto him seven other spirits
worse than himself, which entryng into the house together, make their dwelling
there. And it cummeth to pass, that the man is more grievously vexed than he
was before. So shall it happen to this ungracious nation. By this similitude
Jesus noted the obstinate and wylfull malice of the pople of Israel, falling
back oftentimes to their old manners. In times paste they served and followed
the deuilish vices and desires. It was sumwhat delivered by the law and the
Prophets, but returned often again to her own manner and disposicion. It
returned to Idolles, it did sacrifice in the woods, it killed the Prophets.
It was redressed and amended through affliccions by Pharao in Egypt, by
Nabuchodonoser in Babylon, and by diverse other calamities and miseries.
Finally provoked of the son of god so many ways, has not only renewed,
but also far exceded all the wickedness of her forefathers, not only araiyng
the harmless and the well doer with al kind of spitefulnes, but also driuyng
him unto the cross and passion with false accusementes. Whereof a certain
monstrous blyndenes, and seven times more miserable than the blindness of their
fathers, has possessed their hearts, and therefore they shall be more cruelly
handled and destroyed than they have been hitherto.

As Jesus spoke these things to the people, there came the mother of Jesus,
with certain of his cosens which desired to speak with him. But when they
could not cumme unto him for the multitude being so thycke, and standing
about the doors of the house, a voice passing over from one to another, a
certain man interrupted the communicacion of Jesus, and told him that his
mother and his brethren were at the door which desired to speak with him.
But Jesus offended with this importunity and troublesumnes, and wyllyng also
to teach that such affeccions should be passed little upon, as often as the
matter of the gospel is in hand, and that the kindred of the minds ought more
to be regarded than the kynred of the bodies, which is gotten by virtue and
not by the nerenes of blood, the which also is more large than the other, he
answers him which interrupted him. Who is my mother and who are my brethren?
I being occupied about the heavenly business knowledge no mother nor brethren,
joined by carnal affinity: whereof sum be far of perchance in hearts. And
holdyng out his hand toward his disciples, which syttyng nere received
gredely in silence his wholesome doctrine, if ye will know (quod he) my very true
kinsfolks which be most dear unto me, these be my mother my sisters, and my
brethren. Here is no difference of kind or age, no respect of kindred.
Whosoever does obey the will of my father which is in heaven, he is my mother,
he is my sister, he is my brother. I esteem hyghely the spiritual and not the
bodily affinity. This affinity every man may come by. Every man like as he is
most obedient unto my fathers will, so he is most nere and most dear unto me.

The.xiii. Chapter.

AT the same time when Jesus saw that the place was not able to receive such
a multitude, he went out of the house to the water side. And when he came
thither, he satte upon (...) bank, teaching the people which gaped after his
doctrine insaciablye. Further when he saw the multitude so great and thick,
that they thruste him, and pressed him: and to thintente he might be at more
liberty from the people, he entered into a ship, and spoke out of that as out
of a pulpit, to the people standing upon the bank. For so he might be both
better seen and better heard of many, And he spoke to the^ many things in
similitudes,
because the sand of the bancke and the brincke of the bancke, made as though
it were a round auditory.

And because in that multitude every man had not one mind, he showed and set
furthe many things unto them by dark similitudes, either because this manner
of speaking is familiar and commonly used of the prophets, or because it is
most meet and convenient for to teach and to move the minds of the people,
because that comparison taken of things that be well known and perceived
also of them that be unlearned, by and by touches and moves every one: or
because by this fear and pleasant manner of speaking, things that be
spoken both crepeth into men's minds more pleasauntlye, and sticks more
surely: or else because that this manner of monicion slau^deryng no man, but
secretly by similitude touching every man's conscience, is wont commonly less
to offend. And first of all he lets furthe a parable, signifiyng that many
on every side come runnyng to the preaching of the gospel, and yet fruit
springs not in them all: which chances not by the fault of the teacher,
but by the fault of the hearers. Nor like fruit springs not in all the
hearers, but according as every manne brings a mind void from worldly
cares and desires: so is the fruit of the word that is heard of him
greatest. Therefore exhortyng to give audience, he puts forth this parable,
saying: The sowyet went forth to sow his sede, and as he casted his sede (...)
certain corns fell by the way side, and because they were ba^e and
uncovered, the birds came fliyng and eat them up. Again other sum fe^^ to
the rough and stony places, which when they were not depely covered with
yea^th^, because of stones that ^etted them, nor could not take root depely
enough, they sprang up shortelye and before their time* through the warmnes
of the sun, because there was not much yearthe to keep them covered unto
their time, nor no deep root to minister hun^oure and moisture. Again other
sum fell into the thorny ground, and by the reason of increase of thorns,
they were kept down and choked, and could not ryfe nor spryng up at their
liberty. Further other sum fell upon a good and fruitful ground, and springyng
up luckely brought forth fruit, yet not al alyke but according to the
goodness of the ground: sum an hundred fold, sum three score fold, some
thyrtye fold as much: so that of one sede sprang an ear that bare an hundred
corns: of another that bare three score, of another that bare thyrty. Jesus
speaking these things did not as than explicate and declare the dark riddel
and similitude, but leaves it to every manne to conjecture and think upon in
his mind. Only he made an exhortacion that they that had meet ears should
hear the parable diligently.

But another time when the disciples had Jesus alone, they went unto him and
asked him why he spoke unto the people by dark and obscure similitudes. Unto
whom Jesus answered on this wise: because as yet they yield not themselves
mete to have the truethe opened unto them, by the wyiche certain of them
emonge the multitude be not only not the better, but also be pricked and
stirred to be the worse. Wherefore I utter unto them like manner of preaching as
they bring hearts to hear. They will not understand things that be most
manifest, I do inuolue and wrappe my language with darkness, that by such
means I may provoke them to the desire of learning and searchyng. But ye
which receive symplye and delicouslye the thing that is given, ye are worthy
to be partakers of the more secret things concerning the wisdom of the
gospel. For unto him that has, it shall be given, that he may have
aboundantlye, but unto him that has nothing, nothing shall be added,
insomuche that he shall be also spoiled of that which he seemed for to have.
In other things it is a cruel thing to spoil him that is nedy: Here because
poverty cummeth through the defaulte of the nedy, it is mete and rygh^ to take
from the unkind manne. We bring and offer freely certain principles of
heavenly Philosophy, and that according to the capacity and simplicity of the
minds, as castyng certain seeds, which whosoever receives desirously, truly he
provoke us to commit mo things unto him. Contrariwise, whosoever despises and
rejects that which is given freely, and turns it to occasion of more ill,
is he not worthy to be spoiled of that which he had unworthily?

For this cause I speak to them in dark parables because they will hear the
manifest truth either with no profit, or else to their own hurt. For it
cu^methe to pass through their frowardnes, that where as they have iyes and se
manifest tokens, yet being blinded with envy, they see not that which they
see. And where as they have ears and hear the truth that cannot be confuted,
yet they hear not that they hear, nor understand not ye which they hear
although they understand. Truly the saying of Esaie is fulfilled in these
men: Ye shall hear with your ears and not understand, and ye shall see with
your iyes, and yet not se. For the heart of this people is hardened, and they
be dull of hearing, and they have closed their iyes, lest they might se with
their iyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and
at last turn unto me, and I make them whole. Truly these men therefore be
unfortunate, but not to be pitied though they be very miserable, which
witingly and willinglye secke their own destruction, and reject their own
health.

Contrariwise your iyes are blessed, because they see the things that we do:
your ears are blessed, because they hear the things yt we speak: Your
hearts are blessed, because they understand the will of my father. This is no
mean nor common felicity, truly many prophets, and many just and holy men,
have desired to see ye things which ye se, and happened not to see them: and
to hear the things which ye hear, and they had not the gift to hear them.
And they truly as in a dream, gessed at the thing that should cum, which ye se
before you, and also hear.

Therefore because your simplicity and desire of knowledge, deserves this,
harke^ ye what the parable does mean, which I put forth of the sowier sowing
his sede. There be three sorts of men, in whom sede of the word of the gospel
either brings forth no fruit, or else brings not to perfeccion, the fruit
that is sprung up. And the first most baren of all. These be they which
lightely and negligently hear the words of the heavenly doctrine, and ^uffer
them not to enter into their minds, nor fasten them in their remembrance, to
thintente they may be rooted there: but their minds being compassed and
fensed with no desire nor care, being armed with no purposes against the
assaults of vain thoughts, at every light occasion they suffer that that is
sown, to be spurned at and trodden down. That perceiving the ill and naughtye
one, which lies in wait and enuieth good begynnynges, by and by sends into
the mind, certain fleyng and waueryng cares, which may destroy the seed
before that it spryng up in grass, or have any root, that they be no better
than if they had not heard at all. These be signified by the seed that fell by
the hye way where go both men and beasts, that is to say, all manner of
cares, affeccions of kynred and of affinity, care for common offices, love,
hatred, suspicion, and such other. These things chase away the word of the
gospel out of the mind, But he that received the seed* etc.
wel^e^e before it be received. Again there is an other, which receives (as
it were seed) the word of the gospel with his ears, and gredelye puts it
into his heart, recordyng and devising with himself to frame his life after
the rewle thereof: but because he prynteth it not utterly in the inwardes of
his mind, but after the fashion of men, he does that he does lightly with a
certain affeccion for a time, he nourysheth the seed that he has taken,
until it be grown up to a grass, and shows a certain hope of evangelical
godliness, absteynyng from great sins, and florishyng with mean virtues. But
if any storm of persecucion begin to rise, and if for the gospel sake
banishment be offered, or prison, punishment, death, and such other which
require a steadfast strength of the mind, than, as at the vehemente heat of
the sun, they wyther a way, and utterly fainte and decay. A figure of this
was the stony ground, which received the sede, and brought it forth into
grass, He also that received, etc.
but it was not able to succor and defend it with humor against the heat of
the sun, for through the stones it can have no deep nor sure root. Again
there is an other which gredely hears the word of the gospel, and sets
it deep enough in his mind, and keeps it long, but his mind being entangled
and choked with trouble^^ in cares of this world, and especial of riches. as
it were with certain thick thorns, he can not freely follow that he loves.
Because he will not suffer these thorns, which cleave together and be
inta^gled one with another among themselves, to be cut away, the fruit of the
seed that is sown does utterly perish. This was signified by the similitude
of the sede which was received in the ground full of thorns and briers.
Further the seed that was received in the good ground, signifies them which
both hear the word of the gospel and record it with themselves, and
fasten it surely in their remembrance, and so do power it into thaffeccions
of their mind, that they will not swerve from it to dye therefore, who also do
rydde and deliver themselves from affeccions and filthye cares of riches,
which suffer not the mind to be free and at liberty, but give themselves
wholly to the heavenly inspiracion. Which also beare^^; etc.
The seed of the doctrine of the gospel is not unprofitable to such minds.
But like as one kind of wheat brings not furthe like fruit in all grounds,
but it springs with less or more increase according to the goodness of the
ground: So after the godly desire and capacity of them that hear the word,
the fruit of godliness cummeth forth more aboundauntlye. By this parable Jesus
taught us, with what study and desire the heavenly doctrine ought to be
received, if we desire that fruit should spring of it. These things Jesus did
interpret and declare unto his disciples aparte.

But let us return unto the order of our former communicacion. The lord
Jesus proposed unto them another parable, to show them also that there was
another poison and mischief to be taken head of, if a man will lay up pure and
fine corn in his barn. For the other ylles do only hurt ye sede latelye
sown, or spryngyng into grass. This does corrupt the corn now sprung up
and well grown. This poison is, when Satan, which could not choke and
destroy the seed of the evangelical doctrine with flying, waueryng, and idle
thoughts, nor with troublesome persecucions, nor with carefulnes of riches,
honors and like things, wherewith man's life is entangled, goes about to
infecte it by false Apostles and wicked Byshopes and Heritikes, which wresteth
and wriethe by subtyl interpretacion, the heavenly doctrine after their lusts
and desires, and myngle true things with false, and sincere and pure things
with vicious and fawty. The parable is after this sort. The kingdom of heaven
(quod he) is like unto an housbandman, which being a good husband, sowed good
seed in his field. But his servants being aslepe, there came privily a
certain aduersarye, which bare the husband manne no good will, and because he
could not in the night take away the seed which was now laid safely in the
ground: he uses craft and deceyte to hurt it. He scatereth and mengeleth with
the wheat that was sown, the unprofitable seed of cockelles, and this done
he went away. First no man perceived this deceit. But when the seed was
now sprung up into grass, and the stalks were laden and burdened with ears,
than at length the cockels growyng up together, (their vnlykenes vtteryng or
showing them,) began to appear. Than the servants merueylyng how this
should cum to pass, go unto the husband man. Master (quod they) dyddeste
not thou sow good seed in the field, how is it than that cokelles be
mengled with them? But the master suspectyng who was author of the shreude
turn, says: Mine adversary did this which bears me so evil will, that
he has a plasure to hurt me, though he have no profit himself thereby.
Than spoke the servants: will ye than that we go and gather the cockelles and
cleanse the corn? The master says: In no case, lest peradventure as ye
pluck up the cockelles unadvisedly, ye pluck up also therewith the wheat that
grows nere by. Suffer the wheat to grow together with the cockelles unto
harvest time. Than will I commit this matter to the harvest folks, that
before they mow and cut down, they shall first gather the cockelles and
bind them together a part in bundels for to feed the fire, and afterward
lay up and couche the clean wheat in my barn.

Another parable put he forth unto them saying: The kingdom of heaven is like
to a grain of mustarde seade, which a man took and sowed in his field,
which is the least of al seades. But when it is grown, it is the greatest
emong^ herbs, and is a tree, so yt the birds of the air cum and make their
nestes in the branches thereof. Again Jesus mindyng to show by a similitude
how that the philosophy of the gospel first in apperaunce abiecte and homely
through the ignominy, and slander of the cross, being as it were planted by a
few unlearned men should by little and little through the strength of the
truth, grow to such might and power, that it should go over all the world,
and should embrac^ al kind of men, proposed this redell and similitude. The
kingdom of heaven (quod he) is like unto a musterde seed, which a certain
man took and sowed in his field, which of it self is least among al pulse.
But when it is grown up, it is greater than al kinds of herbs and risethe up
as big as a tree, insomuche that the birds make their nestes in the bows
thereof.

Again Jesus did inculcate and beat in the self fame thing, doing them to
understand by what means the strength and might of the doctrine of the
gospel secretly crepyng in, and dispersed and set abroad by a few apostles,
should al^te and transform all the world into her nature: and when it shall
seem most to be consumed and extinct, than chiefly it shall set forth and show
strength. The kingdom of heaven (quod he) is like unto leaven, which being but
a little quantity, the woman put in three measures of meal, and three left it
until the little piece of leaven had changed by little and little the whole
quantity of the meal, and turned it into her own nature. All these things
Jesus declared unto the people in riddelles, and clouds of parables, and spoke
nothing unto them than without a parable: to thyntent that he might both excite
and stir their minds with dark speaking, and make them desirouse to learn,
and yet give them no hold, though they sought occasion busilye, unjustly to
reprove him. And the soothe saying of the Prophet told of this before in time
paste. I will open my mouth in parables, I will show forth things which has
been hyd hitherto since the world was made.

Than Jesus departing from the multitude went home, and they followed not, for
that they understood not what he mente, and that none occasion was given of
false reprofe. Further when he was at home alone, his familiar disciples came
unto him requiryng him to expound them the parable of the cockels mengled with
wheat. For the parable of the seed diversely sown once declared, they gessed
well of themselves what he mente by the musterd seed, and the leven put in the
meal. Jesus without any grief declared it plainly. The good husband (quod
he) which sowed the good seed, is the heavenly father: the field in which he
sowed, is the whole world and not only Iewry. Further, the good wheat that
sprang up of the good seed be they, which by the doctrine of the gospel
behave themself worthily for the kingdom of heaven, agreing to their
profession in life and deeds. The naughty cockels springyng of the ill seed
mengled with these, be ill men which profess not purely nor sincerely the
doctrine of the gospel, And the aduersarye which mengled his seed privily in
the night, whereof spryngeth peructse and ill doctrine, is the devil. The
servants which would gather the cockel before the time, be they which
think that the false apostelles and chief heretics should be rydde out of
the way with sweorde and death, where as the good man of the house wills
not that they should be killed, but suffered, if hap be that they repent,
and be turned from cockelles into wheat. And that if they repent not, they
should be kept and preserved to their judge, of whom once they shall be
punished. The time of harueste is the end of the world. The harueste folks
be the angels. In the mean season therefore the ill mengled with the good, must
be suffered, when they be suffered with less danger and peril, than they be
taken away. Further when the last time shall cum, when the good shall be severed
from the ill, when rewards shall be given to every manne for his deeds: than
the son of man the judge over all, shall send furthe his angels to cleanse
his kingdom, and they shall suffer none offense to remain there, for than
neither the good can profit the ill, nor the ill shall be suffered any more to
trouble the good: but whosoever living among the good had rather moleste and
trouble them, than to be made better by their cumpany, he shall gather them
together and shed them from the others, and deliver them to the fire of hell.
There shall they punyshed world without end: for their short and false
lusts and pleasures removed from the floor of the church, and cast into a
dark den of hell, that is to say, into the kingdom of their father, where as
now over late and unprofitable penance, shall force those miserable people to
weep and to wail and to gnashe with their teeth. Further they that cum and
spryng furthe of the good seed and persevere and continue unto the end, although
in the mean time they appear here vile and abiecte, and be afflicted of the
ill sort: than all vylenes of mortality set aparte, they shall shine like the
bright sun in their fathers kingdom. These things because they be great and
weighty things, of both parts ought not to be heard nigligently. They
perteine either to the everlasting felicity, or to the everlasting destruction
of al men. Wherefore whosoever has an ear, neither deaf nor stopped with the
desires of the world, let him hear, yt he may avoid everlasting
punisheme^tes, and obtain the life everlasting.

Beside these, to thyntent he might the more kyndle and stir the minds of
them that were his, to the desire of theuangelicall godliness, he added two
other similitudes, whereby he teaches that the professyon of the gospel is a
thing not to be desired lightly, or after the common manner, but that this
only thing ought to be labored for with great study, all other things set
aparte and that this excellent good thing must he purchased and obtained by the
loss of all your goods. Which thing though it chance not easilye to every
man, yet when it is once found it has high felicity. And although in the
mean season be hyd among men, and sets not forth it self, yet he that has
it, reioiseth secretly with himself, lokyng safely for that day, in the
which the felicity that is now obscure and darcke shall after be made
manifest and open. The kingdom of heaven (quod he) is like to a treasure hyd
in the field, which if a man perchance do get, he blabbeth it not abroad to
others, lest any take if from him, but ioying secretly and reioysyng to
himself, he goes to the lord of the ground, and sellyng all that he has and
making as much monye, as he can, byeth the fyelde, in the which he knows the
great or precious treasure is hyd, and thinks himself happy, to loose all
his mean possessions, for to be enryched with one notable ground, although he
know it not.

Again the kingdom of heaven (quod ye) is like unto a marchaunte manne,
which deliteth in goodly Margarites. And when he had got a notable good one,
byanby he sold all that he had, and bought it. And he thought not him self
the poorer, because he had now left him nothing of his old riches. Nay than
at the length he thought himself rich, because he was privy to himself, that
he had in secret possession, a precious Margaritie, which though it were but
little, yet it passed the price and value of all the other possessions.

Unto these he added also an other parable, not unlike un to the parable of the
wheat and cockels, exortyng his disciples, whom of fyshers he made apostles,
that is to say, fyshers of men, that they should study and endeavor to allure
and draw many to the professyon of the gospel, and that they should not
byanby cast away and destroy the ill mengled with the good, but save them
and keep them to be punished of their judge, if after that al things were
proved, they would not repent* Again the kingdom of heaven (quod he) is
like a net cast into the sea, which being spread abroad, does take and
embrace all kind of fyshe. Which when they now perceive to be full, than
they draw it to the bank, and now syttyng upon the dry land choose the
good fysshes and put them in their vessels, the ill and unprofitable fishes
they cast away. So shall it be in the end of the world. The angels shall go
furthe and look about what the net of the gospel does take and draw. They
shall not suffer the good to be mengled with the ill any more in one net, but
they shall esteem every man by his merits, not by his professyon. They shall
separate the ill from the cumpany of the good and shall lay up the one safely
for their master, the other they shall cast into a burning furnace: there
shall be intolerable tormente which shall be testified up weeping and gnashyng of
teeth:

Jesus to thyntente he might the more surely fasten these sayings in the
minds of his disciples: he asked of them whether they understood these things
well. When they made answer that they understood them, he added yet an other
parable, whereby he monished them that these and many such ought to be
learned, and surely remembered, to the intent that by and by upon every
occasion, they might redily take them forth: whether the hearer should be
allured with rewards, or else put in fear, by the fear of punishemente. For
the breast of the evangelical preacher ought to be (as it were) a certain
store house and a rich, and a plentiful treasure, from whence they may easily
take out diverse things, sumtyme out of the books of the old testament,
sumtime out of the evangelical Philosophy, as shall be most expedient for
their hearers. For one thing must not be spoken at all times, nor after one
fashyon, nor all men be not moved with all things. Therefore they have need of
a certain rich treasure furnished with all kind of learning. The parable is
thus. The Scribes of the Jews (quod he) when they be consul^ed, make answer
out of their books. But whosoever will be a cunnyng Scribe in the kingdom of
heaven, Therefore every scribe. etc*
it is not sufficient for him to bring forth old things, unless he bring forth
new also, like a certain rich householder which has all things in his
treasure: whether a man desire ^ewe things, or whether he would have old
things, to satisfy and content all men.

When that Jesus had taught sufficiently with these diverse parables, both the
people and his disciples, he went into his country, that is, to Nazareth:
that by often chaungeing of the place, the doctrine of the gospel might be the
farther spread abroad. In the which country of his, he began not his
preaching, lest he should seem any thing to follow man's affeccion, and yet
he would not pass it over, to teach that we ought to do good unto all. Jesus
therefore enteryng into their congregation, began to teach them as he had
taught other. Here that thing hindered the matter of the gospel, which ought
to have furdered it, because the common sort of men had rather to envy things
that be known and familiar, than favor them, whereas they make much of
strange things, fondely and foleshely, esteming a thing therefore to be goodly
because it cummeth far of. Therefore when Jesus was known here of certain
which knew the lowenesse and symplenesse of his stock, and the pouertye of
his parents, and also the art whereby Joseph (commonly thought to be his
father) found and nourished his wife and her son, knowing also that Jesus
was of the same art, and where as they never heard say that he was brought
up in learning, thus they mutter and murmoure among themselves: how has he
this notable wisdom? or fro whence has he power to show miracles? Is not
this Jesus the carpenter, Joseph the carpenters son? Is not his mother poor
and a meanne womanne among us, which is called Marie? Be not his cosens with
us, James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Do not as many as be his next kinsfolks
dwell here with us? How is it than that he suddenly being made an other manne,
returns unto us preaching, and mighty in miracles? Does he think that he is
unknown unto us? So the kindred and the poor estate of Jesus, did offend the^,
and made them to stumble, thynkyng as yet nothing of him but as of a man, and
one of the common sort of people, and for the old poorenes and lownes of his
life, envying the new renoune and honor. But Jesus rebukyng their gross and
over rude judgment, esteming a man not for his virtues, but for fortune and
nobility of birthe, A Prophet is not without favor sau^ in his own
country.
says unto them: A prophet is no where less set by than in his own
country and in his own familye, and among his own kynsfolkes. And where in
other places he was redely believed, and showed many miracles, here he did
weorke none, but that with laiyng on his hands, he healed a few that were
sick. Not because his power was straighted or diminished, or his will
changed, but because their unbelief did let it. For like as a physician cannot
profit the sick if he reiecte his medicine: not because the art of the
phisician is not effectual, but because the sick man is in fault: so because
it is the faith unto the which miracles be given, unbelief is a let to him to
show them forth, which lacks neither power nor might, but that he was
^etted by the defaulte of others. Therefore Jesus reprouyng them for so great
malice, said: This is no new thing ye now do unto me. The same chanced in
times past to the holy prophets Hely and Helisee, whose tumbes ye have now in
veneracyon. For when it rayned not three years and a half, and therefore a
great famyne was throughoute all that countreye: Helias being in danger for
hunger, was commanded to go to no ^other wedow, whereas ^here were many in
Iewry, but unto the stranger in Sarepta, in the country of the Sidonians. Of
this woman only was he received, and found faith, and wrought a miracle.
Further in the time of Helisee, there were many lazares in the nation of
Israel, and yet for all this there was none healed but only Naaman a Sirian,
whose faith in a manner forced the Prophet to show a miracle.

The.xiiii. Chapter.

IN the mean time Herod the Tetrarche of Galile, the son of him which
had slain the children of Bethleem, heard the rumor and fame of the
doctrine and miracles and wonders of Jesus: of whom when the multitude had
diverse opinions, sum saying that he was Help, sum that he was Hieremye, and
sum that he was one of thold prophets, and there were that said that he was
John, who restored again to life, was becum now more mighty. Herod laughing
them to skorne, said: I did cut of John's head, and how think ye that he is
alive, and not only alive, but also to be mighty with miracles? Furthwith
when he was certifyed by diverse, of so many and so notable wonders, that the
rumor now could not appear false, he said unto his servants. He of whom
they tell such great wonders is not Jesus, which of la^e was killed of my
father in the noumbre of the children of Bethleem, but it is John which is
risen from death: and therefore he is now becum more divine and godly, and is
notable by miracles. For Herod had laid hands upon John Baptist, For Herod
had taken John. etc.
and cast him into prison: although he had the man in estimacion, and did many
things after his advise and counsel. But this favor of the tirau^t was
turned into hatred, for the unchaste woman, whose favor and love obtained by
fylthy service, could do more with the king, than the authority of John. For
he had taken unto him for displeasure of his brother that was alive, Herodias
his brother Philippes wife: by whom also Philippe had a daughter. John
monished the king frankly and freely, and told him that the marriage was
unlawful, both because his brother was alive, and there was a daughter alive
also which his brother had by her. Further, Moses law bade that the brother
should mary ye wife of the brother departed, And when he would have put him to
death* etc,
if it chanced him to dye without children. Herod, loving the woman the more
outragiouslye, the less it was lawefull for him to love her, was greatelye
offended with this lyberty, insomuche that he would have slain him but that
he feared the styrring of the people, with whom he knew that John was greatly
in favor, because both he baptized many, and had many disciples, and was
thought of many to be Messiah. Truly every man thought him to be a man endued
with the spirit of prophecy, and of great holiness. But afterward excess
and ryote, and unreasonable love toward the maid his niece, shaked of this
fear. For when, after the manner of the heathens, he did solempnisate the day
of his birth, upon the which there was al manner of voluptuous pleasures used,
Herodias daughter daunsed at the kings table, with wanton gesture, and so
pleased Herod, which was now warm with wine, that he swore that he would
give unto the maiden whatsoever she asked, yea if she would ask half of his
kingdom. The wenche, lest she should leefe so great opportunity, and by and
by to abuse this filthy lust of the kings heart, she counseled with her mother
what was to be asked. She fearyng lest the kings mind being reconciled
again to John, might break of the incest marriage, counseled her daughter to
ask nothing, but that furthwith she might have the head of John Baptiste
given unto her in a dishe. The wenche by the counsel of her ungracious mother
came into the feast, and every man loking what she would wish and desire:
she asked forthwyth that she might have given unto her the head of John in a
dyshe, as though her mother would esteem and make more of this dyshe, than of
half the kingdom. When they heard this, otherwise than they looked for, the
king counterfeyteth heaviness in his countenance, and alleges for a cloak of
his cruelty, the fear he had to break his oath; chiefly because he made it
before so many geastes, and lest he should seem light or perjured, he
commanded that the thing which the wenche desired, should be done. By and by
the executours of death were sent into the prison, and the head of the
innocent man was cut of, and was brought in a dishe, and given to the wenche,
the wenche gave it to her mother which was the chief deviser and doer of all
this matter. And thus luckely was the birth day of Herod celebrated. This
reward was given unto him that moved and called to honest things. With this
sight were the iyes of the geastes fed whom the king did vouchsafe to set at
his table. Therefore the unchaste woman had John's head.

But the disciples of John carried away his body and buried it. When Jesus by
the telling of John's disciples, knew of this so cruel a deed (for as man he
suffered it to be told unto him as though he knew it not, whereas he knew it
before it was done) he departed into a ship, that being separate from the
multitude, he might go into some desert and secret place, showing a certain
apperaunce of manly fear, but in deed cutting of occasion from the wicked
king, that he should not heap murder upon murder: Chiefly since the time of
Jesus was not yet come, and therewith also teaching us to give place sumtime to
the furies of princes, lest they being provoked and cha^ed with well doings,
both hurt the innocents, and they themselves be made the wurse. It is lawful
to shun the wicked, ready to do ungraciously, that we may profitte and
help the good men. And this going aside declares the notable faith of
certain. For as soon as it was heard that Jesus had left the cities, and was
abidyng in desert, for fear of Herod as they thought, they went out of the
cities into wilderness to him, which hid himself in secret places: and
because they could not go to him by bote or by wagon and such like, for the
^ombrouse places, they followed him on foot: neither feared nor discouraged by
the hardness of the way, nor by the daungier of lack of food. So gredely now
they began to hunger for the doctrine of the gospel. Jesus perceiving that,
cummeth out of the dark corners, and came to mete them that were desirouse of
him, like as he withdrewe himself from the wicked. And when he saw a great
multitude of men flockyng thither, which brought with them many encoumbred
with diverse dyseases, he moved with pitye, and consyderyng and perceiuyng their
faith by the dyfficultie and hardness of the way, of his own accord he
healed all that were dyseased. And so great was the feruencye of the
multitude, that where as they brought with them into wilderness sick folks,
children, and many women, yet they brought no vitail with them. Therefore when
the night now drew nere, and their stomakes were pricked with hunger, the
disciples which had seen so many miracles, having not yet thoroughly a perfect
opinion of Jesus (for so it was thought good unto the divine wisdom to frame
them by little and little unto perfeccion, to the intent the faith of things
that were done, might be the more firm and sure, and to teach them withal, by
what means they should heal and help the infirmity of others) put their
master in remembrance that night was at hand, and the multitude was great,
and that it was high time than to take meat and to send them away, that they
might go into the next villages, and every man to provide him of vitailes.
Give ye the^ to eat. etc.
But Jesus, to the intent the miracle might be the more evident and open,
answered: They need not to go any whither, rather give ye them to eat. But
the disciples as though they had forgotten all that they had seen, nothing
awaked at this saying, aunswerd very grossly, but so that their wekenes set
forth the grea^nes of the miracle: shall we (quod they) give a supper to so
many, where as we be but thirtene^th noumber? we have very littel vytaile,
truly nothing else, but five barely loaves, and two fishes. In case they
despise not and loathe not this supper, how shall it suffice them which will
scarce suffice us few? Than Jesus commanded whatsoever they had to be brought
unto him. And he commanded ye people to sit down. etc.
The disciples obeying simply, not disputing ye matter thus: than ye kill us
with hunger if ye give them this little that we have, they brought their whole
vitailes. Here Jesus exhibiting an evangelical feast, where like as it
behooves to be none excess, so it is mete there should be an equality of al
things: He commanded them all to sit down upon the grass, so that fyfties
should sit together, that the noumber of geastes might better appear. And
also he followed the manner of them, which making a feast or geuyng a dole to
many, divide the multitude into companies, that no man should lack and no man
have to much. This done, Jesus than at length taking upon him to be a feaster
and a feder of the bodies also, which came to feed the souls, and to teach
in deed his disciples that they should never lack food, which being given
unto the gospel, regarded little their vitaile: took in his hands the five
barley loaves, and two fishes: first declaring unto al men with what manner of
vitaile ^he Apostolical ambassadoures ought to be content: furthermore showing
plainly before the iye, the sincere faith of the multitude, which seeing how
little vitayle there was, and was not ignoraunte how many thousand men there
were, commanded to sit down, sa^e down. Therefore Jesus the feastemaker,
holding in his hands the bread and the meat, lifted up his iyes into heaven,
showing that whatsoever is needful to the use of man, it cummeth from the
heavenly father, and when he had praised his bountifulnes and liberality, he
brake the bread and fishes, and so delivered them unto his disciples, that they
should set the^ before the people, putting them in remembrance, as it were by
a dark figure, of what sort ye doctoures ought to be, which feed with the
word, the minds of the simple. For as Christ loking up into heaven, declared
that he taught nothing, but that came from the heavenly father, so the
Apostolical men as often as they see the people to depend of their mouth, with
a plain and a simple faith, they should deliver nothing unto them, which
they had not received of Christ, nor should not propose unto the^ sundry
deinties out of the shops of worldly philosophy: neither bring out unto them
human doctrine after their own affeccions, but should distribute unto the^,
the simple and plain evangelical doctrine, as they had received it of their
master: nor should not otherwise cut it and mince it than he had broken it
with his hands, for by such manner of preparacion both many be refreshed,
and the glory redoundeth to Christ, and not to the dystributour. Wouldeste
thou know the end of this feast? The disciples doubtyng nothing made
distribucion: and they doubting nothing fell to their meat on al hands, not to
excess, but to sufficiency. And the feast of such a number lacked nothing, in
so much, that wha^ supper was done, the scrappes furthermore that were
gathered up, filled twelve baskettes. And the noumber of men was five
thousand beside women, and children.

These things done, Jesus desyring to teach, that after that the necessity
of the body was satisfied, we ought not to go unto wantonness, or sleep, but
unto prayer: unto which prayer solitarynes is most mete: he forced his
disciples (for it grieved them to depart from their dear Lord) to go to the
mere and to row over the water before, and he would come after, when he had
sent away the people. But they although they departed from him against their
will, yet they murmoure not, they make not their excuse that the night was at
hand, they ask not when he would follow, but they obey symply his
commandments. Therefore when they were gone, Jesus sendyng away the
multitude, whom he had satysfyed by all means, went up to a hill to pray
there alone. For so he taught his disciples to pray. Therefore in the top of
the hill, Jesus was alone a good part of the night. And the disciples in the
mean time, their lord being absent, as they rowed in the water were in
peril. For as they entered upon the water, by and by there arose a contrary
wind, and the ship was tossed, not without peril of the swellyng waves of the
water. The night made their fear double. What should they do? They were in
daungier, and he was not there whose help they might call upon. Jesus left
his disciples in this peril, almost all the whole night, to harden them by
little and little against all fears, and to teach them that the help of God
shall never lack to them that be in peril, although it come somewhat late.
Therefore at length about the fourth watch of the night, they almost
being in despair, and now sore amassed in their mind, and ready to give over
out of hand: Jesus came, not in a boat, but walkyng upon the waters. They
when they saw one walkyng in the dark, and knew not Jesus well, they were
more a fearde and said among themselves, it is a ghost that we see, and not a
man. And the common sort of shippemen thinks that such manner of syghtes,
do sygnyfye utter destruccyon to them that row on the water. Therefore they
were so sore afearde, that being almost beside themselves they cried out for
fear. But Jesus suffered them not to be in daungier any longer, but by and by
spoke unto them that they might know him by his speech, Peter answered and
said. etc.
whom in the dark they could not see. Be of good chere (quodhe) it is I,
fear not. At this word by and by their mind was comforted. But Peter which
always had a synguler love toward Jesus, thynking nothing at all hard that he
would command, said: Lord if thou be he command me to come unto thee
upon the water. For he meruelled not that Jesus walked upon the water, but he
thought that he himself might do so likewise, if Jesus would. But Jesus
framyng and fashioning his weakness by all means unto the strength of
perfect faith, bad him come. At the which word Peter nothing lyngeryng,
leaped down out of the boat, and began to haste to Jesus, walkyng upon the
water. And as long as his faith nothing wauered, the moyst^ element served him.
But when he cast his iyes a little from Jesus, and began to look about him,
and to considre the boysteousnes of the wind, the hurling of the waves, and
his own feebleness, he was afraid again, and began to sink down and be in
danger of drowning. Fear came of the boysteousnes of the winds, peril came of
fear, and fear of distruste. And again the greatenes of peril raised up the
spark of faith, and now being almost overwhelmed with waves, he cried out:
Lord save me, I perish. But Jesus putting his disciple in remembrance, that
the peril which he feared came not of the waves or winds, O thou of little
faith etc.
which before served his turn, but of the weakness of faith, reaching out
his hand catched him and lift him up, saying: O thou that yet have little
trusted me, why did thou waver? For it is not enough to have a strong faith
for the time, but it must be continual and constaunt, nor thou must not look
how great the peril is, or what thy strength is hable to bear, but what I am
hable to do to him that does trust and believe in me. Therefore furthwith as he
entered into the ship, the wind ceased. And they that were in the ship,
seying such a merueylouse wunder, perceyuyng that there was somewhat in him,
more than man, fell down at his feet and wurshipped him, saying: Thou art the
very son of God. And when they came to the bank, he went into the country
of Genezareth, where he had showed many miracles before. They after that they
had knowledge that he whom they had seen before, was come again, they sent
throughout all the country to tell that Jesus was present that if they had any
sick folk, they should bring them. For now their faith began to increase, by
the miracles that were done before. Therefore flockyng together on every side,
they offer unto Jesus as many as were diseased, desyring him that at the least
they might touch the hem of his garmente, if it were to paynful for him to
touch them one by one, or to speak unto them. So strong was their faith, and
their faith deceived them not: For as many as touched him, were healed.

The.xv. Chapter.

TO the more glory of God these things were done, the more the Phariseis were
fret with envy, seeing their glory to be darkened thereby, by the which glory
hitherto they had magnifyed themselves among men. They hu^ted in every corner
for a quarrel, but the more they go against Jesus, the more they blase abroad
their own blindenes, being so manifest and open, that the people also spyed
it. Therefore certain Phariseis of Jerusalem (for there were they most
arrogant and proud) go together unto Jesus, that the number might make their
false accusacyon to be believed. And where as Moses forbade that any thing
should be taken away or put to the words of the law, the Phariseis, that
they might seem to be not only thexpounders of the laws, but also the
makers, they added certain tryflyng things, as be those: That no man should
take meat with vnpure hands, which they called unwashed, as who should say,
the hands did defyle the meat or the man, or as who should say, the licour
of the water should wash away the filthynesse of the mind. Again, that no
man retournyng from the market and had been amongeste the common people,
should eat meat, but he had first washed his body: as who should say, the
touching of men filed man, or as who should say, he is pure and clean which
is washed. Again, that their flagons, pottes, brass, stoles beds, and other
stuff which was daily occupied* should be often washed. With these and many
like superfluouse and tryfling things, they burdened the simple people, which
things they would have so much made of and honored, that for these
precepts, they neglected oftentimes the commandments of God. Therefore when
they could no ways leye to the disciples charge, the transgression of Moses
law, they find fault with their master, because he suffered his disciples
to neglect man's constitucions: not that they despised them, although they
were worthy to be despised, but that being given to seriouse and earnest
matters, sometimes they passed little upon them. Therefore they spoke unto
Jesus and said: Why do not thy disciples keep the constytucions of their
forefathers? For they wash not their hands when they go to meat. Christ not
suffering so maliciouse rebuking, for a thing of nothing: pays them home with
a more sharp rebuke. Nay with what face do ye, which pick quarrels for these
^^^fles, make so much of man's constitucyons, which can bring nothing else
but paynfull supersticion, and yet for them, ye stick not to break the
greatest commandment of God?

For God confirmyng the law of nature, commanded earnestly that every man
should honor and succoure his father and mother, promising long life and
felicity of this life unto the doer hereof: threatening death to him that does
the contrary. But you following your avarice, that ye may turn that to your
own gain and advantage, which should have been bestowed in helping of your
parents: do teach that it is holyer and better for men to enryche the temple
with gifts* than to help their nedye parents: and ye have showed a cast,
how the children may mock their parents asking help and succor of them,
that is, to say thus to the father or mother: the gift that I offer to the
temple, think it bestowed upon you. For that, that is offered (...) God the
high parent, is rightely bestowed, and the godliness of the son shall profit
the parents: and by this craft, under the color of false godliness, against
the commandment of God, the father is forsaken, that the priests may be
better at ease. The thing cummeth to you, to the help and succoure of the
parents, nothing cummeth but words. And ye color a wicked deed under the
pretense of godliness. What can be more arrogant than to prefer your
constitucions before the commandments of God, and under the pretense of
them, to hyndre and break the holy commandment of God? It is a wi^ked deed
to burden the people with such manner of constitucions, which is over burdened
with the burden of the law. But it is intolerable wickedness utterly to
abolishe gods law, agreeable unto the law of nature, through your own
inuencions.

This is your counterfeite religion, which is nothing less than as it
appears. O Hipocrites, Esaias worthily prophesied of you, saying: This people
honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. And they
wurship m^ in vain, teaching doctrines, which be ye precepts of men. Jesus
when he had spoken these, as though he had turned away from the phariseis,
which hunted for nothing, but for occasion of false accusing: commanded the
multitude to come nere, saying: Hear and understand how trifling things they
be, which the phariseis prescribe unto you, careful in little things, and
neglecting great things. They with aukewarde judgment, put the chief point
of godlynes in outward things, as in choice of meats and neglecte those
things that be of the soul. They abhor unwashed cups, and neglecte
unclean souls: they wash their hands and their skins oftentimes, but they
suffer their mind to be defiled with all manner of vices. That which enters
into the mouth makes not man unclean, but that which goes out of the mouth
makes man unclean. For it is no matter what meat a man eats, but with what
mind he eats it.

Jesus seemed by these words to have given unto the phariseis a just occasion
to reprove him, because he took away the choice of meats, which gods law
prescribed. In which thing also his disciples did not disagree from the
phariseis, thinking it a wieked thing to eat common and unclean meats, which
truly Christ did not yet condemn, but declared that they of their own nature
were neither good nor ill, but of incident causes, and therefore less to be
esteemed than those things, which always and of their own nature be godly or
ungodly, and declares also that such manner of precepts of the law, which were
ordained for a time, and do not so much bring holiness as signify it, begin now
to be obscured and darkened, and shortly shall vanysh away and perish at ye
clear light of the ghospel. The disciples not yet understanding this thing, go
unto their lord, and monish him secretly of the danger, saying: know ye not
that the phariseis although they dissemble the matter, be offended with this
co^municacion of yours, yt meat defiles no man? But Jesus minding to teach
that th offense of ill men, which rises of things of nothing, and the doers
of it also, ought manfully to be despised: chiefly when in obeying of the^,
none other good rises of it, but increasing and nourishing of their malice:
not without the undoing of the simple people, Every pla^ which my heavenly
father has not planted etc.
which trusting to such manner of obseruacions, neglecte the devotion of true
godliness, answered thus unto his disciples which were sumwhat offended also.
Every graffe that my heavenly father has not graffed, shall be plucked up by
the roots every ordinance yt men have inverted of themselves for their own
glory, and not for true godliness, shall perish and come to naught. These
things savor of the earth, and be carnal, made and given for a time, to
repress and keep under the excess and outrage of gross folk. The law of the
gospel is spiritual and heavenly, nor rests in these visible things, but in
thaffeccions of the mind. These therefore ought chiefly to be regarded: For
without these the other profit nothing but to vain ostentacion. Seeing therefore
ye have begu^ to profess this heavenly philosophy, ye have nothing to do with
ye cou^terfeiting and dissemblyng Phariseis, who promise perfect holiness
through such obseruacions, in which is no godlynes, or surely very little. They
show and boast themselves to be doctors and captains to true religion,
whereas they know not in what things true religion stands. Therefore they be
blind, and leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind on the
way, what shall happen? both together shall fall in the dyke. They know not
what they teach, and they take unto them folishe and gross disciples.
Therefore let the folishe Phariseis go, with their folyshe and unprofitable
constitucions. Regard and care for those things which make man clean or
unclean: that is to say, for those things which do defile or cleanse the
mind, rather than the body.

To these Peter made answer, not yet persuaded, because of the supersticion
which he had depely received of his forefathers, that these constitucio^s
could not be neglected without danger: whereas he durst not resist any more
the sayings of Jesus, required him gentilly that he would vouchesafe to
declare plainly the thing which he had spoken darkely to the people,
concerning things that goes in and cummeth out of the mouth. Jesus minding to
sharpen the desire of his disciples with a little chidyng, which should have
been now more cunnyng in understanding of parables, and out of one to have
diuined and gessed another, said: Be ye also yet without understanding?
understand ye not that meat which received and taken with hands washed or
unwashed, enters into the mouth, goes down into the stomach and afterward
the grosser part of it is cast out by the belly into the pryuye? These be
bodily things, and affect and touch nothing but the body. As for the solle
they neither help nor hurt, unless a man misuse them. And to misuse them is
not the fault of the meats, but of the misuser. But the things which go out
of the mouth be the things which men do speak. Talking cummeth not from
the belly but from the heart. And that is in man's heart, that in deed is pure
and clean, or else vnpure and unclean. For from that fountain do spring
noysom thoughts, wherewith me^ go about to lie in wait to hurt their brother,
from thence do spring murder, adultry, rape, theft, fraud, deceit, envy,
arrogancy, strife, false witness and blasphemy. These things though they go
not out by the mouth, yet they make men unclean and abominable in the sight
of God. If they burste out in manner of a pestilente breath out of a filthy
siege, like as they declare man to be unclean, so with their infeccion and
blasting they do defile others also. But whether thou take thy meat with
hands washed or unwashed, so thou take it to the use of nature, makes not man
unclean. Neither drink taken out of an unclean cup, defiles not man, so
thou take it mesurably for the use and not for the excess. Likewise to sit
upon an unwashed seat, does not defile the mind of man, like as the washed
seat does not make pure and clean him that sits in it. Therefore whereas
the Phariseis teach and observe supersticiously these folishe trifles, yet
they do not abhor those things, whereby the mind is defiled in deed. They
lie in wait for him that does them good, they do subornate and prepare false
witness, they do backbite the fame of their neighbor, and so seek for their
own glory, that they envy the glory of god, falsely reproving the works which
be done by his spirit and ascribing them to Beelzebub. They should abhor
these things, if they would seem clean in deed. But what aukewarde kind of
holiness is this, to have washed and clean hands, and to have both mind and
tongue defiled with so many mischeuous vices?

After that Jesus had spoken these things, he left that country, and went
into the coasts of Cyrus and Sydon, in manner prophesying with that deed, that
the Jews through the supersticion of their law, should expel the doctrine of
the gospel, which the Gentiles through sincerity of faith should take unto
the^. For Cyrus and Sidon were inhabited of Idolaters. Jesus went thither, not
to preach as he did in Iewry, for the time was not yet come, but to be secret
and hid there, for he entered into a house desiring to be secret, but the fame
did utter him. This was done for the invincible malice of the Jews, lest they
might complain that the wicked and profane Gentiles were preferred before
them. Therefore he would that ye miracle that he showed there, should not seem
to be sought after or done of purpose, but offered by chance, and in manner
extorted and obtained of him by force. Therefore when the rumor was spread
abroad, that Jesus was present, whose fame increasing by little and little went
beyond the coasts of the Jews: a certain woman of Canaan cu^ming out of her
coasts durst not come nere to Jesus, And behold a woman of Canaan
lest she being unclean might seem to defile him which was clean, but a far of
called upon him with a miserable cry: have mercy upon me the son of David,
telling him that she had a daughter at home miserably vexed with a devil. This
Jesus so merciful and easy to be entreated, which was wont to be prompt and
ready unto al men, to the intent both that he might make open unto al men the
very constant faith of the woman, and also leye unto the Jews charge, their
very styffe and obstynate unbelief, and to teach us with all, of what efficacy
and power importune and earneste prayers powered out of an humble heart, be with
god: he despises the peticyoner which cried out for sorrow of her heart,
insomuche that he would not vouchesafe to make her answer: showing thereby a
certain fashion of the Jews arrogancy, because the Jews counted the Cananees
their old enemies, and wurshippers of Idolles, to be abominable, and that
they be defiled if they do but talk with them. And the apostles at that time
were yet of the same affeccion and mind. But the woman ceased not, although
she were repelled. Sorrow and faith made her importune, she follows at his
back, and cries lamentably: have mercy upon me lord, the son of David. The
disciples not yet understanding what was in dooyng, moved with shame rather
than with pity, because of the importune crying of the woman, of a strange
country, speak unto Jesus, not desyring him to have mercy of the wretched
woman, but because of her importunity to send her away with some answer.
Therefore Jesus made an answer more sore and hard, than the former repulse
and shaking of, to the intent he might make the constancy and coldenes of the
strange woman more marueilouse: and also by the example of her to charge the
Jews with their pride and arrogancy. But he au^s^ered and said.
I am not sent (quod he) but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. For
the Jews stood merueilously in their own conceyte, because of this title,
that they were the stock of Israel. The woman was not weryed with so many
repulses and denials, insomuche that she durst yet draw nere unto Jesus, and
falling down at his knees, said: Lord succoure me.

She did not confute the saying of Jesus, but with often repeting of her
prayers she went about to weary him. She laid not for her, right and justice,
she requires nothing but mercy. Jesus not content with this, goes on still,
to try the sobre importunity of the woman. It is not mete (quod he) to take
the childrens bread, and cast it to the dogs: calling the fruit of the
gospel which is by faith, bread: calling the children, the Jews, which did
glory that they had god to their father: calling the dogs, strangers, and
aliens from the religion and wurshipping of God. Which of the Jews would not
have been stirred and angered with such a rebuke? but the woman not refusyng
the name of a dog, enuieth not the Jews the honorable title of the children,
but calls them also lords whom Jesus called children. She embraces the
answer, rebukeful in apperaunce, and takes occasion of it not to be
repelled, wherewith it appeared that she was utterly repelled. I deny not (quod
she) that the Israelites be the children, and we the dogs, and therefore I am
not vttrely to be repelled. I take not away from them their fine and delycate
bread, which they eat sitting at their fathers table: This only I require,
which masters are not wont to deny to their dogs. The table is rich and
plentiful of such things it suffices me if I chance to have the crummes
which fall from their tables. Than Jesus maruaylyng at the insatygable and
great constancye of the strange woman, O woman great is thy ^^yth.
in manner overcome, said: O woman, I can no longer resist thy prayers, great
is thy faith, wherewith thou constraynest me. Wherefore beit unto thee after thy
desire. And by and by even at the same time it was proved, that her daughter
was delivered from the devil.

When Jesus in manner constrained had wrought this one miracle in the borders of
ye Sidonians and the Sirians, to provoke and stir up his own people, he went
again into Iewry, to declare how more ready he was toward his own country
men, then to strangers: if they might have been overcome and wunne with
benefits. And he came unto a mere which is called the sea of Galile, and
there going up upon an hill, sat down, that by going aside and by the
difficultye of the place, he might a little and a little pluck up the faith of
his disciples, and make it firm and stable. Anon there flocked about him many
flocks of men, bringing with the^ du^me, blind, lame, weak, and diverse
other vexed with diverse diseases, of whom there was so great a multitude,
that they cast them at the feet of Jesus. He well perceiving their faith by
the hard and cumbrouse journey, healed them al: and so spedely healed so many,
that the multitude which came unto him was much amassed, seeing how sodeinly
the blind received their sight, the du^me spoke, the lame walked, the feeble
was whole of lymmes. And they gloryfyed the god of the people of Israel,
which did vouchesafe to bestow so great benefits upon his people.

This kindenes of the people caused him to heap benefit upon benefit of his
own accord. For when Jesus knew that the multitude tarried and bid by him
three days (such was their feruency toward Jesus) and knew also if they had
brought any vitayle with them, it was consumed and spent a good while before:
and that many were in ieopardy for hunger. Furthermore that the journey was
long, and that there were no villages nor towns nere: he called his disciples
unto him and said: I have pity on this multitude. For now it is three days,
that they have ^aried with me in desert, nor they have nothing to eat, and I
will not send them away fasting, lest they faynte in the way, being longer
than they be hable to go fasting.

With these sayings he put his disciples in remembrance of the former
miracle, when he fed certain thousands of men. But they yet rude and
forgetting those former things, being careful and doubtefull as though they
had been commanded to feed such a great multitude of men, do make answer:
Where than can we get such a deal of bread that may suffice such a great
multitude? This simplicity and forgetfulness of the disciples, did set ^urth
the greatness of the miracle. They therefore being in despair. Christ takes
in hand, the matter of the miracle. He asks the^ how many loaves they had.
And he commanded ye people to sit down on ye ground.
They answered, seven, and a few fishes. And forth with he commanded them to
sit down upon the ground. And taking the seven loaves and the meat in his
hands, after that he had lifted up his iyes unto heaven and given thanks unto
his father, he brake them and delivered them to his discyples, and they
distributed them to the people. Every man did eat his fill, and there was
nothing lacking: insomuch that seven baskettes were filled of the gatherynges
of scrappes, which remained. And there were of them that did eat, in number
four thousand, beside children and women. But Jesus, so many miracles showed
in the mount, lest he should styrte the people overmuch to have him in
veneracion and honor* chiefly when these bodily benefits be applied and
given for none other intent* but to obtain authority to the doctrine of the
ghospel, whereby the souls be healed and fed* after that he had sent away the
multitude, he went by boat into the land of Magedon.

The.xvi. Chapter

Jesus being here, there came unto him again certain Phariseis and Saduceis
being of a contrary sect, notwithstanding of one consent and agreemente to lie
in wait for Jesus. And craftily they require him to show some token from
heaven, as though hereafter if he would have so done, they would have
believed in him, where as they went about nothing else, but to seek occasyon to
reprove him. But Jesus when he perceived that after so many miracles, they
remained yet in their malice, mourned in the spirit and said: Ye hypocrites
vtteryng one thing with your mouth, and cloking another in your heart, in less
things when ye mark heaven, ye can tell before what weather shall follow the day
after.

O ye Hypocrites. etc.
For when ye see the sun go to glade, ye say: to morrow shall be fair wether,
for the air is clear and bright. Again when ye see the sun rise in the
morning, by and by ye give sentence, that that shall be a foul and a boystiouse
day because the lowering air is red. When ye see the fashion and countenance
of heaven, ye can guess whether the time will be mete for iourneing, rowing,
sowing, or mowing, or for any other things apperteyning to the use of the
body: And are ye so dull and negligent in knowledge of the time, that makes for
your souls health* Ye have the scriptures, ye see what things be done, ye see
how the world is renewed, and understand ye not yet, that the time spoken of
before by the Prophets, and looked for so long time, is now at hand? Of one
sign ye give sentence, of fair or foul weather, of so many signs, which ye
see daily, do ye not perceive the thing that is present? If ye would have been
made better by wonders and miracles, ye would have believed me long agon. Now ye
require a sign and a token to be the worse thereby. O naughty and adulterous
generation, which goes far out of kind from her forefathers, of whose
tytles, she magnifieth her self. She seeks craftily for a wondre out of
heaven, to pycke a quarrel and to reprove it: But in time to come she shall
have a sign that she shall fear and not reprove. In the mean time she shall
have no sign nor wondre but out of the earth, which shall frustrate and
disapoynte all their endeuoures, when they shall see him alive again, whom
they thought to be dead and buried. It seems a monstruouse thing unto them
which chanced to the Prophet Jonas: they shall have a like monster, but more
wondrefull. By this riddell and dark figure, the Lord Jesus signified that he
should be first slain, and buried of them, whom they thought to be nothing
else but man, and forth with should rise again, through the power of God.

Jesus therefore leaving them with their blindness, went over the water by ship
and the disciples had forgotten to provide themselves of bread before they
entered into the ship. For they had but one lofe in the ship. Jesus
therefore to put them in remembrance, said: take diligent head and beware of
the leaven of the Phariseis and the Saduceis: noting and touching darkely their
Iewishe supersticio^, because they thought it a great matter to eat these
meats or those meats, whereas they were taught before, that man was not
defiled with the things that entered into the mouth. The dysciples although
they understood not what it mente, were yet monished with this saying, that
they had forgotten to put vitayle in their ship. Jesus therefore chideth them
being careful for this thing, blamyng their dullness, which taught so often
both with sayings and dooinges, utterly to cast out of their mind
carfulness for vitayle, yet were encumbered with carke and care for such
manner of things: O (quod he) ye that so litell trust to me, why do ye vex
your mind with this carefullnesse, that ye have forgotten bread, as who
says, we shall lack any thing, O ye of little faith* etc
although ye provide not for it? Did not I teach you that first of all the
kingdom of God must be sought for, and that these things shall be cast
unto you? Have ye not seen now twyse that such a great multitude lacked not
meat? So many ways taught and monyshed, understand ye not yet? remember ye
not yet? Is your heart yet blinded with such manier of cares? and see ye not
after the Phariseys fashyon, that which ye see with your iyes? and that
which ye hear with your cares, is yt as though ye heard it not? have ye
forgot that, which was lately done, your selves being not only witnesses but
also ministers? When that five thousand men were fully fed with.v. barely
loaves and two fyshes, the number of geastes being so great, the preparacion
so small, how many baskettes did ye fill of the scrappes which remained of
the feast? They answer him, twelve. And again when four thousand men were
filled with seven loaves and a few fishes, ye being the dystrybutoures, how
many baskettes filled ye with the scrappes? they answer seven: Why, do ye
not yet understand the manner of my speaking, which ye turn to the care of
bodily things, whereas my talking studieth and provides for the minds,
rather then the bodies?

Now ye should of your selves have coniectured what my riddel meant when I
said: beware of the leaven of the Phariseis and Saduceis. I had now taught
you, that it little skilled what kind of meat we eat. I had now diversely
declared and beaten upon it, that they which have in hand the matter of the
ghospel, should utterly cast away such vile cares.

The disciples being more attent and diligent by this little chyding, understood
that Jesus meant that they should take heed diligently, and baware of the
doctrine of the Phariseis, which had nothing that was sincere and clean, but
was corrupt with ambicyon, auaryce envy, and other vices: Whereas the
doctrine of the gospel tasted of no such thing. For their doctrine does
rather infecte man, than feed him, and therefore it must be taken head of
dilygently, because they be woonte for to deceive unware and simple men by the
false cloak of godlynes, which is the very poison of true godliness.

Here when Jesus came into the coasts of the city called Cesarea, which
Philippe the Tetrarche so named in the honor of Ceasar, following his brother
Herod, which changed the name, and called that Cesarea, which before was
named the tower of Straton, he thought to prove how much his scholars had
profited by hearing so much communicacion, and by seeing so many miracles: and
whether they had any higher or better opinion of him, than the vulgar sort.
Therefore he demands of them saying: whom do men talk that the son of
man is? They say: some say that he is John the baptist. For so the Herodians
suspecte. Some say that he is Helias, because he was taken up: and they suspect
that he does appear now according to the prophecy of Malachy. Some say that
he is Hieremie, because he was a figure of Christ, and that it was said of
him: Behold I have set thee this day over nations and kings, to pluck up and
to distroy and to plant: which in deed should be fulfilled in Christ. Jesus
hearing these, to thentent he would get out some more certain and higher
profession, says: ye (quod he) which should know me better, who say ye
that I am? Here Simon Peter as he loved Jesus best, as the chief of the
Apostolical order, answered for them all. Thou art very Christ, the son
of God alive: not speaking of suspicion, but professing certainly and
undoubtedly that he was Messiah pronused of the Prophets, and the son of god
after a certain singular manner. Jesus delighted with this chereful and
substaunciall profession, said: blessed art thou Simon the son of John. The
affeccion of man taught thee not this word, but the heavenly father put it in
thy mind, by a secret inspiracion. For no man has a worthy opinion of the
son, but by the inspiracion of the father* which only knows the son. And
I again, lest thou should adourne me thankelesse with such a noble
testimony, assure thee of this, that thou art very Peter that is to say, a
sound and a sure stone, not wavering hither or thither with sundry opinions of
the vulgar sort^: and upon this stone of thy professyon, will I build my
church, that is to say, my house and my palace: which being set upon a
sure foundation, I will so fortify, that no power or strength of the kingdom
of hell shall be hable to beat it down. And I will give unto thee. etc.
Satan will come upon you with many engines, he will raise a coumpany of
wicked spirits against you, but through my defense my buyldyng shall stand
imprennable, only let this sure and sound profession abide. The kingdom of
heaven is the church, the kingdom of the devil is the world. Of this no man
need to be afearde, so that he be Peter, that is to say, like unto thee. And
the keys of this heavenly kingdom I will deliver unto thee. For it is meet
that there he be first in authority, which is first in the professyon of
the faith, and in charity. And truly this kingdom of heaven is in earth, but
it has to do with heaven, whereof it does depend. Wherefore he that is
entangled with sins, does belong to the kingdom of hell, nor can not enter
into the kingdom of heaven. But he shall enter if he profess that which thou
doeste profess, and be losed from his sins by baptism, and so through thy
leading and thy opening of the gates, he shall enter into the kingdom of
heaven. This is my peculiar and proper power, to forgive sins: but this power
I will give unto thee after a manner, that that which thou shalt lose, with my
keys received of me, upon earth before men, shall be losed also in heaven
before God. On the other side, that which thou shalt bind in earth, shall be
bound also in heaven, for God will allow thy judgment cummyng from his
spirit.

Than charged he dis disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus
Christ. From that time forth began Jesus to show unto his disciples how
that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders, and
hye priests, and Scribes, and must be killed and raised up again the third
day: And when Peter had taken him aside, he began to rebuke him saying:
Master favor thy self, this shall not happen unto thee. But he turns him
about, and said unto Peter: go after me Satan, thou ^ynde^e^^eme, for thou
sauerest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men. When Jesus
had spoken these things, he commanded his disciples that they should as yet
keep this godly opinion of him, secret with themselves: nor open it to others
that he was Messiah. For first the sacrifice of the cro^se must be
accomplished, and the verity of his manly nature declared, and further by his
resurreccion, and the holy ghost, his divinity must be declared. For
although the voice and sentence of Peter, was praised of Christ, as the
sentence of them which now began to profi^e and spring up by little and
little, unto things of more perfeccion, yet they dreamed of a certain
kingdom* not utterly unlike a worldely kingdom. And therefore Jesus darkely,
and as in a riddle, promised unto Peter the right of the keys, but he
delivered them not by and by. For as yet he was not mete to use them, as yet he
was not suffycyently taught with the instruccion of the holy spirit. And
therefore Jesus calls them back to the mystery of the cross and of his
death, by the which mystery that kingdom must be prepared, the devil once
overcome, and sins abolished, that they might be the less troubled in
their minds when they should se things chance which they knew should come to
pass a little after. They desired rather to glory in the mighty and high son
of the living God, but no man can truly glory in him, but he which is not
offended with his humility and lownes. Jesus therefore began to prepare his
disciples to this storm which was at hand, showing them that he must first go
to Jerusalem, and that he should have many griefs and displeasures of the
Scrybes and Phariseis, and also of the chief priests, and finally that he
should be killed, but on the third day rise again. When the disciples being
yet carnal understood not fully this communicacion, because they judged these
things unmeet and unworthy for him, who thorough so many miracles declared
himself to be the son of God, yet they durst not demand of their master
what it meant to dye and rise again. Therefore Peter who for the special love
that he had to his master, was bolder then the other, takes him aside from
the other of the Apostles, as though he would tell him a thing more
familiarly: and chyding him, and abhorring the speaking of death and
afliccions, said: Lord be good to your self. These things shall not happen
unto you. For it is in you that they come not to pass: For although Peter
pronounced him to be the son of God alive, rather by the instigacion of the
father, then by his own reason or wit: yet he was far from the understanding
of that mystery, that Jesus by his death should redeem mankind, and by his
resurreccyon declare unto the world the might of his divine power. Therefore
Jesus to refourme this affeccion in his disciples, turned unto them, and
beheld the^ whom he knew to have like mind and affection (albeit only
Peter durst blame the Lord,) and said unto Peter: Come behind me Satan. Be
not against the will of my father: it is thy part to follow me, not to go
before. Now thou dooeste withstand, and endeavor to leat that thing which
both my father wills to be done, and also it behooves me to do, for the
health and salvation of mankind. Thou desireste to be a fellow of the
kingdom, and thou art against me making speed unto the cross of mine own
accord, to thentente I may win and get this kingdom to my father: what way
ye see me go the same ye must go also to the kingdom of heaven. But thou
sauereste not yet the things which be of God: but led by man's affeccyons*
repyneste against the will of God. Resist not therefore, thou unprofitable
counsaylour, but follow after me, becum rather a scholar then a master.

When that with these sayings Jesus had cut the comb of Peter for his
importune frowardnes, turning to all his disciples began to declare at large
what it was that he said to Peter: come behind me. Whosoever (quod he) will
be my disciple and partaker of the kingdom of heaven, let him follow my
steps. And like as he sees me despysyng all the goods of this world, to
bestow my life also willingly for the salvation of men and glory of my
father: so must he also refuse and cast of all humayne affeccions, ready to
all kinds of death, for the gospels sake, and take his cross and follow me,
which am going to the cross. So to suffer is a blessed thing: so to be
rebuked is a gloryouse thing: so to be killed is a winnyng of life. I know
there is nothing more dear then life: but so every man must lose his life, if
he will save it: and except he lose it, he shall lose it in deed. He loses it
for advantage that loses it for the gospels sake. He loses it in deed which
forsaking the gospel, provides for this temporal life, and loses the life
everlasting. There is no man so foolish that would win this whole world
with the loss of this corporal and short life. For what does it profit a man
if he wiue all ye world. etc
To what purpose serve richesse if the owner perish? So it is a mad man's
part to make so much of his affeccions, of richesse, or else of his body,
which within short time should perish, yea though no man kill it: that for
men's pleasure he will lose the life everlasting, which whosoever has not, has
all the other in vain. Therefore nothing ought to be so dear unto any man,
the gain whereof he would change with the loss of his soul. For the loss
of other things may some ways be recompe^ced, the loss of the soul cannot
be recovered. He that loses his life for my sake, does not lose it, but
commytteth it to me for advantage, and shall receive it again with lucre, when
the Majesty of the kingdom of God shall appear.

Nor ye ought not to be dyscouraged in your mind because I have showed you
that ye must suffer much adversity for the ghospel. They shall have an end
shortly, and everlasting glory, shall follow the temporal ignomyny and rebuke.
For the son of man whom ye shall see oppressed and trodden down of all men
and counted for a wurme: For ye son of man shall come. etc.
shall come once in an other lykenes, and shall show unto all men the Majesty
and glory of his father, being guarded and accompanied with his angels. Than
he that was judged here and condemned with a shameful death, shall be the
judge of all men both quick and dead, and shall yield a reward unto every
man according to his deeds. Than shall they be appointed to everlasting
death, which here regarded more their life tha^ me: and they shall be rewarded
with immortal life which for my sake despised ye life of the body for a time.
Now is the time of strife and travail, hereafter shall be the time of rewards.
And truly this felicity shall than be made absolute and perfect, when it
shall be seen good unto the father. For it belongs not unto you to know
the time. And yet in the mean season there shall be given to you, a certain taste
of this glory. For be ye assured of this: there be sum here sta^dyng which
shall not taste of death, before that they see the son of man showing the
majesty of his kingdom, as it may be seen with bodily iyes. Surely before
death they shall see the kingdom of God show forth his power: and now by little
and little, vanquyshe and ouercum the whole power of this world.

The.xvii. Chapter.

AFter six days, Jesus willing by sum means as it were by a dream, to show
unto his disciples, that sight and apperaunce in the which once he shall cum
to be judge of the world: he chose out three of the number of his disciples,
Peter, James, and John his brother: and when he had brought them up into a very
hye hill, far from the sight of men, he was transfigured before them. And his
face shyned like the sun, and his garments were bright with whytenesse as
white as snow, and as no fuller can make upon the earth, and there appeared also
to them, Moses and Helias talkyng with him of the glory of his death, which he
should suffer at Jerusalem. This was thought good to Christ, that ye Apostles
should be confyrmed by those auctours, whom all the Jews magnified most, and
that they should not suspect that he would abolish the law, since Moses stood
with him: nor the prophets, since Helias was present: neither y^ they should
abhor his death as a shameful thing, which so great men set forth, and
showed it to be glorious. These things were seen to the apostles as to men
newely waked from sleep: for their iyes were heavy and grieved. For mortal
feblenesse was not of capacity to receive the greatness of the vision. The
disciples therefore being afearde and amassed with such a wonderful and
incredible sight, Peter not yet fully well advised, but ravished wholly with
the pleasure and majesty of the sight, which seemed to be far from mention of
death, said: Lord let us build here three tents or pauilyons, one for thee,
another for Moses, and the third for Helias. This was thought unto Peter more
wisdom than to be slain at Jerusalem. Peter had not yet ended his
co^municacio^, but behold a bright and pleasant cloud ouershadowed
thapostles, lest they should be absorpte and ouercummed with the highness of
the sight. And behold the voice of the father sounded out of the cloud,
witnessyng of his son, with the same words with the which he witnessed of
him, when he was baptized in Iordane: This is my only beloved son in whom my
mind has delight, hear him. When the disciples heard this voice full of
divine majesty, and not to be borne of man's ears, they fell down grouelyng
upon their faces, and were more afeard. For they were afeard of their life,
because they had learned that God said thus: man shall not see me and live.
But Jesus receiuyng again his former shape, touched them with his hands, lest
they should suppose that he were a ghost, and with his accustomed and known
voice he comforted them, saying: Arise and fear nothing. Further when they were
cum to themselves, and lifted up their iyes, they saw no man there but Jesus
alone, even like as he came unto the hill.

And when they came down from the hill, before they came to the cumpany of the
other disciples, he commanded them to tell no man of these things that they
had seen, until the son of man were risen from death. For until that time the
tale should be unprofitable, and not believed. And the disciples kept it to
themselves, and conferred between themselves what it might mean, that Jesus
said: after that he be risen again from death. Their heart was so wrapped and
entangled, that that word so often heard, ^ould not enter into their heart.
But a certain doubt rose in their minds of that that they saw Helias standing
with Jesus, this doubt they propose unto him in the way. What meneth it than
(quod they) that the Scribes teaching and tellyng of the cumming of Messiah, be
wont to say out of the authority of Malachie, that before the cummyng of
Messiah, Helias Thesbites shall cum. And he went not before thy cummyng, but
this day was seen in the hill. Unto whom Jesus making answer, said: Truly
Helias shall c^m like as Malachias said: and according to his prophecy shall
go before my cummyng, and shall restore al things, the residewe of the people
of Jews being converted unto the gospel, lest the whole nation should be
condemned. But this cumming shall be in time to cum, when I shall be here
again with the majesty of my father, renderyng reward unto every man
according unto his deeds. And yet a certain Helias went before this my cummyng
also, Helias is cum already.
whom the Jews despised, even as they did me, and did unto him not after his
deserts, but whatsoever it pleased them. And the son of man shall be
handeled of them with like mekenes. Than the disciples understood that he
called John Baptiste Helias, for the lykenes of life, and freeness in
reprouyng of kings.

But now when Jesus went unto his disciples, he saw a great multitude of men
about the^, and the Scribes disputyng with them. The people meruelyng whither
Jesus was gone, ran unto him and saluted him. He demanded of them what the
matter was that they disputed among themselves. Than one of the multitude made
answer: Master I brought my son to thee, which is miserably vexed of an
unclean spirit: which as often as he takes him, the child is beaten against
the ground, sumtime he is driven into the fire, sumtime into the water, he
fometh, he gnasheth with his teeth, and co^sumeth away. And because I could
not have you, I desired your disciples to cast out the devil, and they could
not. But Jesus to heal the unbelief of all men, cries out in manner angerly: O
nation unbelieving and without faith, how long shall I be among you in vain, O
faythles and crooked nation, etc.
how long shall I suffer your intractable and froward manners? I have done so
many miracles and profitte nothing: and therewith commanded the child to be
brought, because the miracle might be the more evident and ^otable to all men.
Which when he was brought and seen of Jesus, furthwith even there before the^
al, the spirit took him, and the child was hurled upon the ground, and
tumbled and fomed: a miserable sight to see. Tha^ Jesus the more to declare ye
greatness of the disease, asked the father how long it was since the child began
to be vexed with this disease. The father made answer and said: from his
infancy, and not without danger of his life. For oftentimes he drove him into
the fire, sumtyme into the water to destroy him. I know that it is a soore
disease, yet if thou can do any thing have mercy upon us and help us. Jesus
hearing (if thou can) sumwhat reprouyng the weakness of his faith, as who
says any disease were of greater might than the power of God, says unto him:
Ask not what I am able to do, but look what thou art able to believe. For if
thou trust fully, nothing is so hard but it may cum to pass to him yt does
believe and trust. At this word the father conceiuyng a trust, and a more sure
hope, with plentiful tears criyng out, made answer: Lord I believe, and if
any thing want in my trust and belefe, supply thou it of thy goodness, and help
my unbelief. In the mean time when Jesus espied the multitude of people
runnyng to gase, desirous to see whether the thing that came not to pass to ye
discyples should cum to pass to Jesus: he threatened the unclean spirit,
saying: thou deaf and dumme spirit, And Jesus rebuked the devil. etc.
I command the go out from him, and teturne not a gain unto him hereafter. But
the spirit went from the child with howlyng, yet first he tore him and vexed
him so vehemently that he lay for dead, and many warranted that he was dead. So
strong and tough was the violence of the disease. But Jesus taking the child by
the hand, lifted him up: and he arose. Like as the father did hardly believe: so
his son was hardly heled.

In the mean season the disciples were heavy in their minds, fearing lest
thorough their default they had lost the power of doing miracles, whereas before
they had gloryed that deuilles also were obedient unto their word: before the
multitude they keep silence for shame. But when Jesus was cu^ into the house,
Why could not we cast him out. etc
they go unto their master and demand of him: why could not we cast out this
devil, since this power was once delivered unto us from thee? Jesus to confyrme
the faith and trust of his disciples, which ought to be so great that sumtyme
it might help the distruste of others, says: The weakness of your faith
partly was the cause. For the violence of the disease was vehement, and the
fathers faith weak and waueryng, and your faith was not so mighty, that it
was equal and hable against both these difficulties. For it is sumwhat werish
with man's affeccions, and faultye by the reason of the leaven of vaynglorye.
And ye had faith like the seed of mustarde, which being vile and little, yet
when it is broosed, it shows a sharp quicknes of her nature, and sowed in
the ground springs up into a large tree nothing should be so hard, but with
a word it should be brought to pass out of hand. Yea if ye should say to the
hill, remove from hence, and go into an other place, If ye have faith as a
grain of musterd. etc
it would do it forthwith as it was commanded. But this kind of deuylles
wherewith the child was possessed, is not cast out, unless faith be confirmed
and strengthened by prayer and fasting. The violence of the disease was strong
and tough, and by continuance of time, it was turned into nature. Against
such manner of faults we must fight with fastings, which do subdue the body
being brought low, unto ye spirit, and also with prayer, which obteyneth the
help of god. By this co^municacion Jesus taught that grievous, vehement, and
much accustomed dyseases of the mind, must be driven away with strong and
vehemente remedies.

But now Jesus when he was in Galile, to the intent he might fortify, and make
strong the minds of his disciples, lest they should be over much troubled with
his death, again he does iterate and beat it into the^, that the son of man
must be delivered into the hands of men, and killed of them, and that the
third day he should rise again from death. This saying did grieve the minds
of ye disciples above measure, which so loved their lord (albeit their
affeccion and love was yet carnal) that their ears could not suffer any
mention of death. For they could not understand that Moses and Helyas called
the death of Jesus a glory and renoume, and that that death should bring health
and salvation to the whole world. And although, like as they were heavy and
fadde at the mention of death, so they ought to have been chereful and glad at
the mention of the resurreccion: yet their mind abhorred so much from the
remembrance of death, that surely they understood not what it meant to dye,
and the third day to rise again. For they thought it better utterly not to
dye, seeing that he was hable to do that, which was hable to revive again
from death.

After that he came to the city of Capernaum, they that demanded tribute in
Cesars name, being afraied to speak to Jesus because of his authority, which
he had gotten him now by miracles: they went to Peter whom they saw in manner
next about him: Does your master (quod they) pay a didram for tribute? Peter
whereas he had no money, and would not offend ye gatherers of tribute, made
answer that he pays. For Jesus hitherto had paid such manner tributes. And
when they were now entered into the house (for Jesus had an house there) Peter
being perplexed, thought in his mind to speak to Jesus, as touching paime^t of
the tribute. For he had promised, and had not to pay. The^ Jesus not ignorant
what Peter had in his heart, prevented his question. Simon (quod he) what
thynkest thou? Of whom be kings wont to take tribute or subsidy, of their
children or of strangers? Of strangers quod Peter. Then (quod Jesus) the
children be free: signifiyng thereby though sumwhat darkly, that he being lord
of the land and the sea, and of all things, owes tribute or subsidy to no
mortal prince, and that his disciples, as the children of the kingdom, be not
bound: but yet minding to teach that in such things which make nothing
against godliness, obedience ought to be given to this kind of men, lest being
provoked they offend more grievously, he added: yet (quod he) lest we offend
them, go to the sea and take the fish which cummeth out first, open his mouth,
and thou shall find a piece of coin called a Statere which is four dra^mes.
Take it, and give it for me and the. With this deed Jesus both showed his
power, whereby he was subject to no man, and his modesty, whereby he would give
place unto the^, who^ it is not mete to stir or provoke for a thing of little
value, and to be set nothing by. For he that can give after that sort, is
greater than he that ought to give: and yet when he gives that he ought not,
he teaches that it is better sumtime for to give over thy right then to strive
for thy right with them that be froward, chiefly in those things which
diminishe thy substance, but hurt nothing godlynes. The world has his order
which must not be troubled in no case, by occasion of liberty of the gospel.

The.xviii. Chapter.

AFter that these things were thus done, there entered into the minds of
thapostles, a certain worldly affeccion, and a prycke of envy and ambicion.
They heard of the kingdom of heaven, they saw three Apostles led a part
into the mountain, they heard that the keys of the kingdom of heaven were
delivered unto Peter, and that it was said unto him: blessed art thou Simon
Bariona, and upon this stone I will build my church, they saw him talkyng
with their master of certain things both familiarely and boldly, and even
now they saw him preferred before the other Apostles in paime^t of tribute, and
in manner made equal unto Christ, therefore they sumwhat envied Peter, unto
whom the principality of the kingdom of heaven seemed to be appointed, where
as he was younger in years. Therefore they go unto Jesus, and demand who
should be chyefe in the kingdom of heaven. For yet they dreamed upon such
certain dignities, as we see in princes courts. But Jesus to pluck this
affeccion utterly out of their minds, called to him a certain child, and
set him in the mids of his disciples, a little one, and yet far from all
affeccions of ambicion and envy, Except ye turn and becum as children. etc.
simple, pure, and living after the only course of nature. Be ye sure of this
(quod he) unless a man be wholly changed, and cast away utterly all such
affeccions, and be transformed into ye fashion and simplicity of this child,
he shall not once be received into the kingdom of heaven. So that in no wise
preeminence and soueraintie ought ambiciously to be desired. Wherefore whosoever
does submit himself and becum like unto this babe, in that he humbles himself
to be as the least of all, he shall be greatest in the kingdom of heaven. For
whosoever through modesty and sobrenes, makes himself as least, the same is
greatest in virtue. Princes love them that be like unto them, and among them
is he most esteemed, that prefers himself before others. I delight in my
like. In courts of this world the prince thinks it to redound unto his
rebuke, if a man use any of his nobles co^tumeliously: and he takes the
gentilnes to be bestowed upon himself which is bestowed upon them. But the
favor of true, simple and humble me^ is so great with me, that whosoever
receives any one of these for my sake, I would it should be counted as done to
my self, even as though he received me. Contrariwise, whosoever hurreth or
offe^deth any one of these little ones which trust in me, and depend wholly upon
me, he shall be more grievously punyshed, than if he should be drouned in the deep
sea with a millstone at his neck. For what is more wicked than to offend the^,
which bear to no man ill will, which envy no man, which prefer themselves
above no man, Woe unto the world because of offices. etc.
which love all men indifferently? But alas, woe be to the world for
offendyng and greuyng of like little ones. The frowardnes of men is cause that
offenses must needs chance. There shall be men, which stirred up with ennie and
hatred, will persecute them that do for them, will say ill by them that wysh
them well, will kill them that bring everlasting health. And truly these
offenses and griefs shall profit them that shall suffer them, yea they shall be
profitable to all the world. But yet it shall turn him to displeasure,
thorough whose defaulte this offense shall rise.

Therefore they that desire to enter into the kingdom of heaven, let them
diligently avoid the offenses and griefs of little ones, but rather let the^
help one an other. And it is not enough to beware that a man offend not
another, but also to take heed that he offend not himself. For then they be
offenses in deed, when a man is an offense unto himself. Therefore let not
affeccion be so dear unto any man but that forthwith it be cut of, if it be an
offense and a let to him that hastes to the kingdom of heaven. In so much
that if thy hand or thy foot, that is to say a membre most necessary, be
offe^siue unto the, it must be cut of and cast away. For it is better for thee
to be received into the life everlasting maimed or lame, than with perfect
hands and feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if thine iye hyndre the
pluck it out. etc.
The iye is not only a necessary membre to be used, but also very pleasant
unto man. And yet in case it offend the, pluck it out, and cast it away. It is
better for the to be received into everlasting life with one iye, than to be
cast hedlong into hell fire with both iyes perfect and whole. But Jesus
speaking thus, meant not that any membre of the body should be cut of, but that
all affeccions should be cut of, which withdraw us from the care of
everlasting salvation. For a friend whom thou can uneath forbear, is as it were
a man's hand. Thy father upon whom thou staiest, is thy foot: thy wife or thy
child whom thou love te^derly, is thine iye. Therefore as there is nothing
that ought to be so precious, and nothing that ought so highly to be esteemed of
man, whereby he ought to be withdrawn from the kingdom of heaven: so no man be
he never so poor, so base, and humble, ought to be despised but helped rather
to cum forward to better and better. Ye have an example, see therefore that ye
despise none of these little ones. Although with ye world they be abiectes, yet
with God they be greatly regarded. For this I tell you certainly, angels which
as their ministers have charge of them, do continually behold the face of the
father which is in heaven. Hereof ye may esteem how much they be regarded
with God, since he has appointed them such kepers and guides. They be yet rude
and raw, they may fall, they may be deceived, but their simplicity is worthy
help, and not punishment.

For the son of man came not into the earth to destroy any man, but what in
him is to save al me^. But many will not be saved, and persecute him which is
willing to save. These be they whom the world has in great veneracio^. They
be high in authority, they be mighty with riches, they seem to excel in
learning, they be commended and set forth with a certain marvelous
cou^terfeityng and color of false holiness. Truly such must not be provoked
willynglye, but must be despised stoutely, if they fearyng lest their own
power decay, oppress the power of god: if they sekyng their own glory, envy
the glory of the gospel: if they following their lucre, be against the
profytes of all men: if they boastyng their vain learning, do corrupt the
doctrine of the ghospel: if under the pretense of false religion, they go about
to extinct true religion: if they wexe fyerce and cruel by benefits and good
turns: These manner of men must thank themselfes for their own destruction.
But this ought to be our study and endeavor that we suffer none to perish of
these little and weak ones, which so do err that they be in the way of
recovery, being more like to sheep than woulfes. Conjecture by your selfs what
great care the father (which is naturally good) does take, lest any man
should peryshe, whom he made to the entente they should be blessed. For if
there be a true and faithful sheapherd, lord over an hundred sheep, and one
should be lost of so great a noumbre, would he not leave the nintie, and nine
in the hills, and seek her which is wandered from the flock? and is so grieved
with the lack of one lost sheep, that he would put the whole flock beside in
danger. And if he should chance to find her, certainly I say unto you, that
he will rejoice more for that one gotten again, than for all the other which were
not lost. Wherefore if a man being a shepherd bear such affeccion toward his
flock which he does possess only, but created not, how much more is it my
fathers will which is in heaven, that none of these little ones, whom he has
created, should perish? whom he regards so that he has appointed his
angels to the keeping of them, and has bestowed his only son to call them
to salvation.

Therefore away with offenses from your company, which break brotherly peace,
but let there be mutual charity, whereby ye may lovingly help and heal others
faults if any chance: and the way to heal shall be this. If thy brother do any
thing against the which is worthy to be looked upon, lepe not out forthwith to
vengeance, neither again suffer him not by thy silence to be lost, whiles that
he sins freely and at large, drunken with his own affeccio^s: but first try
him with a very gentle remedy which shall not so much as put him to any
shame. Go unto him alone, and debate ye matter betwixt you, none other being
by. If he do not acknowlage his fault, reprove him and lay it before his iyes,
If he hear the, thou have wunne thy brother.
how much he has erred from the duty of brotherly charity. And let thy
monicio^ be such yt it may declare the to seek nothing else but his health, and
the restoryng of old amity. And if he be so curable that he cum to himself at
this secret monicio^, there is no cause why thou should revenge or put him
to open blame: it is enough for the, that thou have wun thy brother. And in ye
mean season thou have gained ^y it. For thou should have lost a friend, and
God should have lost a soul. But if the disease be so grieuouse that it cannot
be healed with this light medicine, yet thou must not utterly despair, nor
forthwith run to the extreme remedies. But if that he will not hear the alone,
go to him again, taking with the.i. or.ii. either that he may be amended with
sum little shame which shall be no infamy unto him, or else that he may be confuted
and ouercum by the testimony of two or three. But if he be so intractable that
he will be moved neither with shame, nor with fear of judgment, bring the
matter to the congregation, yt he may be reformed either by the consent of the
multitude, or by thauctoritie of them which be rulers over the multitude. But
if he be so far past cure yt he will not be corrected neither by secret and
brotherly monicion, If he hear not the congregation.
neither by the knowlage and consent of two or three, neither by the shame of
his fault uttered and disclosed, nether by the authority of the chief rulers,
leave him to his disease. Let him be cut of from the congregation, and taken in
none other wise but as an Heathen or Publicane. Let this be the greuousest
punishment among you, which notwithstanding is used for none other purpose,
but that the brother either should cum unto himself by shame, considering that
he is shunned and fled of all men, or else le^t he being mingled in the flock,
should hurt other with his infeccion. No man ought to say unto me, the
judgments of thy kingdom be but werish and weak, nay they be very severe
and sore, if a man will contemn the^ obstinately. For man's laws, when they
punish a grievous offense with death, they do nothing but kill the body, and
sumtime they kill him whom god does not condemn, and they kill only and amend
him not, for he is not alive to be amended. But this conde^nacion although it
proceeds leysurely to punyshme^t, yet for this cause it is very severe and
sore, that he that is condemned, unless he do repent, is punyshed with
everlasting pain, which by no means he can escape. Whom Caesar does condemn,
god sumtime does assoyle: and whom the prince does assoyle, god su^tyme does
condemn. The prince who^ he does assoyle, he leaves in the cumpany of me^, to
make other like himself: whom he kills, he takes from the cumpany of men,
not only not healyng him, but making him in case that he cannot be healed.
These ^e man's judgments, rather necessary than praise worthy. But your
sentence so remoueth a man that is incurable, that he cannot infecte them that
be good: and yet he is in case that he may repent: because that ye have power
to save, and not to destroy. And yet they shall not sin unpunished, who^ ye
suffer to have their life. He shall be punyshed eternally, god being his judge,
whose sentence shall approve and confirm your sentence, unless the condemned
person repent. For he that seeks not reue^ging, but the amendment of his
brother, he that is ready to forgive the injury doe^ against him, he that
willingly cu^meth unto the sick to heal him, being offended himself, he that
once or twice repelled, yet cease not to help and heal, he that trusts not
to his own judgment, but takes one or two unto him, not to revenge, but to
heal: this man's sentence because it cummeth from an evangelical mind, god
will allow and never will break it, unless the condemned person will condemn
that that he has done. Although therefore your judgment has not in appera^ce
such severity and sharpnes as the judgments of princes have, yet it is more
to be feared than their sentence, wherewith oftentimes the best be condemned
and the most sinful assoiled. It is a terrible thing to be condemned of god:
and he is condemned of him, whosoever is condemned of you, agreing together
with a sincere mind. For that that ye judge by the spirit of god, is not your
judgment, but his by you: but if ye condemn a man by the spirit of man, than
it is man's judgment and not gods: and he that by your judgment is cast out
of your c^^pany, is not forthwith banished from the cumpany of heaven.
Therefore the strength of your authority rests in affeccions, which only god
does behold and see. Truly these be the keys which I will give unto Peter
professing me: wherewith that that shall be bound in earth shall be bound al^^ in
heaven: and that yt shall be losed in earth shall be losed also in heaven. This
power though it be specially mete for the heads and chief, yet I will give it
to al men, if so that they have a consent and agremente among them, not of
man, but in my name. Yea and moreover I will say unto you, your consent shall not
have authority only in pardoning and condemnyng offenses, if ye with me and
among your selves do agree: but also if any two be found in earth which do
truly agree in my spirit, that is to say, not moved with the affeccion of
man, but jointly loving the things that be of god: whatsoever they ask they
shall obtain it of my father, which is in heaven. Such love has the father
toward the evangelical and holy concord. Therefore forasmuch as ye may do
so much with the prince that is almightye, ye need not to repent you of your
power and authority: although before men ye appear feeble and weak. That
which is asked of Ceasar, is not forthwith obtained, nor he is not able to
perform whatsoever is asked of him. For he cannot put away the agewe, or make
the dumme to speak again. But there is nothing so hard or incredible which my
father will not give you, if ye ask of him with one consent and agreement.

After that Peter had heard these things diligently, supposyng that all that
Jesus had reasoned of condemnyng and assoylyng, pertayned chieflye unto him: he
conceived in his mind a certain doubt, because that Jesus saying (after the
third reprouyng, let him be unto thee as an Heathen, or a Publican) seemed to
appoint a certain nu^bre: which who so passed, although he that had offended
did repent, yet he should not be received unto grace. Therefore to be more
exactly taught in this thing, he went unto Jesus: lord (quod he) how often
shall I pardon my brother if he offend me, and after what number of faults
shall he be repulsed from pardon? After the seventh fault? This noumbre Peter
did propose as great enough, whereas Jesus made mention, but only of the
third reprofe. Than Jesus showing that in these things which be done against
us, we must be very gentill and easy in forgeuenes: I do not say (quod he)
that ye must forgive unto the seventh fault, but unto the seventy times seven:
showing that no noumbre ought to be prescribed to a christian forgeuyng: but as
often as he that has offended does repent, so often even with the heart his
offense is to be forgeuen: utterly pluckyng out from a christen mind all
desire to revenge. And lest that any man should think it hard and unjust,
Jesus teaches it to be very equal and just by a similitude. For this is not
so much a cleme^cy as a recompense. For wha^ we offend sumtyme against our
neybour, but much more both oftener and more grievously against God: who^ as
often as we offend, the more grievously we sin, the greater that he is against
whom we sin. And ye greater benefits that we receive of him, the more
unworthy we be to obteyn pardone either of our neybour, or of God (who does
pardon him that sins a thousand times if that he repent) if we think it
much to pardon our brother offendyng much less, chiefly since god does
forgive us our trespasses on this condition, that we moved by his example,
should be gentle and easy to be entreated toward our neybour. Therefore (quod
he) the kingdom of heaven is like a rich and a mighty man: who having a
great family, thought to take a count of his servants.

And when he began to count, he found one that ought him ten thousand
talentes. And when the sum was greater then the detter was able to pay, ye lord
commanded both him and his wife and children, and all that he had to be sold,
that the creditour might be contented with the money that was made. But the
servant falling down with meke suite at the lords knees: I pray the (quod
he) to grant me sum respite, and in process of time I will pay the al. And the
lord having compassion of the servant which humbled himself before him,
granted more than he desired. For he did not only not bring him into the
law, but forgave him the whole sum.

But that servant being now free and at liberty, when he was goen out of his
masters sight, by chance met with one of his fellow servants which ought
him a little money, that is an hundredth denaries: he forgettyng his masters
clemency toward him, forthwith laid hand upon him, and ^ega^ to pluck the
miserable man, saying* pay thy det. This fellow servant falling down at ye
knees of his fellow servant, beseched him, with as many words as the other
besought his lord and master: deal patiently with me, and I will pay you al.
But the creditour would not be entreated, but repelled the humble sutour, and
plucked him into prison, till he had paid his det. Now the other fellow
servants which had seen the meruaylous clemency of their master toward the
servant, when they saw so great cruelty of their fellow servant, moved with
great grief and sorrow, declared unto their master all the matter toward his
fellow. Tha^ the master stirred with anger called unto him his servant, whom
he had pardoned al. Thou naughty servant (quod he) did not I being thy master
forgive the such a great sum, for none other cause but that thou made
humble suite unto me? was it not mete therefore that thou being a servant,
should forgive thy fellow servant a little money, and have compassion upon
the humble sutoure, like as I had compassion on the? Surely so great gentleness
of mine toward thee, ought to teach the gentleness toward thy fellow servant.
And now the master being sore angrye, delivered him to the tormentours to be
kept in prison until he repayed the whole sum that was forgeuen before. After
this example your heavenly father will deal with you. Every of you is in det
unto him much more, whom every man often does offend. Men also do trespass
against men, but yet far less. But unless every man forgive his brother,
and that with all his heart, lighter offenses done against him, the father will
not only not forgive you the greater trespasses done against him, but also will
revoke and call back those which he had forgeuen.

The.xix. Chapter.
And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings, he departed
from Galile, and came unto the coasts of Iewry beyond Jordan, and much
people followed him: and he healed them there.
AFter that Jesus with this communicacion had instructed and framed his
disciples unto well doing toward the simple, and unto gentleness toward the
offenders, he left Galile and went over Iordane, into the coasts of Iewrye,
as going toward his death to cum, which the Phariseis secretly went about.
And thither also followed many flocks of people, bearyng with them diverse
sick and diseased: and he healed them there.

And again the Phariseis seeing so many wonders, and the love of the multitude
toward Jesus, began to renew their envy again. Who craftilye and
subtillye came unto him, taking occasion of the communicacion wherewith he
taught before that the wife ought not to be repudiate and cast of. Therefore
they propose a question with two pykes: whether it were lawful for a man to cast
of his wife for every cause. And if he had answered: It is lawefull, he should
seem contrary to himself, whereas he taught that divorce is not lawful: if he
had denied it, he should seem to have been against Moses law, which does
permit for every cause to give a book of divorce, and to send her away. But
Jesus so does tempre and order the answer, that he hurts not the authority
of Moses, nor recanteth not his doctrine, and stops the mouth of the
Phariseis, which were skilful in the law, by the authority of the law. Have
ye not red (quod he) that when god made mankind, he ordered the first
matrimony so, that one was coupled unto one with a knot that could not be
broken? For he made both man and woman of one piece, that by the imbracyng of
these, mankind should spryng further, and by and by expressyng the indissoluble
knotte of the man and of the wife, not Moses, but God himself the maker of the
marriage, said: For this mutual charity, man shall forsake father and mother,
and be fastened and coupled unto his wife. And this couplyng shall be so strayt
and fast, that of two, in manner, shall be made one person, which before were two.
Therefore once joined in matrimony, they be not now two, but one body: in so
much, that it is as far against nature to separate the wife from the manne,
as to cut away a membre from the body. Therefore that which God has knyt
once together with so strayte a bond, let no man separate.

Here the Phariseis, Why did Moses the^ co^mau^d. etc.
thinkyng that they had caughte now an occasion to catch Jesus: if god (quod
they) meant this that thou do say, why than did Moses give husbands leave
to cast of their wife for every cause, so that they give her a book of
divorce? how durst he permit that which god would not to be done? Jesus
answered: He did not permit you this because it was right and good of nature,
but knowing the hardness of your heart, he suffered the lesser ill, that ye
should not commit the greater. For he does not allow divorce which had
rather suffer that than murdre. And the book of divorce does not make that the
divorce is right and good: but it witnesses thy hardness, which wil^e cast of
thy wife for every light cause, and prouydeth her of a new husband, taking away
liberty from the, that thou shall not call her again once cast of. But from the
beginning whereas the malice of man was not yet increaced, nor the nature of man was not yet infected with so many vices: because there was not so cruel
hatred, that poysonyng or murdre should be feared, there was no license of
divorce: and the same law shall not now be loced and set at liberty, after
that the doctrine of the Gospel does renew and make perfect the synceritie
of nature. Moses wisshed the same that I do teach, but your manners bent over
much unto murdre, put him in fear, that he durst not require this of you. I
who do not abolishe the law, but make it more perfect, plainly say unto
you, that it is unlawful and against the mind of God, and against the will
of Moses, which ye do commonly: refusyng your wives for every cause. And it
is not therefore right that ye do, because ye do it without punyshemente:
There be many myscheuous things before God, which be not punyshed by man's
laws. Therefore ye shall understand that whosoever casts of his wife for
every cause, and maryeth an other, both commits aduoutrye him self, and
gives also a cause of aduoutrye to his wife, unless she whom he does leave
of, has deserved diuorcemente by aduoutrye. For she that has given an other
manne liberty over her, ceasseth now to be wife, and has taken away from
her self the right of matrimonye, the flesh being divided, which God would
have to be one and undivided. But he that for such causes leaves his wife,
for which ye oftentimes do cast her of, if he couple himself to an other,
it is not matrimony, but aduoutrye. And who so maryeth her so cast of, he
maryeth not his own wife, but an other man's, and therefore he does not
marye, but commits aduoutrye. But the whole of all these mischiefs does
redounde to him that is the refuser and caster of. For first he is stubburne
and cruel, which neither could bear his wives fault, nor would go about to
amend it. Furthermore he gives her that is driven out of his house, which
cannot live without a husband, an occasion to commit aduoutrye.

The disciples hearing these things, say unto Jesus: If married men be in
this case that they cannot be dispatched from their wife, if she dysplease
them, it is better to forbear matrimony. For it is an hard bondage to suffer
at home a waywarde, a brawlyng, and a dronken woman, or else paynful^ and
grievous with sum other like fault. Jesus did not reprove the answer of his
disciples, whom he desired to be free from the bondage of matrimony, because
of preaching of the gospel: but he does them to understand, that it is no
sa^e and sure thing to flee from matrimony, unless a man be of so fyrme and
stable mind, that he is able utterly to abstayn from the act of matrimony.
But there be very few that can do so because that this affeccion of the body
is so common to all men, that there is none affeccion more violente, or more
invincible. Therefore though it be a greater fredome not to be tied in
matrimony, yet is it more sure to be kept within the bonds of matrimony,
than to be defiled with liyng here and there. Therefore Jesus showing what was
best, and prouokyng this way with the reward of liberty, Al men can not
comprehend this saying.
dares not yet exactely require that, which in manner excedeth man's power.
All men (quod he) be not able to receive this word, but they only unto whom
it is given of God: who have so great a feruencye toward the holiness of the
gospel, that of their own accord and willyngly can neglecte this affeccion.
For chaste synglenesse has no praise unless it be taken for love of the
evangelical godlynes. For there be three kinds of Eunuchs. One of them
which be so borne, and abhor from wives thorough the defaulte of a cold
nature, or sum other secret affeccion of nature. Another kind of them, whom
men has gelded. The chastity of these men deserves no praise, because it
cummeth of necessity, not of the love of virtue. But the gospel also has his
Eunuchs very blessed, which be not geldynges of nature, nor gelded of men,
but they gelded themselfes, for the kingdom of heaven: not cutting of the
membre of the body, but for love of the gospel, ouercummyng the desire of
matrimony. Ye see victory set out before you, let him try that will, and
knows his own strength: Let him bear away the game that can: They that
contend valyauntlye and willingly, shall not want the favor of the master of
the game. Because co^municacion was of the purity of virgins, and of the
highness of that noble virtue, which chances to few: as by occasion there
is brought in also an exaumple of perfect cleannes, and great modesty:
without the which, virginity deserves no praise.

There were present fathers and mothers, which desired to offer their babes
unto Jesus, that he might lay his hands upon them, and pray for the^: thinking
that likewise as they saw diseases driven away through his touching, so the
touching of Jesus should preserve them from diseases, from falling of houses or
walls, or other like things upon them, from evil spirits, and from other
hurtes, whereby that age oftentimes miscarieth. But the disciples, (who though
they had often times heard many a good lesson of great modesty and coldness, yet
had not utterly shaken of from them man's affeccions) thinkyng it not mete that
the greatness or dignity of their master should be let or weried with the
importunity of babes, and of their mothers, kept them of, when they desired to
cum nere. Jesus marking this, to the intent that he might the better imprinte
evangelical moderacio^ in the minds of his disciples, which does loath no man, be he never so low, suffer (quod he) the children to be brought unto
me: nor let them not, to cum to me. Suffer the children.
For they that be like unto these, be most acceptable unto me: whom though
the world does hate and despise, yet I vouchsafe to have none other in the
kingdom of heaven. What nature does give unto these, the same must godliness
give unto you, if ye will be received into the kingdom of heaven. Therefore the
little babes were brought unto Jesus, and he put his hands upon them, And when
he had laid his hands. etc
inspiring into the little babes (for ye simple faythes sake of their pare^tes)
a secret power through the touching of his holy body. Which doe^, Jesus
departed from thence, geuyng a lesson by the same fact of his, that the little
babes must be satisfied, but yet that we ought not to tarry long with them, but
to make speed to things of more perfeccion.

And lo, as soon as he had done with the children, there cummeth next after
them a young man which talks of perfeccion. But Jesus, like as in the little
babes he showed his disciples an exaumple of simplicity and modesty: so in
the young man being in deed desirous of perfect godliness, but over sore burdened
with riches, he sets before their iyes, how hard it is for them that be
given to riches, to cum forward to ye perfeccio^ of the euangelical godliness:
and how much more ready they be to the cause of the gospel, which possess
nothing, or else very littell of the goods of this world: and yet poverty and
riches stand not so much in possessions, as in the affeccio^s of the mind.
The young man had a devout mind: but because he heard of Christ certain new
and strange precepts, he went unto him, and falling down at his knees asks
him, saying good master what good shall I do to obtayn everlasting life? The
young man called Jesus good to obteyn his good will by fair speaking: whereas
yet he took him to be nothing else but a very man, although of more excellency
than other men were. Afterward whereas he demanded of good, he means not of
every good thing, but of a certain notable good thing, which may deserve
everlasting life. But no mortal man is absolutely good: and there is no work
of men which can be so good, that it may deserve the reward of everlasting
life. Jesus therefore pricking forward the young manne, to have a better
opinion of him, and to call him from the trust of his works, and to cause him
to put the trust of life rather in the free gift and benefit of God, who is
naturally good, and freely beneficial toward al men, answered in this
manner: why call thou me good, or why do thou ask me of good? Why call
thou me good.
But yet if thou desire to be received unto the eternal life, keep the
commandments. And when the young man asked what the commandments were,
(for he had heard him teach that the precepts of Moses law be not enough to
obtain the kingdom of heaven) Jesus to pluck away from all men the trust
of the law, answered: Thou shall not kill, thou shall not commit aduoutrye:
Thou shalt not steal: Thou shall not bear false witness: Honor thy father
and mother: and love thy neighbor as thy self. Al these things have I kept
from my youth. etc,
Than the young manne being sumwhat chered, said: All these have I kept from my
chyldehode: what lack I beside? He looked that Jesus should have answered him:
Thou lackeste nothing. But the Lord showing what difference there was between
the Iewishe righteousness, and the righteousness of the ghospel: between a
good Jew, and a good Christian manne, said: If thou will be perfect, go
and sell all that thou haste, and give the money to the poor: thou shall not
lose thy money, though it be dispersed among many. So to disperse it, is to
lay it up: For in the stead of worldly riches, thou shalt have a better
treasure in heaven. When thou have done this being now at liberty, and
dispatched of all heavy carriage, bare and pore, cum and follow me being also
bare and poor. When Jesus says: if thou wylt, he showed that it was a great
matter: but he added ^he reward. Thou shalt have a treasure in heaven. Anon
he moved him to the love of perfect godliness: Cum, follow me. When the young
man heard this communicacion, he went away with a discouraged and heavy
mind, because he was a Lord of much possessions, and he thought it hard to
leave the^ all at once. He desired to get everlasting life, he desired the
honor of perfeccion: but the thorns of richesse overwhelmed and choked this
affeccion which was a good seed. Therefore he departed home heuily, not
understanding that Jesus did not condemn riches, but the affeccion, and love,
and carefulnes of riches: to which they ca^ scarcely be any less then bond,
that have them. And he would not that always they should be forsaken: but
yet always set little by: yea and forsaken also, if they at any time
withdraw us from the love of the gospel.

It shall be hard for the rich. etc.
When the young man was gone, Jesus tournyng to his disciples (for he showed this
sight for them, because they should at no time repent them of their poverty,
nor be entangled with the love of money:) how hard a thing it is (quod he)
for a rich manne to enter into the kingdom of heaven. Signifiyng, that the
desire of money, and the desire of the Evangelical phylosophye, hardely agree
together: because the one requires the whole man, the other takes unto it
almost the greatest part of man. And to make the difficulty of the thing the
greater, his disciples musing much, he said more: Yea (quod he) I say more
unto you: It is more easy for a Camel to go through the iye of a nedle, than
for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven. For the gate is low and
straight, and it receives no Camels laden with burdens of richesse. For so he
reproved the covetous rich men, unto whom riches, be rather a burden, than
profit, which they bear for others, rather tha^ for themselfes. This saying
because it was not well understand of the Apostels, put in their minds a
certain heaviness, because they were sorry yt so many men for riches sake
should be shut out from the kingdom of heaven. Therefore when the disciples
maruayled much what it should mean that Jesus spoke of the Camel, and the
iye of the nedle, they ask him: If it be so, who than can be saved? For how
many men are there, which can cast away the riches that they have, or not
wysh for them if they have none? But Jesus beholding them, to the intent he would
assuage the heaviness that they had conceived in their mind, declares that
there is sum hope for rich men also to cumme to the kingdom of heaven. To
men (quod he) this is impossible, nolesse than for a Camel to go through the
iye of a nedle: With men this is impossible, etc
but to God nothing is impossible. Only he changes the minds of rich men,
that they will cherefully either cast away that which they do possess, or
else possess the^ as common and not proper, even ready to ^aue them, if the
matter of the gospel at any time require the same. For why should it grieve
them to despise riches, whom it greueth not to bestow their life.

This communicacion which Jesus had with the young man (sell that thou have
and follow me,) made Peter to have sum good hope, which although he were not
rich, Behold we have forsaken all, etc.
yet that that he had, he left it cherefullye, both his ship and his nets,
and followed the Lord. Lord (quod he) behold we have done that that thou
requyredst of the young man: we have left all things and follow the, what
reward shall we have therefore? But Jesus willing to show that this high
praise was not offered to rich men only, but also to poor men: which
gladly forsake whatsoever they have for the gospel sake, for as much as this
virtue is more esteemed of thaffeccion of the leauer, than of the greatenes of
the thing that is left: did not reiecte the saying of Peter although it was to
high and stout for so simple a matter: but teaching that no small reward
shall be rendered for such small things, left of and forsaken with a good
will, Ye yt have followed me. etc.
sayethe. This I warraunte you, that ye which have forsaken nothing for my
sake, but your boats and your nets, but yet with such a will that ye would
have forsaken very great richesse for my sake, and hither to you being bare
and poor have followed me likewise bare and poor, if ye persevere and continue,
in the world to cum when the dead shall rise, and every man shall receive
reward after his deserts, and when that the son of man, (his humilite that
ye now see, set aparte) shall sit in the seat of his majesty, ye fysshers
than being partakers of honor, which are now partakers of af^iccions, shall
sit in twelve seats, and shall judge the twelve trybes of Israel: because they
cumming of the same stock, having knowledge of the same law, provoked with
the same miracles, and benefytes, yet by no means could be brought to believe:
whereas ye mean persons, and unlearned, by and by at my simple bidding, have
left, yea those things whereby ye sustained your life. And this reward shall
not be yours only, but whosoever for the profession of my name, forsakes his
house, his brothers or sisters, his father or mother, his wife or children, his
lands, or any other possession: he shall not lose that which he left for my
sake, insomuche, that he shall have a great gain thereby. Every one that
forsakes house, (...) ^rethren etc.
For in this world he shall receive an hundred fold for the things that he
has left, and in the time of resurreccion, he shall possess everlasting
life. For in the stead of the things that he has left, the which be casual
and vile possessions, he shall possess here in the mean time that precious
Margaryte of the evangelical mind, which is to be esteemed and compared with
no merchandise of this world: In the stead of one house that ye have left, the
doctrine of the gospel shall make open unto you a number of houses thorough
out the world. For one piece of ground many grounds shall serve your
necessities: for one father or mother ye shall have so many as there shall be
old men and old women, which ye shall convert unto the gospel. Ye shall
have so many brothers, systers, sons and daughters, as your equals or yongers
shall be, which by your prechyng ye shall bring to everlasting life. These shall
give unto you every where of their own accord, if ye shall need any thing,
and their affections shall far pass thaffeccions of the^, whom only kindred of
blood has joined unto us. For the kindred of the fellowship of the gospel, is
more nere than fleshly affinity, and they love more vehemently, whom godliness
has coupled together, than they whom carnal birth has joined together. Unto
this great reward, that shall be added also, which is the greatest of all, that
for things which shortly shall perish, ye shall possess everlasting life.
I say not this that the profession of the gospel does teach us to despise
them, whom nature has joined unto us: but such manner of affeccions must be
neglected as often as they withdraw us from everlasting salvation. This great
felicity is set forth indifferently to all men. There is no difference of
fortune, condition, age, or person. But in this estimacion and judgment which
shall be made of God the equal judge, many shall be last, But many that are first
shall be last, etc
which seem now to be first. Contrariwise many which seem now vile, and of
no reputacion with men, shall there be counted chief. There shall be preferred a
common woman before a Scribe, a Publican before a Pharisie, an heathen before a
Jew, a poor manne before a rich, a plough manne before a king: and they that
seemed next to the kingdom of heaven shall enter in last and they that seemed
far of, shall enter in first. The heathen men through faith shall go
before, the Sinagoge through unbelief, shall be set beside.

The.xx. Chapter.

ANd because it seemed a dark riddell that he spoke concerning the first and
the last, he declares the thing that he spoke with a parable, whereby he
shows that men were called to the keeping or observing of righteousness in
diverse ages: and yet all the servants of righteousness have one and the same
reward of everlasting salvation, so that they which be called, labor
diligently in the vineyarde of righteousness. For they have no less, which be
called in the time of Christ, than they which be called in the time of
Abraham, or Moses, or David. And they have no less which be called and
drawn to the service of the gospel being aged, than they whith be children or
young men. The one and the same denary and reward of everlasting life, is given
unto them al. And yet they y^ came late, seem to have greater honor by this
that the liberality of the lord makes them equal to them which came
before. The Jews were first called, but yet the Gentiles called afterward,
be not only made equal unto them, but also preferred before the unbelieving
Jews. The parable is after this sort: The kingdom of heaven (quod he) is like
unto an householder, which went abroad early in the morning to hier
workmen into his vineyarde. And getting certain and bargayning with them that
they should have each of them a denary a piece for their days work, sent
them into his vineyarde: He went out again about three of the clock, and
when ^e same certain stand idle in the markete, said unto them: go ye also
into my vineyard, and I shall give you that shall be mete: He went out again
about six of the cloak, and again about nine, and did likewise as he did at
one, and three of the clock. Again going out about three of the clock
toward night, he found certain other in the market, to whom he said: why
stand where all day idle? They say: because no man has hired us. He says
to them: go ye also into my vineyard.

Further toward night the lord of the vineyarde gives commandment to his
bailey: Call all the workmen and pay them their hyer: so that thou begin with
the last and cum to the first. Therefore they that came last, that is about
eleven of the clock, and labored in the vineyarde the least part of the
day, were called first of all, and a denarye was given to each of them. When
they that were called early in the morninge perceived this, because they came
long before into the vineyarde, they thought that after the ra^e of the time,
they should receive greater wages. But a denary was given unto each of the^.
Therefore when they saw that they which were not like in space of time, yet
were made like in wages, they depart murmuring against the lord of the
vineyarde, and say. These which came at eleven of the clock have labored
but one hour, and yet thou makeste them like unto us in wages, who have
continued the whole day in labor, and have suffered the heat of the day
whereas they came a little before night, when the heat was now paste. But the
householder made answer to one of them for all: Friend, why have thou envy
that I am liberal unto others? My fre liberalytie toward other, hurts not
the. For I do the no wrong. Did I not bargayne with the, so that thou
shouldeste have a denarye for thy days labor? Thou haste done thy labor,
thou haste thy couenaunte: I have nothing more to do with the. Take that that
is owed unto the, and depart. Thou werte hiered hither for wages to do thy
labor, not to appoynte me what I shall do. Thus it is thought good unto me,
to give him that came last as much wages as I give the. Thou do lose none
of thine, if I give this man any thing of my liberality: Shall I not be at
liberty because of the, to do with my own what I will? Is thy iye therefore
vexed with envy, because thou see me liberal toward whom it pleases me? This
similitude Jesus brought, willing depely to graffe in their minds that God,
naturally beneficial toward al men, ceasseth not by diverse ways and in
diverse ages, to provoke and move al men to the service of true godliness: In
which they that have exercised themselves diligently, shall have for reward
everlasting life, from the which none is excluded giving ear when he is
called. This reward like as it is in no case due unto our merits but is of ye
goodness of god, yet it cummeth not without our endeavor: yet we be bound to the
ca^ler for this also, that we cum to the service of godlynes, and that we
continue in it unto the euentide of the day. For they that be called and refuse
to go into the vineyarde, they disapoynte themselves of their wages. And
although among sayne^es there is neither envy nor murmuryng against god: yet
with these saynges he expressed the high honor that was showed to the last,
which had the first place in reward. Which dignity in so noble, that a man
might have cause to envy. Yet the good Jews also at the beginning murmured
against the Gentiles, because they cumming of idolaters, strangers from Moses
law, finally uncircumcised, should suddenly be made equal unto them in the
grace of the gospel, and be admitted to the same salvation, being encumbered
with no burden of the law, whereas they long exercised in the ordinances of
Moses, were nothing better than Gentiles, which were now admitted to the
profession of the gospel, being a little before of a wicked life. Therefore the
Gentiles had more forgeuen them, but the Jews have no cause to brawle with God
therefore, sith they also may attain to like felicity. And if they had
rather envy than follow, let them thank themselves that they be cast of for
their unbelief, the Gentiles in the mean time obteining for the redines of
their faith, that thing which the Jews thought that they only ought to have.
For many are called but few are chosen.
Therefore whosoever is called, let him furthwith make haste, or else he shall be
called in vain, except he take heed that he be also elected. And all be
called, but few deserve to be counted among the elect. Therefore Jesus ended
his parable with the same clause that he began with* So shall they be last that
were first, and first that were last. For many be called, and few chosen.

to the chief of the pristes, and to the Scribes, and they shall condemn him
to death, and shall deliver him to the gentiles to be mocked and scourged, and
crucified, and the third day he shall rise again. After this Jesus being a
while in Galile, began to draw nere to the place of his death, going toward
Jerusalem. And now when he had instructed and framed his disciples many ways,
as concerning despysing of riches, neglecting of parents and kinsfolks, of
chastity, of great modesty, of the rewards that they should have also in
this life: he leads secretly aparte his twelve apostles, whom he had chosen
and thought mete to commit the mystery of the cross unto, which the
multitude was not yet able to bear: And yet he told of his death unto the
people, when he spoke of Jonas, and of the pulling down of the temple, and the
making up of it again in three days: but so he told them of it that they
understood not what was said, before that they saw it done. He had opened the
mystery of the cross unto his disciples, as to them that were more strong and
able, now once or twyse speaking unto them plainly. But because men forget
lightly that, which they be not glad to hear of, and do not lightly let
sink into their hearts the thing which the mind abhorrethe: the Lord Jesus
to confyrme his apostles against the storm that was at hand, openethe unto
them more plainly and distinctly, not only that his death was nere, but also
tells them of the mockes and affliccions which oftentimes be more greuouse
than death itself. Behold (quod he) we go to Jerusalem, and the son of
man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and Scribes, Behold we do go up.
etc.
which now go about to lay in wait for him. And they will not rest to
blame and accuse him until they have brought him to condemnacion of death,
and they shall deliver him unto the Gentiles to mock him, to scourge him, to
spit upon him, and to nail him upon the cross, and when that he is dead and
buried, the third day he shall rise again.

In the mean season James and John the sons of zebede, because they had
heard that the keys of the kingdom of heaven were given to Peter, and had
heard also of the honor of twelve seats, being yet rude and dreaming of
worldely things, and supposinge that this kingdom and these honors should
cum immediately after the resurreccion, because he said, the third day he
shall rise: to get themselves now some excellent dignity, they sent furthe
their mother to be a suitor unto Jesus for her sons. She after that she had
done her duty and worshipped him, requiring him not to deny her suite, being
required what she would, says: Give commandment that these my two sons
may sit in thy kingdom, one on thy right hand, the other on thy left hand.
Jesus turning unto the children, of whom he knew that the mother was sent
forth, answered them: ye know not what ye ask. Ye delight in the speaking of
a kingdom, which is far of an other sort than ye dream, but at this present
we must rather talk and debate of affliccion, and of the cross, which is the
way to the kingdom. Ye require the reward out of order, whereas first ye
must traueile and strive. I have opened unto you now what I must suffer. Can
ye drink of the cup that I shall drink of: Can ye be baptized with the
baptism that I shall be baptized with? They as yet little knowing their
strength, but for the gredines that they had to obtain their peticion, they
answer rashely rather than valiantly, we can. But Jesus was content that they
said they were ready to follow his cross, but as touching the reward, because
they understood not what they asked, and because it was not for that time to
commo^ne of it, he says that it is not in him to give them: but that such
dignity should not chance but unto them, unto whom it was given of the
father, for to deserve the chief place through notable and excellent virtue.
Truly to encourage al men to clime unto the highest, he says: ye shall
drink of my cup, but to fit one on my right hand, and the other on my left
hand, it is not in me to give, unto the one or to the other, but this shall
chance unto them to whom it shall be given of my father. Every man as he does
traueill, so he shall be rewarded.

When the other ten afterward heard these things, they were agreued (...) the
two brethren, because they ^eqai^ed so great dignity. They had not yet
received the holy ghost: they were led yet with certain affeccions of men
being ambiciouse and envying one an other. And Jesus suffered his disciples to
be troubled long with these affeccions, to the intent he would pluck them
utterly out of the minds of them all, which should succeed in the roumes of
thapostles. And they thought, and were glad, that therefore the lord did reject
the request of John and James, not because they dreamed of carnal things,
where as the spiritual kingdom was in hand, but because they required
honor above their merits, which other thought that it ought rather to be
given to them. Therefore Jesus like as he did repress the ambicion of the
folish sutours, because they knew not what it was that they asked: so he
repressed the envy and indignacion of the other, which issewed out of the same
fountain of ambicion, opening unto them that there was a far diverse kind of
the worldely kingdom from the kingdom of the gospel. For there in the
worldly kingdom he that is less, is oppressed with the tyranny of the
mightier. Here, the primacie is nothing else, but the great desire to do good
unto all men. There the prouder a man is, the greater he semethe: here (...) is
more meke in heart, Ye know yt the princes. etc.
than he that deseruethe chiefly to be the higheste. Tha^ he might fasten this
doctrine in all men's hearts, he called unto him the other of thapostles. Ye
know (quod he) that they that ^eare rule among the Gentyles, use lordlynes
and tyranny upon them, whom they rule: and they that be chief, exercise
their power upon their subjects. For with the hurt of the people, they provide
for their own authority, and care for those things, which do not profit
the multitude, but make for the stoutnes and flourishing of their wealth and
glory. But it is not mete to be so emonge you, but whosoever will bear rule
among you, let him be the minister of all men, not using honor for his own
commodity, but for the commodity of the people, whom he rules. And he that
among you will have the first place, let him be the servant and the lowest of
all. For he takes upon him the chief place for no another intent, but to look
for the commodity of al men, hunting and seking thereof neither honor nor
profit. And if ye think it hard, look upon me, for whereas I am your Lord and
Master and the son of God, as ye t^ulye profess, yet I take not upon me
dignity and honor, nor I abuse not my power to mine own commodity. But for
this I am cum, to serve al men's turns, and to wait their commodities,
insomuche that it g^eueth me not to bestow my life, And to give his life a
redemption for many.
that by the loss of one life, I may redeem many. Emonge them therefore that
be thus minded, there is no cause why any man should seek after honor,
neither why any should be enuiouse at an other man's dignity: for who can
envy him which studieth no another thing, but to do an other man good, and
that if need be with the loss of his life? Also if honor be given unto them,
they take it not unto themselves, but yield it unto God.

And when he went with his disciples out of Ierico, a great multitude of men
followed him. And behold two blind men sat by the ways side, which when they
perceived by the noise, that it was a great multitude, and asking what it
should be, knew that it was Jesus which passed by: when they could not see
him, and if they had seen him, could not go unto him for the multitude, they
spoke unto Jesus with a loud voice, saying: Lord Jesus the son of David, have
mercy upon us. Jesus made as though he heard them not, to thintente that their
faith and feruentnes might be the more manifest to all men. The people seeing
that Jesus made no answer at their crying, and suppossing that it was
paynefull to him, that twoe blind common beggars made such a clamoure at his
ears, rebuked them, and bad them hold their peace. But they through a
constante trust in Jesus, whom they heard say to be beneficial toward all
men, cried out louder, and said aga^ne: Lord the son of David, have mercy
upon us. Jesus therefore when he had sufficiently declared their faith to them
all, and had taught us by their example that we should beat at the ears of
God fervently and constantly, if we will obtain any thing: stood still (for
they could not follow but only with crying) and commanded the^ to cum to him.
At his word they cum. Jesus askethe them what they would with their great
crying, and what they would that he should do for them. Jesus was not
ignoraunte what they desired, but he would that the disease that they were
troubled with, should be known to all men by their own confession, that the
faith of the miracle might be the more certain. Lord (quod they) we desire
that our iyes may be opened by your help. They speaking these things with a
great affeccion, declare that blyndnes was a great grief unto them. And he is
next unto light, which is very weary of his blindenes. Than Jesus showing his
pietifull affeccion both in countenance and iyes, with which affeccion every
gospeller ought to be sorry for other men's harms, touched their iyes: and
forthwith their iyes being opened, they saw, and with others they followed
Jesus. So Jesus with his touching heals the mind blinded with worldly
desires, and light is given to this end, that we may follow his steps.

The.xxi. Chapter.

Therefore Jesus going forward to Jerusalem, labored about this diligently,
with his disciples, to fasten in their minds, that he went to his death
wittingly and willyngly, and that no man should hurt him, if he would
resist. Therefore he beat it into them so often, that he must go to Jerusalem
and there suffer death. And whereas sumtyme he seemed to wythdrawe himself from
peril, it was not for fear, but to keep himself unto the time appointed of
the father. The which when it was than at hand, he did not only not hyde
himself, but willyngly put furthe himself, and so put forth himself, that
with the novelty of his pomp, he styrred the minds of the whole city
against him: and in the mean season he cease not from miracles: he cease
not from preaching of the truth, also he reproves the life of the Phariseis
more freely or frankely: he casts the merchants out of the temple, by the
which things he knew that all their minds would be the more vehemently
styrred against him. Whom because he had provoked against him with well doing,
he made them not vnfaultie, but gave them liberty that they might do the thing
that they would do. Therefore now being nere to the city of Jerusalem, he came
into the mount of Olives, where he thought good to frame a new manner of pomp
of his cumming, by the which in manner he mocked the pride of this world, and
by this spectacle he somewhat comforted his disciples, being yet but weak,
that they might the more quietly bear the death of their Lord.

Therefore from this hill he sent two of his disciples, saying: go ye into the
village that is over against you, and as soon as ye enter in there, ye shall
find a female Ass tied, and her fool with her, whereon never has any manne
yet sitten, looce them both, and bring them hither unto me.

And if any manne say any thing unto you, demaundyng why ye looce them,
whither or to whom ye lead them, make none other answer, but that the Lord
has need of them. All this was done. etc.
At this word they will suffer them furthwith to be brought. These things
were done, partlye because they should understand that nothing is to him
unknown, and that he has power to command whom he will, and what he will,
if he would use his power: partly that the Jews might know, at lest wise by
this very token, that he was Messiah, because they saw this strange kind of
entering prophesied in time paste by the Prophet Zachary. For thus he did
prophecy: Say ye daughters of Syon: behold thy king cummeth to thee, meke
and humble, sitting upon a she ass, and upon a colte the fool of a yoked
beast.

The disciples departed, they found true whatsoever Jesus had told them
before. By and by at the mention of the lord, the beasts were let looce, where
as neither the Lord was there present, nor the disciples made any
countenance of any authority that they had. In deed the owners of the beasts
knew no such thing: but yet in their hertes they perceived that he which was
lord over all, commanded this. The disciples because the Lord should sit the
more at ease, cast on their clokes, and so set him upon the coltes back,
which colte did bear the figure of the Heathen nation being unclean, and
filthy following all ill desires: which when it was once covered with virtues
apostolical, and Jesus received upon her back, ceased any longer to be
unclean: ceased to follow her old vices, being made the bearer of him who
purges and sanctifies all things. This she ass is the dame of the fool,
(because health and redemption cummeth out of the Jews) but the same ass
was fast tied to the lett^e of the law: Bare she was of evangelical virtues:
but at the lords biddyng they are both untied, and covered with the Apostles
clothes. The Apostles as yet understood not these things, but yet this it was
which was signified there^^, and should more plainly be understood
afterward. When Jesus was now come to the foot of the hill, a great multitude
of men came out of Jerusalem to mete him. Yea and the multitude had such a
favor unto him, that the most part of them strawed the way with their
garments, some cut down boughs from the trees, and strawed them in the way.
Ferther the company that went before, and also that followed, declaryng
themselves to be glad of his cumming, sang unto him this saying out of the
prophecy of the psalm. Osanna to the son of David, blessed be he that
cummeth in the name of the lord. Osanna to the son. etc
Osanna on high. Others cried: blessed be the kingdom of our father David, the
which is come. Others cried. Blessed be the king of Israel which is come:
and they praised God for the miracles which they saw done by Jesus.

This honor the Lord Jesus, who had ever to fore lived humble and low,
suffered to be given unto him, whereby he declared that he should not be
without the glory of this world, in case he were minded to have it: but that
he had rather to despise it, than to embrace it, to the end it might be so
much the more shame that it should be sought for of such as profess
themselves to be his disciples, where as he despised it which only deserved
it. Yet this honor was mere and semely for the cummynge of him, who by his
death should redeem the whole world.

Therefore when Jesus entered into Jerusalem with this strange and vnwoonte
pomp, the whole city was moved with this uncouth sight, saying: What man is
this? The multitude which followed him, answered: This is Jesus the Prophet
of Nazareth, the city in Galile. This they thought a goodly praise, although
that it was far under his majesty. For the people as yet could suppose
nothing of him above man. And Christ did purposely so order his life, that he
uttered not openly his godly nature, which he should have persuaded in
vain, if they had seen him afterward suffer death. Therefore with this
rufflyng, Jesus entered into the temple and there furthwith began to use a
certain kingdom. When he saw in the temple a fashion of a market, sum
selling, sum biyng, and the changers of money sitting, Jesus moved with the
vngoodlines of the thing, according to the saying of the Prophet: The zeal
of thy house has eaten me, he made a whip of little coardes, and drove all the
buyers and sellers with their merchandise out of the temple, he cast down the
tables of the money changers and scatered their money upon the ground: he cast
down the seats of the dove sellers, alleging forth of Esaias a just cause of
his grief, who says in the person of God: My house shall be called the house
of prayer, My house is the house of prayer.
but ye have made it a den of thieves. By this act Jesus mente an other thing.
For that the temple was polluted with marchandyse of bullockes, sheep, goats
and doves, did not so greatly move him, but it was his mind to show that
auaryce and lucre would be a deadly poison unto his church in time to cum,
which was figured by that temple, whose religion should shortly after be
abolished. For at such time is the temple which is consecrate to offer up to
God spiritual sacrifice, turned into a den of thieves, when under the
pretense of religion and priesthode, the people is robbed. For nothing can be
sincere and holy, where the love of money doethe reign. And this mischief is
than a thing intolerable, when it is used under the roof of the temple, when
rauine is covered with the shadow of religion. There was no sort of men,
against whom Jesus at any time showed any more rigor, then he did toward
these, and yet has he reserved the same unto himself to be cast out, Also the
blind and the lame. etc
when himself shall think best. Then unto Jesus being in the temple, there
came the blind and lame, whom the law barred from entryng into the temple.
But the temple of Jesus receives all which make speed unto health. For the
blind came, that having their sight they might see Jesus, whom they heard
so spoken of. The lame came, that following his steps, they might come into
the kingdom of heaven. As many therefore as came to him, he healed them.

When the thief priests and Scribes saw the wonders that he did, and the
children crying in the temple* and saying: Hosanna to the son of David* they
dis^ayned, and said unto him: hear thou what these say? But Jesus says
unto them: Why not? Have ye never red? Out of the mouth of infantes and
sucklinges thou haste ordained praise? And he left them, and went out of the
city unto Bethallia, and abode there. The chief Priests and the Scribes
thorough those things whereby they ought at last to repent, were the more
kyndled with burning in envy, when they saw the people rejoicing so lovingly
on every side, and saw the great power in healing of the lame and blind, and
authority in casting out of merchandise, no man being so bold to resist,
and the children also crying in the temple, Os Anna to the son of David. They
taking these things grievously, monished Jesus to cease that crying, else it
would cum to pass that he should seem to acknowleage such honor, of which
they judged him unworthy, where as it should have been their parts rather more
gre^ely to praise him, and to speak well of him, which being ancient men and
skillful in the law and the prophecies, seeing so many miracles, might
understand that this is Messiah whom they looked for so long time. Now the
children by the instigacion of nature, or rather by the inspiracion of God,
spoke that thing, which they could not understand for lack of age. Therefore
they blinded with envy, and drunken with anger, said unto him: hear thou
what these children say? But Jesus stopping their mouth with a testimonye of
scripture, did ye never read (quod he) of the mauthe of infantes and
sucklinges thou haste made perfect thy praise? will ye therefore that I should
shut their mouth, which God has opened to praise his glory? I say unto you:
God will not suffer his praise to he had in silence through your envy, in so
much that if these hold their peace the stones will cry, whose hardenes ye
excede. Therefore Jesus leuyng them with their envy, departed, and going out of
the city of Jerusalem, went unto Bethania, and there tarryed.

In the morning by the way as he returned unto the city, he began to wexe
hungry. And when he saw a figtree nere the way, he came toward it, as hoping
to have sum food. And when he come at it, he found nothing on it but leaves.
Therefore as being grieved that he was deceived of his hope, he cursed it,
saying: Never man see fruit of the hereafter. And when the disciples returned
again the same way, seeing the figgetree which Jesus cursed, than to he
withered, and the leaves fallen of, marvelled and said unto him: behold the
figgetree which thou did curse, is now withered. Jesus suffered this to be
done for this purpose, that he might inculcate diligently faith unto his
disciples, without the which he knew that his death should be unprofitable
to men. For he thyrsted maruelouslye after the health and salvation of
mankind, and now desired and longed for his death. But whereas he found an
apperau^ce of religion in the Jews, he found not the fruit of faith, which
only he hungered for. Unto his disciples therefore marueiling at the fig tree
so suddenly withered, he made answer on this wise: why maruayle ye at this
which is no great matter, a fig tree to wyther? the might of faith can do
more, which if ye possess both strong and constante, ye shall not only
do, which ye saw chance unto the fig tree, but also if ye say to this
hill, remove the from thy place, and go into the sea, your commandment
shall be done forthwith. And whatsoever ye shall ask in your prayers, so that
ye have a sure trust, ye shall obtain.

And when he entered into the temple and taught the people, the chief priests
and certain of the Seniours of the people, not suffering him to be there in
his kingdom freely, go unto him and say. By what authority do thou these
things? And who gave the this authority? For since no man gave him this
authority, either he must say that it was given him of God, or else of
Beelzebub. If he had said of God, he should have said truth, but he should
have done nothing but provoked them. For they ask not that they will believe,
which might appear by the thing it self, but falsely to reprove and blame.
Jesus therefore not ignorant of this thing, requi^ed their question with an
other, as though a man should drive out one nail with an other. I will ask
you (quod he) a certain thing, and if ye answer me to that, I will answer to
your question. The authority whereby John did baptize, from whence came it
unto him? from heaven or from men? They took deliberacion with themselfes, what
they should answer. For they saw it was a question with two pikes, and that
they must needs fall upon the one. They thought in their minds, if we say from
heaven, he will forthwith say unto us: why than did ye not believe him? for he
preached the kingdom of God, and witnessed with me. But if we say, of men, it
is to be feared lest the people will make a sedicion, because all men took
John for a Prophet. Therefore lest they should be reproved they made answer
that they could not tell. Than spoke Jesus: And I will not tell you (quod he)
from whence I have this authority.

But because a simple and plain question could not wring out the confession
of truth, Jesus puts forth an other question by a riddell, that unawares they
shall give sentence against themselves: what think ye (quod he) of that I will
propose now? A certain man had two sons. He came to the one and said:
Son, go and work this day in my vineyard. He answered frowardly, I will not.
But strayt afterward repenting himself, he went into the vineyarde. The father
likewise came to the other son and said: go, and labor in my vineyarde this
day. He answers redily, lo I go sir, and yet he went not. Therefore of
these two, whether think ye fulfilled his fathers will* They not understanding
to what end these went, answered: The first son, which repenting
forthwith, went into the vi^eyarde. Than Jesus turning the parable upon them,
said: certaynlye I tell you truethe, that the publicanes and ^ommon women
shall go before you in the kingdom of heaven. They being rebels against God
before with their wicked life, yet by and by touched and moved by penance
obeyed the doctrine of the gospel. Ye which be the people of God by title and
profession, and ye which said in times paste, and this day say, we will do
all things whatsoever the Lord says unto us, which also have ever in your
mouth the precepts of God, and the Lords temple, the Lords temple, the
Lords temple, being so many ways provoked, cannot be moved to penance. For
John came showing you the way of ryghteousnes, and that the wrath of God was
at hand, and the axe set at the tree roots, unless furthwith ye would
repent. Ye saw the Publicanes and common women (desperate folks after your
judgment,) obedient unto him. Ye could not be moved unto penance neither by
the great holiness of John, neither by his holsom doctrine, neither by his
threteninges, neither by the example of the publicanes and common women. So it
cummethe to pass, that they through faith, take from you the kingdom of
God: ye vaynelye professing God with your mouth, be shut out for the unbelief
of your mind.

He put them another parable even as dark, where with he does recite
se^^^^ely, and leyeth before their iyes, their notable unkindness, which
being provoked by so many benefits of God, did not only not amend, but
also ^ruelly killed the Prophets one after another, which were sent, that at
their preaching they might once repent. And not content herewith, finallye
they would kill the son of God himself, and that after that he was cast out
of the vineyarde, showing as it were by the way the place where he should be
crucified. By the which communicacion he declares both yt their invincible
malice is unworthy pardon (seeing that nothing was omitted that might call
them back to a better mind) and that he should suffer nothing of them,
which he knew not of before. This was the parable. There was (quod he) a
certain householder, which planted a vineyarde, and hedged it about and
dug in it a cesterne, to receive the sweet wine that was pressed out of the
clusters of grapes, and buylt in it a lodge for the keeping of the vineyarde,
and so when it was well garnished, he set it out to husband men: that they
should trustely till it, and tender the fruits unto the lord. This done, he
went far of. Now when the time of gatheryng the fruit approached nere, he
sent his servants to receive the fruit of them. But the husband men did
not only not deliver the fruits that were due, but also laid hands upon
his servants, and bette sum, killed sum, and stoned sum to death. This known
the householder did not forth with punish them, but loking that they should
repent and amend, sent unto them a greater number of servants than he did
before: trusting that they being kept under and in awe with the multitude,
they would do their duty. But they handeled them also no more gentely, than
they handeled the other before. The householder suffered this displeasure also,
and finally to ouercum them with softnes and gentilnesse, he sent unto them his
own son, saying with himself: although they have been cruel toward my
servants, yet at the least they will use my son reverently, when they see
that he is cum. But the husband men the more they were provoked to
repentance, the more they were styrred unto cruelties. For when they saw the
son, they did not reverence him, insomuche that furthwyth they consulted to
slay him, saying: this is the heir, cum let us kill him, and we shall take his
inheritance. And by and by they laid hands upon him, and plucked him out of
the vineyarde and killed him. Therefore (quod he) when the Lord of the
vineyarde shall cum, what shall he do to those husband men? The Phariseis
answered: those ill men he shall ill entreat and destroy, and set out his
vineyarde to others, which may trustely render the fruit in time unto the
Lord whithe let it out. So they deceived by this ryddle, condemn them
selves with their own mouth: pronouncing, that they themselves for the
invincible frowardenes of their mind be wurthy punishmente, and that the
gentiles be wurthy to be received to the grace of the ghospel, which will till
the vineyarde more trusttely than they did.

After these things, Jesus showed that through their frowardenes he being
condemned and rejected, should dye a spiteful death, but by his resurreccion
through the power of the father, he should be made notable thoroughout all the
world and should be so sound and strong, that whosoever stumbled against him,
should be his own destruction. And that in declaryng of this he might less
offend them, he bryngethe a prophecy out of the psalm. Never (...) ye in the
scriptures (quod he) the stone which the builders did refuse and cast away,
the same is made the head of the corner? This is done of the lord and it is
wonderful in our iyes: signifying that they builded the Synagoge, but casti^g
out Christ, without whom no building was sure: but yet ye stone rejected of
the^, should be in great estimacion and price in the church of ye Gentiles. And
therefore Jesus did add: therefore I say unto you, the kingdom of god shall be
taken from you, which ye despise being offered unto you, and it shall be given
to other people, which shall bring forth fruits meet for the gospel. And as
this stone shall bring health to them that obey the gospel, so it shall bring
destruction unto them that be disobediente through unbelief. For whosoever
stumbleth at this stone, shall be broken. Again upon who^ this stone falls, he
shall be bruised.

At length, of the conclusion of this communicacion, first the chief
priests and Scribes understood that he spoke the former parables also against
the^, in the which they being deceived, gave sentence against themselves. And
therefore their madness was so set a fire, that they would forth with have laid
hands upon him: But they feared the people, because Jesus was made much of,
of many, and taken for a Prophet.

The.xxii. Chapter.

Again Jesus added an other parable, to print the more surely in ye minds of
the Jews, yt it came to pass by their own obstinate malice, yt they were
rejected from salvation of the gospel, and yt the Gentiles shall take and
enjoy, that that they made them selves unworthy of. There is none excluded
from the ki^gdom of God, but this honor was given to the nacio^ of Jews,
that they were called first of all, and gently called, not unto sower or vile
things, but unto a marriage, yt is to honor, delicates, and liberty of ye
gospel. And they were not invited only by the prophet John, and by Christ
himself, but also after his death, they should be called by the Apostles: and
the preachers of the gospel should not go to the gentyles before that for
their diligence and well doing, they had been arrayed long of the Jews with
many mockes, and punishments: that they can ascribe it to no man, that
afterward they shall be punished with so many miseries, which despised Gods
goodness, so often offered unto the^. This is the similitude. The kingdom of
heaven (quod he) is through you made like to a certain king, who making a
bridale to his son, sent out his servant, to inu^^e and call many to his
sons marriage. But they once called, would not cumme. Then the king sent mo
servants to bid them more diligently to make haste unto the weddyng now in a
redines, and to say to them in his name: Behold the diner is ready, my oxen
and my pultrie be killed, and al other things be in a readiness. Now nothing
lacks but cumming of the geastes, that the preparacion be not made in vain.
But they again neglected the bidder. And when the bidders called upon them,
every man made his excuse: one said, he must gose e his manor or farm place,
that he had lately bought: another said, he must go look upon his oxen, which
he had bought: Another said, he had late married a wife, from whom he could
not depart. And these men were only mad to themselves which preferred
certain vile and fylthy cares of frail things, before a feast of such
felicity. But other joined cruelnes unto their unkindness. For the kings
servants, which did once or twyse inuit them unto so great honor, they
handeled and used very sore with many rebukes, and at length killed them also.
And when the king, and
The which doing when the king heard of, he took it very grievously: and
turnyng his gentilnes, which they had so despised, into a rage, and sendyng
forth men of his guard destroyed these murderers: and not content with that,
set their city a fire also. These things spoke Jesus prophesying unto them
covertly the destruction of the city of Jerusalem: and by and by he gives
intelligence that the gentiles shallbe called on every side unto the gospel,
as those wiche were better than the Jews.

Than he said unto his servants, the bridale is ready: but because they that
were called, declared themselves for to be unworthy for this feast, which not
withstandyng I prepared chiefly for them: run abroad every where in streets
and cross ways, and call to the bridale indifferently, whomsoever ye find,
worthy, unworthy, febie, maimed, blind, and lame, till my house be full. The
servants went forth and brought together a multitude of all sorts gathered
together from all places, and the feast was replenished with geastes. After
this, Jesus because he had showed before, that the Jews should be grievously
punished, which afflicted the apostles, calling them so often, and at length
killed them, declares also that they shall be sore punished which once
professing the life of the gospel, return again to the filthiness of their
old life. The king (quod he) went in to see the geastes sittyng at the table,
and among others he saw one there, which had not on his weddinge garment.
Friend (quod he) how came thou in hither, since thou have not thy wedding
garmente? But he being put to shame was dumme, and had nothing to say. Than the
king commanded his servants that they should bind him hands and feet,
remove him far from the feast, and cast him into great darkness, where is
weeping and gnashing of teeth, the honor and the light of the feast being
changed into a vile prison, and great pleasure being changed into great
tor^ment. Further though many be called, yet few be chosen al be called freely,
bu^ none be chosen but they that obey their calling, and they that unto the
^ude answer unto the goodness of God toward them, continuyng in the study and
love of the evangelical godlynes.

Than went the Phariseis and took counsel how they might tangle him in his
words. The (...)
And they sent forth to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying:
Master, we know that thou art true, and teach the way of God truly,
neither regarded thou any man, nor thou haste respect of persons. Tell us
therefore, how thy likest thou? Is it lawful that tribute be given to Ceasar,
or not? And Jesus perceiving their malice, said: why tempt ye me, ye
Hipocrites? Show me the tribute money: and they took him a denarie, and he
said unto them: whose image is this, and superscripcion? They said unto him:
Ceasars* Than said he unto them Give therefore unto Ceasar, the things which
are Ceasars, and unto God those things that are gods. When they had heard
these words, they meruayled, and left him, and went away. When the Jews
perceived that they were touched with these parables, they were not yet moved
unto penance, insomuche that now they mused in their minds nothing else but
how that Jesus might be killed. So great a mischief is envy and ambicion.
They had a will to murdre, but they lacked opportunity. They feared not God,
the revenger of such mischifes, but they feared the people. They thought
therefore to go a contrary way, and to do the thing with such secret
undermining, that the envy of the deed should redound and rest upon Ceasar and
his officers. And they sent furthe to him. etc.
Therefore for the time, they dissembled their anger and went away. But
consulting among themselves, it was thought good, that certain should be
subornated and setforth to propose a question unto Jesus, and to take him in
his answer, and to bring him into the princes danger, that by them, as being
guilty of treason, and the author of sedicion, he might be put to death, the
Phariseis having nothing to do with the matter. And their inuencion was this.
When Iewry began now to be tributarie to the Romans, king Herod the son of
Antipater was made officer of August to gather the tribute: And of this thing
every man had not like opinion: for some thought it not meet that the people
dedicate unto God, should pay tribute to princes that were Idolatours. And in
this opinion were they which held with the Phariseis. Again there were sum
the favorers of Ceasar, which said that tribute ought to be paid: and the
mainteners of this opinion were called Herodians, because Herod was the
officer to gather the tribute. A little before there were two, Theudas and
Judas, which whilst they did defend openly that the Jews, a people dedicate
unto god, ought no tribute to any profane prince, were put to death like
sediciouse persons. Now the Phariseis trusted that Christ favoring religion
more than Ceasar, being profane and wicked, would pronounce and judge
according to his accustomed liberty against ye Herodians, that tribute should
not be paid to Ceasar: and furthwith by them should be accused unto Herod,
and should be punished like as The^das and Judas were before. And if he had
pronounced that tribute should be paid, than they would have laid to his
charge that he had flattered wicked princes, and not favored gods religion.
Therefore they do subornate, and send forth certain of their disciples,
which, the Herodians being present with a great number of men, that the thing
should not lack witnesses, colourably with fair speaking should entise him
into their net. So great was their blyndnes, that the thing so often attempted
in vain, they would not rest. Neither be they ashamed of their inconstancye,
now calling him master, where before they laid to his charge that he was
possessed with the spirit of Beelzebub. And they commend his liberty, that
he should not fear to offend the Herodians. Master (quod they) we know that
thou art true, thou flatterest no man, thou lie nothing: But thou do
teach with great liberty the pleasure of god, not the phantasye of men. For
thou fear no mortal man, and regardest no person. Tell us therefore what ye
think: Is it leefull for the people of Jews which is dedicate to the
religion of God, to pay tribute unto Ceasar, or no? And shall we give it
hereafter, or no? But Jesus to show that their craftye flatteryng could not
deceive him, so ordered his answer with wonderful wisdom, that he
endaungered himself to neither of the faccions: but monished them what did
most appertain unto their salvation: that is, to pay unto God the high
Prince, Is it lawful that tribute? etc.
the tribute of godlynes. Ye Hypocrites (quod he) why do ye tempte me? Show me
a coin of the tribute. For they went about to catch Jesus in his words. He
again catches them in their answers. Therefore they showed him a Dena^ie,
which had the Image and name of Ceasar. And to declare that he came not for
this purpose to make laws of these things, which pertayne nothing unto
Godlynes, and the which for the time may be well or ill done, when he saw
the coin, as though he knew no such letters nor Images, who went only about
heavenly things: he asked whose title and Image it was. Answer was made:
Ceasars. Than said Jesus: Render therefore unto Ceasar, if any thing appertain
unto Ceasar, but first of all render unto God, And unto God. etc.
the things that appertain unto God: meaning that it is no hurt to godliness,
if a man being dedicate to God, do give tribute to a profane prince,
although he owe it not, desiring rather to be obedient, than to provoke and
stir him: chiefly in that thing which makes a man poorer, but not ungodly.
Otherwise if he does exact that which makes us ungodly, it is not now the
tribute of Ceasar, but of the devil.

When they had this answer they marueyled: First because they perceived that
their suttell devise was not hid from him: Furthermore for his wonderful
wisdom, whom man's craftines went about to deceive in bayne. They maruailed
truly, but they were not changed. And forsaking him, they left of to provoke
him, sith they could not overcome him: but they did not leave of to hate him,
whom they ought to love.

Therefore when the Phariseis and the Herodians were departed, the Sadduceis
came unto him. That faccion among the Jews, is more gross and less learned,
disagreing from the Phariseis in this, that they deny the resurreccion: In
somuche that they believe not the Angels to be, nor the souls to be, after
they be separate from the body, thynkyng nothing to be but that which they
see. They when they heard Christ make often mention of everlasting life, and
of the world to come, and of the resurrection of the just, they come unto him
to try whether he agreed with the Phariseis, or taught contrary to them, that
they might reprove him if he were against them, orels laugh him to skorne, if
he agreed with the Phariseis. Therefore they do object unto him this hard
question. There were with ^s seven brethren.
Master (quod they) Moses made this law: If a man having married a wife,
depart without children, that the brother of the dead should marry the widow
left of his brother, and couplyng with her should raise up issue to his
brother departed. There were among us seven brethren, of whom the first
married a wife, and departed without children. The next brother married her,
who also died without issue. Likewise it chanced to the third, and the
fowerth, unto the seventh, all dyed without issue. At last the wife dyed also,
which was married to seven brethren. Therefore in the resurreccion, which of
all them shall have her to his wife* For she cannot be a common wife for them
all, and all married her indifferently. To this question because it was more of
ignorance than of malice, Jesus did vouchsafe to make answer. For he that
erreth by ignorance is worthy to be taught. But they that propose questions
of mere malice, be not worthy to be answered. Ye err (quod he) which read
the sciptures, but ye understand them not: and imagining nothing above bodily
things which ye see, ye know not the power of god, who is more wonderful in
things, which be not seen. Here where men by courses be borne to dye, wedlock
is used for propagacion and bryngyng forth of mankind. But where now
mortality shall be swalowed up and consumed, and men shall be spiritual, which
thing shall come to pass in the resurreccion, the which shall restore us
again, being the same in deed that we were, but yet changed after another
sort, there shall no man marry, nor no woman shall be married. For there shall
need no generation where no death shall be. Further, they that pertayne to the
resurreccion of the just, live without matrimony like the angels of God in
heaven: recording now here and mynding to their power, that they shall come to
in the resurreccion. For they had rather get souls to God, than bodies to the
world.

After this, Jesus notyng secretly this so folishe a question to spring of a
false persuasion, for that they believed not the resurreccion: disdayned not to
wede this opinion also out of their minds, teaching them also that this is
taken out of the books of Moses, by whose authority they apposed Jesus. Why
have ye an ill opinion of the resurreccion of the dead as though Moses taught
it not openly, whose wrytinges ye read grossly, and nothing diligently? Have
ye not red in his books what god says? I am the god of Abraham, and the god of
Isaac, and the god of Jacob. If they had peryshed wholly by the death of the
bodies, he would not say that he is their god, but that he was their god. But
if he be their god, truly their souls do live, and they wholly do live in
manner by the hope of resurreccion that shall be, God is life, and he is not God
of the dead which now be not, but of the living. So he taught them
resurreccion to be, but not to be after such sort, as they imagined it to
be, when they proposed a folyshe question of seven brethren. The people when
they saw every man's mouth stopped with wise aunswers, they merueiled at his
effectual and ready doctrine.

The Phariseis were not displeased that the Sadduceis were put to silence,
chiefly in a matter wherein they were clean contrary one against another.
Therefore when the Phariseis saw them put to silence, and rebuked also for
ignorance of scripture, they taking heart of grace again, gather together,
and set forward a certain doctor of law, which should go unto Jesus with
a clerkly question, that either he might reprove him of ignorance, orels he
himself bear away the praise of learning. Master (quod he) which is the
chief commandment in the law? Jesus purposyng to show that they which
crake of the profession of the law, be furthest from keeping of the greatest
commandment in the law, which wholly flame with envy and hatred of their
neighbor, and with other vices which have none affinity with Christian
charity: and that no man loves God, which is unjust to his neighbor,
answered: Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and all thy mind: This is the chief and greatest commandment.
The which no man does perform and keep, unless he keep also the second
like unto that: For this: Thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, does
depend of the other. And whatsoever is commanded in the whole law,
whatsoever the Prophets teach, all that is comprysed in these two
commandments. For whosoever loves God with all his heart, will neglecte
nothing that he has commanded: And he that loves his neighbor as himself,
he will not steal, he will not commyt aduoutry, he will not bear false
witness, he will not desire his neighbors substance. Finally he will do
nothing to an other, which he would not to be done to himself. Than the
Pharisey which was become now almost of a tempter a disciple, In these twoe
commandments. etc.
said: Master, thou have spoken truly and rightly, that there is one God,
and no another but he and that he only ought to be loved above all things,
with all our power, and that we must bend all our affeccions toward him
only: and that to love our neighbor as our self, is more than all the
holocaustes and sacrifices. Jesus seeing that he had answered wyselye, and went
not forward to lie in wait, says unto him: thou art not far from the
kingdom of God. For he perceived what was best, he lacked only this, to
follow in affeccion and heart that that he understood. And in the mean time he
touched secretly the conscience of certain Phariseis, which laid deadly
wait for Jesus. And therefore whereas they demanded only of the chief
commandment, the keeping of the which they falsely took upon them: he
purposely added the second, concerning the love of their neighbor, for as
yet they supposed not that Christ was God, but to be their neighbor, and one
that had done much for them, they could not deny: against whom
notwithstanding they did devise that, that no man would should have come unto
himself.

But now whereas a greater company of Phariseis were gathered together, Jesus
being tempted of them with so many questions, proposed unto them again a
question, signifying unto them sumwhat obscurely and darkely that which he
left to be declared afterward by his Apostles in time convenient: that he had
not only the nature of man which they saw, and upon which they would show
their cruelty, but also that he had the nature of God, the which sum what they
might have co^iectured of ^is deeds, unless envy, hatred, ambicion, avarice and
other vices, had blinded their minds. Therefore he demau^deth of them being
gathered together, what they thought of Messiah, whose son he should be, that
is, of whose stock he should come. They answer furthwith: of David. Than said
Jesus: what means it that David in the mystical Psalm inspired with the
heavenly ghost, calls him Lord, whereas he is his son? For it is written:
The Lord said unto my Lord, sit on my ryghthande, until I make thine
enemies the stool of thy feet. How agrees it if he be the son of David,
that the father calls his son Lord? And there was not one of them that
could looce this knot, because that they could as yet think nothing of the
godly nature of Jesus. For Christ as he was the son of David, touching the
body of man: so touching the divine nature, he was Lord of all, and not of
David only. And after this no man durst question with him when they saw
that the baytes and snares which were laid for him, redounded upon their own
head.

The.xxiii. Chapter.

THerefore when Jesus had put them so often to silence, in the presence of the
multitude, lest their authority should utterly decay with the people, over
whom they were set to be doctors and teachers, he declared that they ought
to be heard, but not to be followed. For although it is most agreeable, that he
that takes upon him the office of a teacher, should get credit and authority
to his doctrine, by virtuous living: yet it is not expediente utterly to
despise the wholesome doctrine for the naughty life of the doctor. The
reverence which their manners do not deserve, must be given unto the author,
whose commandments they recite, and preach. For the law of god is not
polluted, though it be uttered by the mouth of a naughty preacher. Truly unto
him it is unprofitable, but it is profitable to the taker. Therefore Jesus
tournyng away from the Phariseis, in whom he saw no hope of better life, he
speaks unto the people, and the disciples on this manner. The Scribes and the
Phariseis utter themselves what corrupt minds they have, how enuiouse, how
couetouse, how gredy of vain glory they be. But yet for the authority of
their office they must be heard. They occupye the chair of Moses, whose law
they teach. The things that they teach are holy: for they reach the
doctrine of other and not their own, but their life is far and wide in
distaunce from their doctrine. Al therefore whatsoeeuer they hid you keep, keep
and do. etc.
Wherefore whatsoever they prescribe and point unto you by thautoritie of
Moses, keep it and do it: but beware that ye frame not your manners after their
life. If they lived as they teach, ye ought wholly to follow them. Now they do
not as they teach. They exact more than the law of other men with great
severity, and they pardon themselves. They be very rigorouse toward others,
and gentle to themselves. For they bind together hea^y and intolerable bundels
of commandments, and lay them upon other men's shoulders, which they will
not vouchesafe to touch with their finger. For they lode the law heavy enough
of it self, with their constitucio^s, to get them a fame of learning and
holiness. And if they perform any thing according to the commandment of the
law, they do it not with their heart, but for praise and fame of the people.
They be players, and as disgised persons they play their part, with a
counterfayte viser of religion, to be seen of men. But no man keeps the law
but he that does as the lawemaker would, he requires chiefly a pure and
sincere mind. But these men whatsoever they do, do it to hawk for a vain
opinion of holiness, with the simple people.

For when God (after that the commandments of the law were given) added:
Thou shall tie them in thy hand, and they shall not be removed from thine
iyes: meaning thereby, that we ought never to forgette the commandments of
God, but after their rule to frame all the doings of our life: these men
neglectyng utterly to keep the commandments of God, yet they magnify
themselves among the people with a false apperaunce. They walk up and down
bearyng about broad Philacteries, they go with broad and gorgiouse
imbroderinges, and show forth the commandments of the law written in them,
where as in their life they never appear. These should have been written in
their hearts, and expressed in their life. So they should please the iyes of
God, unto whom only our life should play her pageaunt. But this beholder and
loker on despised, they seek after vile praise of the rude multitude. And
whereas it becummeth a teacher every where to express noble virtue in his
manners and sayings, and also in his countenance, these men do nothing else but
that that is very vain, and also scant worthy and mete^ for manne. If they be
called any where to supper, there they place themselves chyldishly and
ambiciously, because the more honorable place is offered unto them: In
Synagoges and common councels, they love the honor of the high seat. When
they be in the market, And to be called of me^ Rabbi.
they rejoice to be saluted honorably. They set up their combs as often as
they hear of the people that honorable title, Rabbi: as who says, they only
be worthy of honor, or be only wise: where as for this they be least esteemed
with god, because they seem to themselves greatest: and in this they be most
folishe, because they seem to themselves most wise. Honor is due only to God,
who only is great in deed, and to be honored: The praise of wisdom is due
only to God, and authority is due only to God. If any of these things be in
men, it is but a certain shadow only, if it be compared to the greatness of
God, and it cummeth also from the bountefulnesse of God. Therefore if men yield
any honor unto men for the gifts of God, which they suppose to be in them,
he to whom it is given ought not to challenge it to himself, but to yield the
whole unto him from whom he has all, yea and that freely, if he has any
goodness. But I would not that ye my disciples should be like unto them: but
rather remembering my exaumple and doctrine, flee the arrogant name of wisdom,
nor please not your selves if any manne call you Rabbis, that is to say, our
masters. For there is one unto whom this name truly agrees, and this is your
common master. But you in comparison of him be nothing else but fellow scholars
and brethren together: among whom mutual charity makes all like. And it is
not cumly that any man prefer himself before another: but the contencion is
far contrary, that is to say, that one give honor to an other, and one with
gentleness and duty preuente an other. Therefore call no man master in earth,
seeing that whatsoever wholesome doctrine ye have, ye have it all of God, and be
bound to him for it. By him he teaches, whosoever teaches rightly. By his
inspiracion he profits, whosoever truly profits. Nor yield not heareafter
unto manne in earth, the honorable name of father, since ye have once professed
the heavenly father, unto whom ye be bound both for life, and for whatsoever
ye have, and upon whom ye do wholly depend. Let no man therefore challenge unto
him the honor due unto God only, let no man give that to man which is due to
God only. To whom only all praise, honor, and thanks, must be given. If any
man teach well, let the wisdom of God be praised in him, which does show
forth and communicate herself by him. If any man does the part of a father in
diligence and carefulnes, let the goodness of God be praised in him, which does
provide for you by him. But the lord Jesus spoke not these things as though
it were a wicked thing to call a master by the name of master, or call a
parent by the name of a parent: but by this communicacion he endeavors to
pluck out utterly from the minds of his, their pharisaicall ambicion, which
challenge unto them that, that was Gods, and requires honor of the people for
the doctrine, which was not theirs, but Gods: as though they were the authors,
and not rather ministers. Furthermore he noted the simplicity and flatterye of
the people, which praised them immoderately, as though they were more bound to
men than to God. Whosoever exalts himself. etc.
And because he perceived that there sprang of such ambicion, poison and
destruction of the congregacions, therefore he finisheth his communicacion with
this clause: he that is greatest among you, he shall be your minister. For what
he has, he has received it else where, and has received it freely: and has
received it for this, that he should give it to other. Therefore the greater he
is by the gifts of God, he shall not be the more arrogante, but the more
careful to bestow them, and the more lowly and humble: lest he should lose
at once by arroga^cy that, that gods liberality has given unto him. Let him
give all the glory unto God the author, chalengeyng nothing unto himself, but
the diligence of an humble minister. He is great in deed, which is least in
his own conceyte. And he begins now to be least with God, which is great in
his own conceyte. And if a man crake and auaunce himself of the free gifts
of God, being spoiled of them whereof he makes himself unworthy, of the
greatest, he is become the least. Contrariwise he that does submit and humble
himself, knowlegyng and setting forth his weakness, and knowlegyng the gifts
of God, whereby he is great, or else showing and uttering them to the profit and
commodity of his brethren: he because he provoke gods liberality through
his modesty, the gifts being increased, of great, he is made greater.

After these, Jesus turnyng to the Scribes and Phariseis, inueyeth, and
speaks against their malice openly, and very frankly, thretnyng them with the
vengeance of God: that either they might repent for shame, or else might turn
to better for fear of punishment: and the cou^terfeityng of holiness set
aparte, might begin to be the servants of the evangelical godlynes. Woe be
to you (quod he) ye Scribes and Phariseis, Hipocrites, who professyng the
knowledge of the law, and therefore in manner keep the keys of the kingdom of
heaven: ye do not only not enter your selves* but ye shut the doors against
them that would come in, unto whom ye ought to open the doors: and ye resist
them that be in a readiness of themself, whom if they were slack, ye ought to
prick forward. For whereas ye see that the light of the gospel is now
present, yet for your glory and for your advantage, ye keep the people in the
shadows of the law, excludyng them from the truth.

Woe be to you Scribes and Phariseis, Hipocrites, who under the color of
religion, devour wydowes houses, whom ye deceive with a false cloak of holiness.
For ye counterfeyte long prayer openly, whereas your minds in the mean time
look for naught else, but for a pray of the folyshe women, which still believe
that in the mean season ye talk with God.

Woe be to you Scribes and Phariseis, Hipocrites, because ye walk about the
lands, and seas, to entice sum one of the Gentiles to the profession of the
law, who, when he is brought in with hope to learn the law, is brought in
such case through your supersticiouse doctrine, and perverse manners, that he
is not only not made a pure wurshipper of God, and heir of the kingdom of
heaven: but also a more wicked Jew then he was being heathen, and more in
danger of hell, than ye be. For it cummeth to pass in manner, that the
scholars oftentimes pass their naughty masters.

Woe be to you ye blind guydes, which take upon you to be teachers, and know
not what ye teach, swaruing from the scope and end of the law: and wresting
all thing to no other end, but to your own lucre. For ye say, whosoever
swereth by the temple of the lord, is not bound by his oath: but whosoever
swears by the gold, that is in the temple, he is bound by his oath, less
esteming, through a corrupt judgment, those things that be holy of themself,
than those things that make for your avarice. Or else ye folyshe and blind,
answer me: which is holyer the gold that does garnyshe the temple, and is
turned to your lucre, and into matter of your excess and riote, or the temple
it self? whose holiness causes that the gold being profane in other places,
is there counted holy. Also ye say: he that swereth by the altar is not bound
by religion: but he that swereth by the gift that is, set upon the altar, is
bound by his oath. O blind teachers, for whether ought more to be esteemed the
gift, or the altar which sanctifies the gift? For the gift is holy by no
another means, but because it is set upon the holy altar. And here through
corrupt judgment, ye will have the gifts esteemed holyer than the altar,
because they turn to your profit, whereas the temple and the altar be buylte
to the wurship and glory of God, which ye little regard. With these your
inuencions what else do ye, but subuerte the law of God, which forbids all
perjury? For like as by a gloss ye subuerte the commandment of the honoryng
of father and mother: so here ye teach perjury. It were high perfeccion
utterly not to swear, but yet whosoever swereth by any thing, which is
esteemed holy with him to whom he swereth, he is perjured, unless that he does
perform his oath. Whosoever swereth by the altar, swereth also by the
things that be on the altar. So whosoever swereth by the temple, swereth also
by God, who dwells in the temple. Whosoever swereth by heaven, swereth by the
seat of God, and so it follows that he swereth by him that sits in it:
whosoever swereth by an other man's head, swereth by a thing consecrate unto
God, whereof he that swereth has no power.

byeth mynte, and anyse, and cummyn, and have left the weyghtier matters of the
law: Judgment, mercy, and faith. These things ye ought to have done, but not
to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides which streygne out a gnat, and
swallowe a camel. Woe be to you Scrybes and Phariseis, Hipocrites, which do
exact the least things that pertayne unto your gain, which make but little
unto true godlynes: ye be so supersticiouse in requiring of tithes, that ye
will geather your tithes of herbs, of most vile price in estimacion: as of
Mynte, Rue, Anyse, and Cummyne: and in the mean season, ye set little by
those things that be of most value, and whereupon depends true justice,
that is to say, judgment, mercy, and faith: judgment, that ye do injury to no
man: mercy, that ye help the oppressed and nedy: Faith, that ye deceive no man
with perjury. These things the law so requires, that it would have them
chiefly regarded, where as for the other things the law added them, as of
less value, because of the other. Therefore these things first of all ought
to be regarded ernestly, sith it was thought good that those small things
should not be omitted. If ye observed and kept all things to the uttermost, it
might appear a religion, now for as much as ye let pass these things,
without which there is no righteousness, and care for those things which be
light and little worth, it is hypocrisy, not religion, yea the destruction of
religion. For before the tenthes were ordained, yet vprightnes, well doing, and
faith were required, and pertayned unto the praise of righteousenesse. O blind
guydes, which being of an aukwarde religion, do streyne out a g^at and swalowe
up a camel, supersticiouse in a little thing, and negligent in a great thing.

Woe be to you Scribes and Phariseis, Hipocrites, because ye be careful for
clenlynes disorderly. For ye cleanse your cups, dishes, and candelstickes,
with often washinges, which because they be outward things, do not defile the
mind of man: and that that is within, ye leave unwashed, that is to say, your
mind. For it defiles not the mind of man, if he drink of an unwashed cup,
but if he drink wine gotten with fraud: if he drink wine for excess and not
for necessity: likewise ye wash the body, and the things which apperteyne
unto the body: but ye purge not the mind unclean and defiled with rauine,
filthy lust, and with other very fylthy things. Thou Pharisey, I speak to
the, I say, thou blind Pharisey, which by thy title and religion do boast
thy self to be a master over the people: Thou blind, first procure for this
which only perteyneth unto the matter: if thou fansy true cleanes, cleanse
first that which is within, and than if thou think good, cleanse the utter
things, the body, the apparel, the pottes, the cups, the seats, and the
other stuff: or else to show forth cleanesse in these things, and to neglecte
those which only make us clean or unclean before God, is not cleanes, but
Hipocrisye, and the destruction of true cleanes. For with these your
constitucions ye corrupt the minds of the simple, that they trusting upon
this cleanes, despise those things, which only ought to be regarded

Woe be to you Scribes and Phariseis, Hipocrites, which be so far from true
cleanes, that ye be more like unto whyted graves, and a fair coueryng showing
outwardly a counterfeyted cleanes, where as inwardly they be full of bones of
dead karkases, and all filthynesse. Even so ye with long prayers, broad
Philactaries, large gardes, palenes and fasting, and like colors and
cou^terfeytinges, seem outwardly religiouse and perfect, where as your mind is
full of Hipocrisye on every side, berayed with all kind of vice.

and garnishe the sepulchers of the righteous, and say: If we had been in the
days of our fathers, we would not have been fellows with them in the blood of
the Prophets. And so ye be witnesses unto your selves, that ye are the
children of them which hilled the Prophets. Fulfill ye also the measure of
your fathers. Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how will ye escape the
damnacion of hell? Woe be to you Scribes and Phariseis hipocrites, because
through false boasting of holiness, ye build up honorably the tumbes of the
Prophets, and garnishe the graves of the just men, whom your forefathers has
slain: and making as though ye favored the virtue of them that were slain,
and detest the cruelnes of them of whom they were slain, ye say: if we had
lived in the time of our elders, we would not have consented to the death of
innocents, whereas now ye go about more cruel things against him that
excels the Prophets: and in time to come, ye will endeavor no less against
them, which shall open you the way of everlasting health. For as much as ye
be of this mind, truly ye declare that ye be the very natural children of
them which killed the Prophets, of whom they were monished frankly and freely:
and ye would have been no better than they, if it had chanced you to live in
their time. Go to, be like unto your elders: and what is lacking to their
extreme cruelty, fulfill ye the same that nothing may want. They killed the
Propetes, ye kill him, whom ye Prophets prophesied. O serpents, the offspring
of vipers, o murderers, the children of murderers. Since our malice is so
invincible, since ye can be amended by no benefits, by no miracles, by no
gentle nor rough communicacion, by no promises nor threatninges: in case ye
may escape in the mean season the judgment of men, how will ye escape the
judgment of hell? The which ye heap the more upon you, because ye be not
frayed from the desire of killyng, by the wicked example of your elders. So
many Prophets were sent, of whom ye have slain many. At last I came my self,
against whom, ye know what ye have endeavored.

And I not content with this (that it may be the more euidente unto all men,
that ye be most worthy most cruel condemnacion) behold I will send again
unto you other Prophets, wysemen, and Scribes, which with great gentilnes,
may revoke you from this cruelty unto a better mind: and the murder of the
former times shall not be laid unto your charge, if ye do penance at their
preaching. But ye will not favor them, but some of them ye will kill with the
swearde, sum ye will beat down with stones, sum ye will crucify, sum ye will
whyppe in your Synagoges: and will receive them in no case, insomuch that ye
will persecute them from city to city, until ye compel the^ through your
incurable malice, to go to the Gentiles. With the which thing ye shall so
provoke their of God against you, that whatsoever manslaughter has been
committed of your elders, from the first murder where Cain killed his brother
Abel, unto the slaughter of Zachary the son of Barachias, whom ye killed
between the temple and the altar, being nothing afraid from murder, by
religion of the place, the punishment of all them being put of and differed,
shall be powered upon your head, who have not only followed, but also far passed
the cruelty of all your forefathers. Therefore your misery shall be so notable,
that the whole world shall understand what great cruelnes this nation has used
against every good man: and how stiff their rebellion has been against God,
sufferyng them so long with such gentilnes, and prouokyng them so often with
such benefits unto better things.

After that these things were spoken, the most meke Lord Jesus, who of his
goodness would no man utterly to peryshe, considering the miserable
destruction now at hand of the city of Jerusalem, (for all things were
present unto his iyes) and therewith also their invincible stubbernes wherewith
they should turn gods gentilnes into fury and rage, does bewail lamentably
the destruction of the nation of the Jews, geuyng an incklyng of his second
cumming: when at last the Jews shall repent them over late, and acknowledge
Christ, whom now they deny: where as it were more for their profit, now to
confess their savior sent them from God, and to sing the same heartily unto
him, which they disdain that the children should sing: Blessed be he that
cummeth in the name of the Lord. Jerusalem (quod he) Jerusalem, which
killest the Prophets, and stonest to death them that be sent unto thee, how
often have I trauayled to gather thy children together like as the careful
hen fearing her chickens does clock them together, and noryshe the^ under
her wings, and thou would not? Nothing is let pass of my behalf, whereby
thou might be saved, but contrary wise thou haste done what thou can to
bring destruction to thee, and to exclude salvation from thee. But to whom
freewill is once given, he cannot be saved against his will. Your will ought to
be agreeable unto my will. Behold a miserable calamity is over your heads.
Your dwelling place shall be left to you de^ecte. Ye shall be left to your
blyndnes, until that being once taught with so great miseries, ye fall to
repentance. For I say unto you: hereafter ye shall not see me until the time
come, wherein ye beholding me with the iyes of your faith, shall say: blessed be
he that cummeth in the name of the lord, whom now ye falsely accuse, that he
cummeth in the name of Beelzebub.

The.xxiiii. Chapter.

BUt Jesus to represente with a certain sign and token that the temple and
all the religion of the Jews law should shortly be abolished, departing out
of the church began to go away. And the disciples because they heard sum
mention of destruccio^, they show their lord the hougenes of the temple,
being such a merueylous piece of work, that it seemed pity it should be
destroyed, and further so fyrmely buylte, that it seemed not possible to be
hurled down. But Jesus answered: see ye (quod he) all these? This be assured
of, there is none of all these, so strong, so goodly, or so holy, which shall
not be thrown down, and so hurled in pieces, that one stone shall not stand
on an other.

These things spoken, Jesus went into the mount of Olives. Here, as he sat,
having the temple in his sight, four of his disciples whom he called first of
all, Peter, James, John, and Andrew* went unto him severally to know more
certainly of the time when such great miseries should fall, for they supposed
that byan by after the destruction of the city of Jerusalem, and the hurlyng
down of the temple, Christ would come again in his majesty. But Christ to
make them the more vigilante and ware, so tempereth his communicacion, that he
wills not that they should know the time of the latter cummyng, and yet
thorough the rehersyng of miseries, he makes them careful, and in a redines
against the cumming of miseries. The disciples therefore say: Tell us when
these things which thou speak of, shall come to pass: and by what sign
and token we may know thy cummyng and the end of this world is at hand.
But Jesus not aunsweryng to that which they demanded: turns rather to those
things which should prepare their minds to continual watch in the gospel
I shall come in deed (quod he, Nacio^ shall arise against Nation, an^ realm
against realm. etc.
) but beware lest any man making a lie as touching my cumming, deceive you.
For many shall come, which shall take upon them my name, and say that they be
Christ, and shall find some to deceive, folishe and light of belefe. The
tumult and hurlyburly of all things shall show a certain apperaunce, that
the end of the world is at hand. For ye shall hear of wars, and of
sundry rumors of wars more sore and cruel (as it is wont to be) than the
things their self.

But let not these things by an by discourage your minds, that ye should
think the latter time is now at hand. This troublesome world must needs
arise but the end of illes shall not be forth with. This storm shall sprede
farther abroad. For not only Jerusalem shall be destroyed, but the whole world
shall buckell together with wars and slaughters. Nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom shall skirmishe with kingdom, and the greatest part of
mischief and misery, men shall suffer of men. Furthermore, God taking
vengeance, shall put unto his scourges, pestilence, famine, and in diverse
places earthquakes. And these things be yet no certain argument of the
worlds end, but only signs and tokens of the ill and misery, and as it were
a breding of that last and greatest storm wherewith the world shall peryshe.

And ye in the mean season shall not be free from such manner of illes and
miseries. And ye shall be hated of all nations for my names sake. etc.
For in this tumulte and hurly burly of things, men shall pluck you into
diverse affliccions, and finally kill you: and in the mean season ye shall be
hated not only of the Jews, but of all the Gentiles, not for your ill deeds,
but because ye profess my name. In the mean time many being offended and
grieved with adversities, and ouercummed with punishments, shall swerve from
the professing of my name, and one shall betraye an other, one kinesman shall
betraye an other, one friend an other, and whom nature has coupled with the
bands of charity, they shall hate each other. There shall be also another
kind of ill more greuouse and intolerable. There shall arise false Prophets
and false teachers, who counterfeiting to preach my gospel, shall see to and
provide for their own glory, their own lucre, and their own belly: and
instede of my spirit they shall inspire their own disciples with the spirit
of Satan, and in the stead of the kingdom of heaven, they shall teach the
kingdom of this world. They whom punishments and torments could not
overcome, shall be caught in the snares of these men. For there is not a more
deadly enemy than a familiar and a feigned friend. In these mischifes and
miseries a man shall not look for much comfort of his brothers and friends.
For the multitude of sins being so great, the charity of many shall wax
cold. But yet as for you there is no peril, so that ye persevere and continue
unto the end with a constant and a valiant courage. No greatness of adversity,
can destroy any man, but him that lacks the right mind. And I will not
suffer you to peryshe, nor the gospel to be oppressed. Nay, by these tumultes
and troubles, the strength of the gospel shall increase more and more: and
the storm of ylles shall be able to do no another thing against you, but to
make your godlynes to be the better tried, and the more to appear. For the
end of the world shall not come before that this gospel of the kingdom of
heaven, be preached throughout all the kingdoms of the world, and has come to
all nations, lest they that would not obey, might pretend ignorance. When
this shall be done, than shall come the end of the world.

Whereof if ye seek a token, this is it. When ye shall see the abominable Idol
which shall endeavor utterly to subuerte the religion of the gospel, of the
which Daniell in times past prophesied unto you, saying: and in the mids of
the week, the sacrifice and offering shall be taken a way: and the
abhominacion of desolacions shall be in the temple unto the end of the world:
when ye shall see (I say) this abominable Idol set in the temple, that is,
in the tower of holiness: he that reads the prophecy of the Prophet, let him
understand. This word is mystical, and requires a spiritual reader.

Therefore when this storm shall be at hand, they that be in the cities of Iewry
let them forsake the cities, and flee into the mountains: and they that be in
the tops of the houses let them leap down, and not come down to take any
thing a way with them, out of their houses: and they that be found in the
field at that time, let them not run back to their house to fetch their
apparel. For than there shall be no leisure to provide for their goods. For
it is a great matter if they can save their life with spedy flight. For the other
things may be recovered, but the life once lost, cannot be restored.

Therefore women with child, and women that give such shall be in an ill case in
those days. For they that be great cannot cast of the burden of their belly
to flee away spedely: nor they that give suck cannot cast of their children,
whom they love more tenderly than themselves, like as they do cast of money
or apparel. But as for you, who shall not be let neither with house, neither
with possessions, nor with children, ye must only pray that it chance not so,
that ye be compelled to flee in the winter, or on the Sabbath day. For ye must
flee spedely and far. But the winter by the reason of roughnes and shortness
of days, is not commodiouse for them that journey, and on the Sabbath day the
religion of your law lets you, that ye cannot flee far. For at that time,
there shall be so sore and vehement affliction, as was never since the world was
made unto this day, and hereafter never shall be. And if the calamity should be
so continual as it is vehemente, no man should be left alive. Their malice
did deserve utter destruction, but for the elect (be they never so few) those
days shall be shortened.

In this confusion and hurly burly of things, when my cumming shall be looked
for, men must take diligent head, that they be not deceived through the craft
of deceyuers. For there shall rise many false Christ's, which shall boaste
themselves to be Christ, and be not: but be rather mine adversaries: which
also shall say that they be Prophets, and be not, but rather be the teachers
of errors. They shall not be only furnished with crafts, and a false cloak of
holiness, but also they shall counterfeyte my power with woonders, and magical
meruailes: and they shall take upon them my person with so many marueylouse
iuglynges, that the elect also (if it were possible) should be brought into
error. Ye therefore being monished beware, for I have told you before to the
intent ye should beware. Than if they say Christ is in the deserte, go not
out: lo, he is in the inner parlers, go not in: lo, he is here or there,
believe it not. The second cu^ming shall not be after such sort, as ye see
this, that is to say, soft, mild, and humble, but sudden and compassing the
whole world with the sudden light of majesty. For like as the lightnyng
shynyng forth flasheth sodaynely from the East to the west: so shall be the
cummyng of the son of man. And ye need not to fear, that he shall not be
with me in such a confusion and hurly burly of things. Whersoeuer the body
shall be, thither shall the Egles flock and gather. The head shall not lack his
members.

Immediately after the tribulacion of those days, the son shall be derkened,
and the moon shall not give her light, and the sterres shall fall from heaven,
and the powers of heaven shall be moved. And than shall appe^^ in heaven the
token of the son of man, and than shall all the kyneedes of the earth mourn,
and shall see the son of man cumming in the clouds of heaven with great
power and glory. And he shall send his angels with a great voice of a trumpet,
and they shall gather together his chosen from the four wyndes, from the
highest part of heaven unto the ends of them. The heavenly bodies also shall
feel the greatness of this calamity. For both the son shall be darkened, and
the son being darkened whereof the moon borrowed her light, the moon shall
show no light. The stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven
shall shake, being in danger of falling. Than among the great and thycke
darkness, the sign of the son of man shall shine from heaven, the sign I
say, whereby he overcame Satan, and consumed al his tyranny: the sign, whereby
Satan craked in vain that he had the higher hand.

The which once seen the nations of the whole world shall strike their breasts
when the Jews shall see whom they have offended, when the Gentyles shall see
the majesty of the cross, which they laughed to skorne. For they shall see
the son of man, whom they now despise, humble and simple, cummyng on high in
the clouds of the air with a great army of angels, with a wonderful
majesty and glory. Than he shall send furthe his angels, to gather together
with a sounding trump, all his elect from the four wyndes, from the high top
of heaven to the vttermoste coaste of the same.

But at what time these things shall come to pass, it is not in me exactly to
determine. But yet of those adversities which I have recited, as of certain
preambles and tokens before, ye may guess that the time is not far of. Like as
the figgetree does declare before by certain tokens that Summer is at hand,
as when at the blowyng of the western wind the boughs begin to were render,
and the buddes spryng fu^h, and the leaves desire to sprede abroad: so ye also
when ye shall see all these things which I have spoken of, know ye well that
the cummyng of the son of God is at hand. I assure you, this generation
shall not pass, but that all things which be spoken before, shall come to
pass. Heaven and earth shall perish rather than my word shall be vain.
Therefore it is enough for you to know the signs which do portende and show
the day of my cummyng, lest it come upon you unawares. But it is not your
part to search out exactly the day or hour when the son of man shall
come, forasmuch as the knowledge of these things is not given to the angels
of heaven, no the son of man knows them not. The father has reserved this
unto himself alone. And so it is expedien^e for you, to the ^^uente ye may be
always in a redines.

That day shall cum suddenly, and unawares unto others. Like as in the time of
Noe, when the fludde was told them certain years before, yet they thinkyng
that it should not cum to pass, did eat and drink, and married furthe their
daughters, and married wives until the last day in the which Noe entered into
the arcke, and believed not that the fludde should cum to pass, until they
saw it now at hand: wherewyth all they were destroyed, who by example of
Noe, would not prepare themselves against that day. Like as than a few that
were taken into the arcke were preserved, the other which were lest without,
peryshed: even so at that time when the son of man shall cum, they that
shall peryshe, shall suddenly be divided from them that shall be saved. There
shallbe two laboring in one field, fellows in work and wages, of whom the one
shall be taken, and the other shall be forsaken. There shall be two grynding in
one myll, whereof the one shall be taken, the other shall be forsaken. Yea and of
two that lie in one bed, the one shall be taken, the other shall be forsaken. For
it is not the work, or the place, or the manner of life, but the affeccion
and good desire, shall make man blessed.

Wherefore seeing that these things undoubtedly shall cum to pass, and it cannot
certainly be known upon what day they shall cum: wake and watch continually,
lest that day cum upon you unawares and unprepared. If men watch that their
money peryshe not, much more ought you to watch that your soul perish not.
For what householder is so negligent which if he knew that the thief would
break into his house in the night season would sleep all night, and suffer
his house to be broken down? Therefore ye must wake all your life, because ye
be certain that the day will cum, when ye look not for it. For so ye must
live, that whansoeuer the day does cum, it may find you doing your duty, that
furthwyth ye may be received unto your reward.

Will not a wise and a faithful servant do the same, whom his master going
far from home, has made ruler over his family, to give them meat in due
season? The master does not point him when he will return home, lest he
should be slack in his office: but whansoeuer the master shall return,
shall not the servant be happy if his master find him doing his duty?
Certaynely I say unto you, that the master having a trial of his
trustinci^e, will be bold to trust him with greater things, and will make
him ruler over all his goods. Contrary wise if the ill and unfaithful
servant will say in his heart: my master is long away, and perchance he
will never return: and upon this hope begins to beat his fellow
servants, and neglecting the famylye, eats and drynketh with dronckardes,
how unhappy shall he be, when his master shall cum at the day when he looks
not for him, and the hour when he thought that he would not return? For he
shall not only set him beside his office, but he will also cut him a sonder in
the myddest, and join his part with the Hipocrytes, which has the title and
name of the office of the ghospel, where as in their doings, they be contrary
to the gospel. And there for his sensual pleasures of wrongshaped
sweetness, wherewith being inebriate and drounken he had not awayted for the
cummyng of his master, he shall be punished with intolerable torment: his
laughyng shall be turned into weeping, and his songs into gnashyng of teethe.

The.xxv. Chapter.

ANd Jesus to put in the minds of his disciples surely, that they should not
slack or sleep in this life, but that through the continual service of
godliness and duties toward their neighbor, they should get and prepare
them things for the way to everlasting life: (for in the resurreccion, we
should seek it to late, unless we should prepare in time) he set furthe a
parable of ten virgins, who taking their lamps, went to meet the spouse.
But of these, five were fools, which provided them not of oil against the
cummyng of the bridegroom, because they thought he would not cumme so suddenly,
but that they might have had space to get them oil sumwhere. But the wise
virgins knowing that the time was uncertain when their spouse should cum,
lest they might be found unready, carried out with them in their vessels,
oil for their lamps, whereby they might refreshe the lamps as they began to
fail. Therefore when the spouse differred his cumming long: all the virgins
began to nappe, and at length fell a sleep. In the dead night suddenly rose a
clamor and a noise among the servants calling them out to meet the spouse:
behold the bridegroom is at hand, go furthe and meet him. Than all the
virgins wakyng from sleep prepared their lamps. But the fools when they saw
they must depart suddenly at middenight, and had no oil, their lamps
now faylyng of light, they desired the wise virgins to give them part of
their oil. But they made answer: we fear that we have not enough both for us
and you. Go ye rather to the oil sellers and by of them. And in the mean time
as they went to bye, the brydegrome came and they that were ready, entered in
with him to the marriage, and furthwith the gate was shut. At last come the
foolyshe virgins also, and knock at the gate, and say. Lord, lord, open the
gate for us. Unto whom the brydegrome made answer: truly I know you not.
Wherefore after the example of the wise virgyns, and of the faithful servant,
and the politic householder, watch ye, and prepare in time the stoare of good
works, because ye know not the day, nor the hour of his cummyng, and when
he shall suddenly appear, there shall be now no longer time of well doing: but
every manne shall have reward according as he has done before.

Jesus added also another parable, stirryng his disciples to the continual
desire of good works, that they should not suffer the doctrine and gifts
that he gave them, to be barren and unfruitful through their negligence, but
through their diligence and carfulness, should turn them to the profit of
their neighbor, and so make themselves mete for greater gifts, because they
had bestowed that thing which they had received after their measure and
capacity, for their masters advantage, who desires to be enriched with
such gain. A certain man (quod he) going far from home, called his
servants, and delivered them his goods, not to spend them and lauyshe them
out for their own pleasure, but to get sum vauntage thereof to their
master, of whom they had received the stock. And to one he gave one talente,
unto another two, again to another five, as he thought every man meet. This
done, furthwith he took his journey: He therefore that had five talentes
committed unto him, ceased not, but went furthwith and lent furthe the money
that he had taken, to vsurye, so often that at last by vsurye he gained
as much as his stock came to, and of five talentes he made ten. In like
manner he that had two talen^^s committed unto him, so occupied them, that by
vsurye, he made his gain as good as his stock. Further he that had one
talente delivered him, went his ways for slogisshenes, and hyd the talente,
that he had received, in the ground, thynkyng it enough, if he restored
again the stock to his master.

Therefore after long iourneying, the master returned home and required
accoumpte of his servants, of that he had delivered them, and of that, that
they had laid out. Than came forth he which had received five talentes, and
brought other five which he had gained by usury, making his accoumpt after
this sort: Ye gave me a stock of five talentes, lo, I have gained as much
more to them. The master praisyng the diligence of his servant, says: O
good and trusty servant: because I have found the trusty in a little money, I
will trust the with mo things: enter into the joy of thy master. After him
came he also unto whom the master had committed two talentes, and being
commanded to make his accoumpt, sayethe: sir ye committed unto me the stock
of two talentes, lo, I have gained as much again by usury. The master
commendyng the diligence of this servant also, says: O good and trustye
servant, because I have found the trusty in a little, hereafter I will trust
the with greater things: enter into thy masters joy.

Finally came he also, which had hyd in the ground the talente that he
had received, and being commanded to render accoumpte, doethe not only not
acknowelege the fault of slowthefulnesse, but also accusyng his master of
roughnes, and great covetousness, does double the fault of his duetye
neglected. Sir (quod he) I knew ye were a roughe and a sore manne, ye take
harvest there where ye sowed not: and gather gain there, where ye did no
cost: Therefore fearyng lest if my stock by any chance should have been
lost, ye would have been cruel and sore against me: I went and hid your
talente in the ground. This had I rather do, than to go about to get
gain by usury, and in the mean season to be in danger of the stock. Lo thou
haste that that is thine own. If I deserve not praise for increase of game,
yet I have provided that the stock should be safe and sure. This
communication the master turns into his own head saying: Thou naughty and
slothful servant, thou know as thou say, that I am desitouse of
gain: and that I take my harueste there, where I have not sown: and gather
gain there where I bestowed no cost. The more therefore oughteste thou to
have committed my money unto the exchaungers, and I that hunte for gain
whereas I have done no cost, should have cumme and required my money with
gain, and have taken advantage there, where as I had sown and done cost.
The stock was mine, not thine: Thou were bound to be a diligent servant unto
thy master. Than he turnyng unto the other servants, said: take away the
talente from this unprofitable servant and give it to him that has ten
talentes. And as they meruayled that he commanded more to be given unto him
which had already aboundantlye, the master says: so it shall cumme to
pass in this kind of riches. Whosoever has, he is worthy to receive more, that
he may abound and have plenty: but he that by slouthefulnes has got him
no manner of gain, shall be robbed also of that, that he seems for to have,
because he is unworthy to have it. Furthermore take away that unprofitable
servant from my sight, and cast him into the outewarde darkness. There in
the stead of the joy of his master, which he would not deserve, he shall be
pained with weeping and gnashing of teeth. With such parables the Lord Jesus
pricked forward his disciples both with the greatness of rewards, and with the
fear of punishementes, unto the desire of the evangelical godliness, and also
to do for their neighbors: and to fear them from slouthfulnes and from
boldenes of ill doing.

The which thing he did also far more manifestly and clearly in his last
narracion, where he lays before their lies, both the majesty of his
cummyng, and the separacion of the good from the ill, which now live in the
church mixte together: and also the diverse deserts and rewards of both
parts: shortly he sets before their iyes the whole manner of the latter
judgment: knowing and consyderyng that the day of his death was now at
hand, to the intent his disciples being instructed with so many lesso^s,
should in no case discourage their hearts for the shameful death of the
cross: but should comfort and solace this present affliccion and shame, with
the consideracion of the felicity and glory to cum. And also that they should
not go a^out or with any vengeance to the ill and wicked men, forasmuch as
they knew that according to their deserts, in that judgment they should be
punished eternally. When the son of man (quod he) whom ye shall see shortly
most low and abject, shall cum in his majesty, the companies of al angels
gardyng him, than he shall sit as judge over all in the seat of his majesty,
and all the nations of the whole world shall be called before him. For no man, be
he high or low, can escape that judgment. This shall be done not by man's
conjectures, but by the exact judgment of god, unto whose iyes all things be
open. And first he shall separate the good from the ill, like as the sheperde
when he numbreth his flock, does shed the sheep from the goats. And he shall
set the sheep, that is, the innocents and well doers, on the right hand: and
he shall set the goats, that is, the hurteful and ill doers, on the left
hand. And so the whole number of men divided into two rays or sorts, as a
just judge he will show unto both a just cause of his judgment, that the
good may know by what well doings they have attained unto so great felicity,
and the ill may hear with what offenses they have deserved everlasting
punishemente.

And salutyng the sort on the right hand, with a mylde and a merye chere,
shall say: Cum my friends, whom the world took for vile and execrable, but
whom my father takes for honorable and praise worthy. Now for the illes and
displeasures which ye have suffered for my sake, take the inheritance of the
heavenly kingdom; which by the divine provision and counsel, was prepared
for you of God the foreknower of all things, before the world was made. With
this so great reward it is thought good to recompense the works of your
great love toward me, lest ye might think that they were lost. For in times
paste when I was hungrye, ye gave me meat: when I was thyrsty ye gave me
drink: when I was a stranger, and nedye of harbor, ye took me into your
houles: when I was naked, ye covered me: when I was sick, ye did visit me:
when I was in prison, ye came to comfort me: ye gave me youres such as they
were: now I on the othersyde do communicate and give unto you my whole
kingdom, which is common to me and my father. When these things shall be
heard of the just men, which doethe so use the works of charity that in
manner they know not that they have dooen them, they shall answer him,
saying: Lord when saw we thee hungrye, and fed thee? thrysty and gave thee
drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and brought the into our house? or when
did we cover the being naked? When did we visit thee being sick? When did we
cum unto thee being in prison? Than the king shall say openly, that he would
it to be accounted done to him, what soever is given to any one of them, whom
the world despises for their pouertye and lownes: yet he despyseth them not,
insomuch that he did vouchsafe to honor them with the name of brethren.
Certaynely (shall he say) I say unto you, although I have no need of man's
help, which am lord over all, yet whereas ye have done these things for my
sake to any of these my poor little brethren, ye have done them to me.

Than with an horrible look turnyng to them that shall stand on the left
hand, he shall give a terrible sentence: Go away from me ye whom the world
flattered and praised, but exectable and cursed of my father and me: go into
the fire that never shall be quenched, which was prepared from the beginning
of the world, for the devil and his angels, unto whom ye had rather
stick then unto me. For when I was hungrye, ye gave me not meat: when I was
thyrsty, ye gave me not drink: I wandered and lacked harbor, ye took me not
in: I was naked, ye covered me not: I was sick and in prison, and ye did not
visit me. Than shall they answer the judge with as many words, as the
just men answered: Lord when saw we thee hungrye, or thyrsty, or
wanderyng, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and served the not? Than the king
shall answer them also: Whatsoever of these duties is denied to any one of
these little ones, little regarded of the world, and yet my brethren, I count
it denied unto me. I was nedy in them, I would have been refresshed in them.
This sentence once given, from the which there shall be none appeal, they
that be on the left hand, shall gee into everlasting fire, and the just men
into everlasting life.

The.xxvi. Chapter.

THan when Jesus had ended this communication, where with so many ways he
established the minds of his disciples against affliccions now being at hand,
that they should not utterly be dismayed when they should shortly after see
their lord carried away to a shameful punishmente: at last he was bold to
open unto them the day and the manner of his death. The mention whereof* he
does inculcate and beat into this disciples minds, lest when they should see
it, they should be so amassed at it, as a thing unawares and not looked for, that
they should be utterly discouraged: chiefly when they should perceive that
Jesus came unto his death willynly, which he mough^ have escaped, nor could
be killed before the day came, which he had himself appointed for his death.
And that was the Paasse day, which among ye Jews was kept with great
devotion, renewyng the yearly remembrance of that day, in the which in time
paste among the Egypcians, the posts being sprinkeled with the blood of the
lamb, they were delivered from the kylling angel, and passed over safely the
red sea. In remembrance of this thing, they offered yearly a lamb of one
year without spot: and of the passing by of the angel, and of the lucky
passing over the sea, they called it P^asse. But this was a figure of Jesus
Christ, which should redeem the whole world with his most holy blood, from
the tyranny of sin, who alone was clean from the spots of all sin.
Jesus putryng his disciples in remembrance of this thing, says: ye know that
after two days the Paasse shall be offered, and the same day the son of
man shall be delivered to be crucified.

Therefore when that holy and chereful day was nere, for the keeping of which it
was mete for men to prepare themselves with godly works, the chief
priests and seniours of the people were gathered together, whose authority, if
there had been any rage among the people, ought furthwith to have pacified
it. And they were gathered together in the court of the chief of the
priests, which was called Caiphas: For these chiefly conspired against Jesus,
because they feared lest (if he should be preserved) they should leese
their luere and authority. Therefore it was de^red there through wicked
counsel, that they should lay hands upon Jesus and kill him, not openly
and violently, but by deceit and gu^le.

Therefore when these great men agreed among themselves vngraciouslye of the
murder, they consulted of the time. For although they thyrsted sore for the
innocent blood, being mad with envy and hatred, yet they thought best to
differ the death to an other time, because the day cheeflye holy and
festiual emonge the Jews was at hand. For they feated if they should set
upon him on that day, that the people be wont to resort together, lest any
tumulte or business should rise, because there were many among the people,
which seeing his miracles, and hearing his meruaylouse doctrine, and markyng^he
great sobernes, and gentilnes of his manners, had a great opinion of him. They
feared the people, which feared not god: nor feared not to defyle the holy
day with murder, which durst not eat leaven bread. Satan gave them this
counsel, desyring to keep close that sacrifice which should bring health and
salvation to the world. But it pleased otherwise to the deuyne counsel. For
it was not semely that the sacrifice should be privily cast away, which the
father would to be offered not only for the salvation of the Jews, but for
the salvation also of the whole world.

Therefore when Jesus was in Bethania, nere unto Jerusalem, where he should be
crucified, and sat at meat in the house of one Simon called Lepet, a certain
woman came unto him, having can alabaster of precious oyntement, who broke the
alabaster, and powered the ointment upon his head. The disciples seeing a thing
of so great price powered and cast out at once, they disdayned and murmured at
it. For they knew that Jesus was not wont to use such delicacies, and that it
should have been more for his appetite, if the woman had delivered her
alabaster whole, that the oyntmente being sold, the poor men might be
relieved with the value hereof. To what purpose is it (quod they) to leese
such a precious thing? For it might have been sold for much, and the value
thereof given to the poor? Thus said the disciples not understanding to what
purpose Jesus suffered this to be done. For he was not in love with such
delicacies, but he would have his death to be adorned with such honor,
which death he would suffer of no necessity, but of his own will, for the
health of the whole world. For whereas in all his life he behaved himself
most lowlye, yet he honored his death with a certain magnificence, by the
which death he should ouercum the devil. And therefore once he was carried into
Jerusalem with a great tryumphe: and than, as preventing the honor of his
buryall, he was embaumed with a sweet oyntmente: and when he was dead, he
would be buried in a new sepulcher graven in stone: and he would be wynded
in a clean shete: and he would be buried with the busy care of a noble man.
The karkases of rich and honorable men: be wont to be embaumed with precious
oyntmentes, either for honor, or else to preserve their bodies from
corrupcion. And because he should revive and rise again, before that his
friends should do him this honor, he suffered this pomp of burial to be
bestowed upon him before his death: to the intent he might imprinte by many
means in his disciples minds the mention of his death, and by honor, to
mitigate the horriblenes thereof.

Therefore when his disciples being ignorant of these things murmured and
grutched at the costs and expenses, Jesus refrayned them saying: Why he ye
grieved with this woman? She has done a godly office and a loving benefit to
me, which shall shortly dye. It is not meet that ye should have envy at this
my last honor. Poor men of the common sort ye have always with you, to
whom ye may do good, but ye shall not ever have me. This ointment is not
lost, but this woman gessing that I should shortly dye, with her office and
duetye has prevented my buryall, and has powered upon me being alive, that
that is wont to be powered upon the dead. Therefore deprave not her godliness,
which is so acceptable unto God, that whereas the gospel of my death shall be
preached throughout all the world, this woman also shallbe mentioned: which
with a godly and an holy duty, has prevented my sepulture.

Where as this communicacion had repressed the disdain of others, which
erred of a simplicity, not knowing the misterye: yet it pacified not Judas
Iscarioth, which falsely pretended care for the poor, where as ^ucre and
gayn^ were more pleasant unto him. For he bare the purse, and was wount to
steie sumwhat of ye things which were given of the liberal friends of Jesus,
to be distributed among the poor, hereof by little and little he increased his
money. Therefore when he was wholly given to the filthy disease of avarice,
myndyng to recompense that, which he counted lost in the oyntmente, with the
price of the Lord, he went unto the chyefe pryestes and officers, whom he
knew with bent minds had conspired the death of Jesus, and that there was
nothing to let them, but that he might be taken without tumulte or business.
To bring this to pass there were done more mete, tha^ sum of the number the^
which were familiare with the lord, and next about him, who knew certaynely
whyther Jesus was wont to go. For he had his secret places to pray in. And
there was one found in that chosen and piked humbre of twelve, who^ Christ took
unto him to be the chief over all: which loved better wicked gain, than so
mylde and so beneficial a lord. So great a poison is avarice, if it possess
wholly the mind of man. But Jesus would signifye by this example that there
should be me^, which being corrupt with the desire of money, would betraye the
word of the gospel, and this mischief should chieflye cum of them, who
being the chief and heads of the religion of the church, seems to be privy
of the secrets of their lord: with whom they be so familiar that with wrong
interpretacion they betray his doctrine to the wicked and profane rulers,
which seek for nothing else, but the destruction of the truethe of the
gospel. Judas therefore going unto the officers, said: what reward will ye give
me, if I deliver you him into your hands? And they bargayne with him for
thyrty denaryes. With so little wages could he be ^yered to so beastely and
cruel a deed: so lightly and vilelye was that precious blood esteemed, which
was sufficient to redeem whole mankind. Therefore Judas gredye and gapyng for
the money that was promised him, by and by from that time forward sought for
occasion to betraye Jesus.

Therefore when the first day of seven was at hand, in the which the Jews
were accustomed to abstain from leaven bread, after the eating of the
pas^hall lamb, the disciples go unto Jesus, saying: Lord where will ye that we
shall prepare you a place to feast and keep your Paasse? so great was the
scartenes, that neither he, nor his disciples had any house of their own to go
to. But Jesus to show that this whole matter was mistical, and not done by
chance or necessity, but that all things were done by the prescience and
counsel of God, he answered them: God into the city, and anon as ye enter in,
there shall meet you a certain manne bearyng a pot of water, follow him,
and wheresoever he goes in ye shall go in, and say to the houesholder, the
master says: My time is at hand, at thy house I keep my Paasse with my
disciples. He shall show you a great and a fair parlet, there prepare my
Paasse. The disciples went and found all things, as Jesus had told them
before, and prepared him a feast in the place that he commanded.

And toward night Jesus went thither, and sat down to suppe with his twelve
disciples. And now as they were at supper, Jesus says unto the^: one of you
shall betraye me. This he said to declare that nothing at all was hyd from
him, and also that the conscience of the traitor being touched, might be
turned unto penance. At this word al their hearts began to be very heavy.
Every man suspected and distrusted himself knowing the weakness of man. They
desyryng therefore to be delivered from this heaviness, began for to ask
severally: is it I Lord? Than Jesus su^what to confirm and establyshe the
others, almost dead for fear, and to touch the conscience of Judas more
sharply, if perhaps he might be moved unto penance, pointed the author of
the deed with a more certain sign, and withal put him in remembrance of the
great familiaritye, which ought to have withdrawn him from such a mad
mischief, faiyng: He that puts his hand with me in the dishe, and is my
fellow not only of the table, but also of the dishe, shall betraye me, and for
the office of familiaritye, he shall render unto me the office of extreme
enmity, whereas the communion and felowshypp of bread and salt be wont for
to join men unknown and unacquainted, with the bond of amity. And that
these things should chance to the son of man, it was ordained heretofore of
the father, and prophesied before of the prophets. But yet woe be to that man,
through whose wickedness, the son of man is betrayed.

The divine wisdom does use his wickedness to the salvation of mankind, but
yet he is no less in fault, which through his own malice was brought to this
deed, whereas I omitted nothing whereby I might heal his mind. Wherefore for
so wicked a deed, he shall be cruellye punished, unless he repent, that it
had been better for him never to have been borne. This communicacion which
with shame might have healed an ill man, or with pain might have feared a
wicked manne, made Judas nothing the better, insomuche that he joined
impudency and unshame fastnes to his wicked deed, and as though he had known
himself to be nothing culpable, asked the Lord: Is it I? And here Jesus not
forgettyng his wont tentilnes, answered: Thou haste said, geuyng an incklyng
rather than expressyng plainly that it was he, and makes as though he had a
suspicion, and not knowledge of it.

Therefore in this latter supper yt he made with his disciples, before his
death, he did institute that most holy remembrance of his death: that being
often renewed, it should be a perpetual memorial among them, of his great
charytie, whereby he sticked not to bestow his life to redeem mankind: that
the remembrance of that godly sacrifice should never out of our minds,
wherein that most pure and immaculate lamb the new and true paasse, offered
him self in the altar of the cross for us to God the father, whom being
angrye, he has made merciful to us by his blood, sufferyng pains himself
for our offenses, which were due to our sinfulnes: Jesus did institute and
consecrate this secret sign and memorial in two things, by the which amity
among men is wont to be intertayned: that the charity by the which Christ gave
himself to his, should couple us together also: who oftentimes eat together
of one bread, and drink of one cup. And also showing by a certain
spiritual figure, the rites and manners of Moses his law, in the which was no
purgacion of sin, but by blood of the sacrifice: Furthermore signifiyng that
he did consecrate a new league of the evangelical profession by this mystery.
For when Moses had recited the roll of the law, wherein the precepts of the
law were contained, and the people had answered: We will do al things that
the lord has spoken, and will be obediente, with part of the blood of the
sacrifices which they had killed received in a vessel, he sprinkeled the
people saying, this is the blood of the league, which the lord has made
with you touching these words. And truly all these things signified with
certain figures and shadows, this most holy sacrifice, wherein the lord
Jesus delyueryng his body willingly unto death, and sheding his blood, went
about to cleanse the sins of the whole world, reconcilyng unto God all men
freelye, whosoever would profess this league of the new testament. And he
would that this sacrifice and this league should be commended, and set forth
to the minds of his disciples with certain mystical signs, before that it
was offered, to thyntente that they should understand that his death was not
a common or an idle, but an effectual sacrifice to purge the sins not only
of the Jews, but also of al nations and of al times.

But (because the death of Christ ought not to be iterated) lest so great
abenifite might go out of men's minds, or lest they might forget the holy
league once entered, and the author of their health also, he did institute and
ordain, that with often communion of ye holy bread, and the cup, the memory
should be renewed among the professors of the evangelical law. And he would
that this sign should be very holy among his soldiers, and to be had in such
veneracion, When they were eat in etc.
that like as much godly grace should be given to them, which should
receive the body and blood of the lord purely and worthily: so they that
should take them unworthily, should be the cause of their grenous da^nacion.
Therefore Jesus took the bread into his hands, and when he had offered the
sacrifice of praise unto God, he break it and distributed it unto his
disciples saying: I will not dricke hence forth. etc.
Take ye, eat ye, this is my body. Afterward he took the cup into his hands,
and when he had given thanks unto the father, he drancke before, and reched it
unto them, saying: Drink all ye of this cup. For this is my blood of the
new testament, which shall be shed for many, for the forgeuenes of sins. As
often as ye shall do this, do it in the remembrance of me. For as often as ye
shall eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, ye shall declare the
lords death until he cum, not now as a savior, but as a judge. In the mean
time none other sacrifice for sins shall be looked after. For this one is
sufficient for to take away the sins of the whole world. And I say unto
you, I will not eat of this bread hereafter, until I shall eat it with you
complete and perfect in my fathers kingdom: and I will drink no more of this
fruit of the vine, until I shall drink it new with you in my fathers kingdom.
And the most meke and gentil lord did not exclude Judas the traitor from
this holy memorial, that by this so great clemency and gentilnes, he might be
reformed. But because he received the sign of the league and testament,
having treason in his heart, he departed more unclean than he came.

And after that they had song an hymn in the praise of god, they arose and
went into the mount of Olives, which place he knew to be well known unto
the traytoure, lest he should seem to desire to be hyd, as fearyng death: but
purposelye he withdrawed himself into a solitarye place, that he might be
taken without tumulte of the people, which thing they went about and looked
after. There he tells his disciples again how it should cum to pass, that
byanby they should be sore troubled, seeing the punisheme^t of their lord: but
lest they should be utterly discouraged, he doethe coumfort them with a
prophecy, and with the resurreccion that should follow furthwith, poyntyng
also the time and the place nere at hand, where they should see him again:
all ye (quod he) shall be troubled this night for my cause. For so God ye
father prophesied by the mouth of his Prophet zacharye: I will strike the
sheperde, and the sheep of ye flock shall be scatered abroad: But ye need not
to despair. Death shall trouble your minds, but byanby the resurreccion shall
comfort you. For I will rise again the third day, and after that I am
risen, I will go before you into Galile. There I will offer my self to be
seen of you. Jesus suffered al his disciples to be thus troubled, to the intent
he might teach the^ by the very deeds, how great the weakness of man's nature
was, and how folish a thing it is for a man to trust to himself, that having
experience of themselves, they might learn to help other men's weakness.
Peter therefore not well knowing himself, with a certain manly and worldly
boldness, denies that it shall cumme to pass, which Christ by the Prophecy
said should cumme to pass, and (which was a poyncte of more rashenesse) he
prefers himself before all other: If all be troubled (quod he) in thy
cause, yet I will not be troubled. To whom Jesus answered: what sayeste thou
Peter, wylt thou alone not be troubled? Nay this I tell the of a suerty, before
that the cock crow twyse this night, thou shall deny me thryse, Yet Peter
not knowleagyng his weakness for all this, answered stoutly: yea if I should
dye with the, I will not deny the. And the other of the Apostles followed the
rashenes of Peter, who would have denied Christ also, if they had been brought
to a like straight as Peter was.

Than Jesus knowing that the time drew nere, that the last storm should
cum, he led aparte his eleven disciples (for Judas was gone out from supper)
into a village called Gethsemany. Here he commanded eight of them to tarry,
which yet were loath to depart from their master, whom they loved hartelye,
but as yet with a worldly affeccion. Tarry (quod he) in this place, whiles I go
into my accustomed place, and pray there. For he durst not make them priuye of
his conflicte, since they were yet but weak, l^ste they should be discouraged,
and takes with him but only three, Peter, and the two sons of zebedee, that
he might have them to be witnesses of his extreme manly weakness, whom he
took with him into the mount to behold his majesty: and to teach with all,
that as often as any greater storm of such troubles than man's strength can
abide, is at hand, that we utterly distrustyng our selves, commit us wholly to
the help of God. And the fear of death, when it cummeth upon a man, is more
bitter than death it self: Therefore this horryblenes began than to cum upon
Jesus, and he felt great sorrow and heuines of mind. For he would not that his
chosen friends should be ignorant of the grief of his mind, Tarry here and
watch with me.
that they might plainly see that he was very man, troubled with affeccions
both of body and mind: my soul (quod he) is heavy even unto death. Ta^ry
here and watch with me. For this time requires not sleep, but wakyng and
earneste prayer. Therefore Jesus going forward a little, from his three
disciples, hangyng down his head, My father if it be possible, etc.
bowed his face to the earth: and so prostrate, prayed unto his father,
saying: My father, if it be possible, take away this cup of death from me, for
I feel the affeccion of the body much abhorring from death. Notwithstanding
let it be, not as I will, after the weakness of the body, but as thou will, to
the health and salvation of mankind.

And he came unto his disciples, and found them slepyng, and said unto Peter:
could ye not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray, that ye enter not into
temptacion. The spirit is ready, but the flesh is weak. When he had thus
prayed, he returned unto his disciples, and found them slepyng, and says unto
Peter: Thou that did crake a little before that thou would dye with me,
could thou not wake with me one hour? I wake and pray for you. Wake you
with me, and pray to the father that ye fall not into temptacion and be
ouercum. The victory chances not but unto them that wake. Therefore we must
wake, lest the flesh ouercum the spirit, and the spirit m^ste be sustained
with the help of God.

So his disciples being raised, Jesus went again, and prayed again with as
many words unto his father: My father, if it be not possible that this cup
shall pass from me, but that I shall drynk of it, thy will be done.
Afterward he returned again unto his disciples, and found them again slepyng.
For their iyes were very heavy, by the reason of sorrow increasyng their sleep.
Therefore leauyng them, he went alone the third time to pray for his
disciples, for the weakness of the flesh overcame them. And he prayed likewise
the third time, to teach us to pray continually and vehemently, as often as
the storm of temptacion is at hand. For than the Angels be present and give
strength to the spirit. Afterward he returned unto his disciples, and rebuked
them for their slepyng out of time, since the time required great watching. For
now (says he) the tempest is at hand which shall find you vnreadye, and
therefore unmeet and ouermatched: now (quod he) sleep and take your rest. Lo
the hour is cum, that the innocent son of man shall be delivered into the
hands of the wicked. Therefore arise, let us go meet the hurt and displeasure
that cummeth against us. Behold he is at hand which betrayeth me.

Jesus had not ended this communicacion, but lo, Judas Iscariote one of the
number of the twelve came, following Jesus his captain a little before, and now
become over a wicked cumpany a more wicked captain. For a great cumpanye of
soldiers followed him with sweordes and clubbes, whom the chief of the
priests, and the seniours of the people, had sent for this intent, yt Jesus
might be taken without tumult of the people. For although they had purposed
to differ this matter unto another time, yet having opportunity of the
traitor, they changed their minds. And therefore Judas chose both the night
and the place, in the which Jesus was wont with a few to pray. Finally
lest they should fail of the person, the traytoure taught them by what token
they should know Jesus: whomesoeuer (quod he) I shall kiss, he it is: lay
hands upon him. Therefore Judas Iscariote went before and went unto Jesus as
though he would salute him, saying: Hayle Rabby, and therewith kissed him,
which in times paste was used in salutacions, because of honor and duty. Now
Jesus to give a perfect exaumple of mekenes in every place to his disciples,
did not repel the wicked disciple from kyssyng, nor did rebuke him for his
madness, but with gentle speaking touched his conscience, saying: Friend, for
what cause art thou cum? For he came with a kiss after such sort as though
he would have told him sum news. At this token the multitude came runnyng,
and laid hands upon Jesus, and held him fast. The disciples minds were sore
amassed at this ruffling, whom Jesus suffered to fall into this affeccion,
because he would utterly pluck out of their minds, all gredy desire to
revenge and to defend themselves.

And Peter, either because he was more feruente every where than the other, or
else because he had made stout promyses of himself before, lest he
should seem not to do for his master, plucked out his sword, and stroke
Malcus the servant of Caiphas, and cut of his right ear, Jesus so
orderyng the stroke, that both it was a light wound, and whatsoever the hurt
was, he healed it, and restored the ear again. But Peter erred by the reason
of a certain good love toward the Lord, and this error he took in manner of
the words of Jesus not well perceived. For he commanded them to sell their
coat and to by swerdes: and when they answered, there were two swerdes, he
said: it is sufficient. But they thinking that he spoke of a sword of iron,
whereas Jesus mente a spiritual sword, after supper they took furthe their
swerdes with them ready to defend their Lord, if the matter had so
required, or if he had commanded. Therefore to pluck this affeccion utterly
out of the minds of all his disciples, he did chyde Peter sharply, saying:
put up thy sword into his place. They that do stryke with the sword,
peryshe with the sword, the recompense of vengeance turnyng back upon their
own head. We have no need of this tence, which do get the victory better by
suffering than by killing. Or else think you that I could lack help if it
pleased me to have this defense? Could not I make suite unto my father, and
could not he send to help me in the stead of twelve disciples, twelve legions
of angels? But thus it is thought good to my father, thus it was spoken before
of the Prophets. And none of these things is done by chance or fortune.

Than Jesus turnyng to the multitude, said: now weponed with swerdes and
clubbes, ye cum forth to take me. But when I sat daily among you teaching in
the temple, and healyng the sick and diseased, ye laid no hands upon me.
Now in the dead night, ye seek me out being quiet and still in a secret place.
But al these things be done not by your violence, but by the ordinance of
gods counsel, whereof the scriptures of the Prophets has prophesied long
before. The disciples hearing this, and seeing that there was no hope, for
as much as Jesus offered him unto death, Tha^ all the disciples. etc
they left their master and ran away. But the mynisters nothing mitigate with
remembrance of the doctrine and benefit of Jesus, led him away like a
prisoner, to the house of Cayphas the chief of the priests, whyther the
Scribes and seniours did resort. But Peter alone (for the other disciples
being afraid, were fled every man his way) although his skirmishe came not
well to pass, yet he could leave of utterly the care of his master, whom he
loved heartily* and yet again he durst not be present with him, notwithstanding
he followed as it might be a far of, and at length, in the dark as unknown,
he entered into the court of Cayphas. Finally entryng in he sat among the
ministers warming him at the coals, that whereas he could not defend Jesus,
yet at the least he might see what should be the end of the judgment. For
as yet Peter had sum hope in his mind.

Further the chief priests and the whole counsel, to make sum apperaunce of a
lawful and just judgment, went about to suborne, and set forth false
witnesses against Jesus, whose innoce^cie was so great, that it was very hard
so to lie of him, that the lie might have any color of truth. And after that
many false witnesses came forth, The chief priests and the elders. etc.
but of such sort that their testimonies and sayings were so ill framed
together, that they confounded themselfes, insomuche that they were not thought
meet, neither of those judges, neither of that cumpany. At length cummeth
forth two false witnesses, which said: He said, I can destroy the temple
of God and after three days make it up. They took occasion of this lie by the
words of Christ, who said: looce this temple, and in three days I will
raise it up, meaning thereby that he should be slain of them, but within
three days he should live again. The witnesses to make the thing more odious,
did deprave and mystake these words which they understood not. For he said
not I can destroy, but looce ye: and he said not, I will build again, but I
will raise up, appliyng it to his body which should be slain, and live
again. Therefore at this testimonye because it seemed to be of some weight, and
no another was found more meet and convenient, the chyefe of the priests roose
up, and counterfeityng the person of a just judge, as thought he would give
Jesus liberty to defend himself, said: Do thou make no answer to these
testimonies which be brought against thee? But Jesus held his peace, knowing
that whatsoever he said, should be reproved and mistaken. Than the chief of
the priests desyryng to wreste out sumwhat, whereby Jesus might be condemned
(for now his madness was such that al tariyng seemed to long) says unto him: I
conjure the by the living God, tell us whether thou be Christ the son of God.
This was a crafty question of the wicked bishop. If he had denied that he was
the son of God, he would have cried out: why than take thou upon thee, the
thing that thou art not? If he had affirmed it, he would have falsely accused
him for blasphemy. If he had hold his peace being required and adjured, he
should seem to despise God, and the authority of the high priest. And what
was he that did adjure him? A wicked bishop, which had boughte of Herod for
money the annual honor: and he which did assault the son of God, adjured
him by God. Yet Jesus, as it were showing a reverence to the honor that he did
bear, being demanded whether he was Christ the son of God, Jesus says unto
him, thou haste said.
answered: Thou have spoken: so confessing himself to be that he was, that
yet he avoided the fault of arrogancy. And he added a thing which ought to
have revoked the wicked bishop from his purposed wickedness: yet (quod he) this
I say unto you, hereafter ye shall see the son of man sittyng on the right
hand of the power of God, and coming with majesty in the clouds of heaven.
He gave to understand, that he being than low and condemned of the wicked,
should once come with the power of God to be judge over all the world.

The chief priest being the more provoked with this saying, to thyntente that
through the counterfeyted zeal of religion, he might make the crime of
Christ the more sore, he rent his garments, and said: he speaks
blasphemously. He does usurp and take upon him divine honor, whereas he is
but man. Lo, now ye have heard his blasphemy. etc.
What needs there any more witnesses? Behold now ye have heard manifest
blasphemy. What think ye? They answered: he has deserved death. Than they
began to handle him cruelly with mockes and skornes, as though he had been
lawefully condemned, which also Jesus suffered most mekely, to give unto his
a perfect example of patience. They did spette in his face, and coueryng his
face, they gave him buffettes and blows. Again, some stroke him on the face
with their hands, saying: prophecye and tell us Christ, who is it that
stryketh the? With these skornes and rebukes they cast him in the teeth,
because he would be taken for Messiah, and because he was honored of the
people, by the name of a Prophet.

In the mean season Peter sat without in the court, beholding a far of the
heavy sight, and loking for the end of the matter, for he durst not come
nere, lest he should be known of the ministers. And a certain wenche came
unto him, which partly knew him, and said: Thou also waste one of the
folowers of this Galilean. Here Peter being amassed at the wenches word, and
forgetting that stout word that he spoke to Christ: (and if I should dye with
thee, I will not deny thee:) denied his lord before the^ al, saying: I cannot
tell what thou say. And furthwith the cock did crow. And as he prepared to
go out, even in the door an other wenche spyed him, which uttering him to the
ministers standing by, says: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. And
again he denied it, swearing that he knew not the manne. And a little after,
certain of them that stood by, knowing Peter, said: Truly thou art one of
this number. For not only thy face but also thy speech does utter thee to be
a Galilean. Than Peter being more afraid, began not only to abjure and
forsake Jesus, but also to execrate and ban himself, if ever he knew the
manne. And furthewith the cock crowed again. After these, Jesus did behold
him, and speaking (as it were) unto him with his iyes, monished him. Than at
length Peter cumming to himself, remembered that Jesus told him before, when
he craked of his boldenes and valiantnes: before the cock crow twice thou
shall deny me thryse. But because he sinned thorough the weakness of man,
being amassed with fear, and not of purposed malice, he deserved mercy. Christ
suffered this in his chosen apostle, that no man, offend he nouer so sore,
should despair of pardon so that he repent, and wash the spot of his mind
with tears. For Peter, which was as it were beside himself, at the look of
Jesus, by and by came to himself again and repented, and going forth wept
bitterly.

The.xxvii. Chapter.

Therefore that night was thoroughly watched of the heads of religion, with
these wicked and cruel deeds. And when day drew nere, again the chief
priests and the seniours of the people, went to counsayl against Jesus, to put
him to death. Therefore they delivered him bound unto Pontius Pilate president,
to take punishment of the condemned man. Here Judas that betrayed him, seeing
that he was now condemned, and that they went to extremities, moved with
repentance, brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the heads of the
priests and senioures of the people, saying: I have sinned because I have
betrayed the innocente blood. Truly this man's confession should have moved
the princes minds. He confesses that it was done by the infeccion of avarice,
and he confesses that he has betrayed an innocent. But they utterly raging,
and thirsting after nothing else but innocent blood, answered: what is that to
us, whether thou have betrayed an ill doer or an innocente? Look thou to that.

Than Judas which had betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repented
himself, and brought again the thirty plates of silver to the chief
priests and elders, saying: and have sinned, betraying the innocente blood,
but they said: what is that to us? See thou to that: and he cast down the
silver plates in the temple, and departed and hong himself. Judas now
repenting of his gain, desired to break of his bargayne, but their cruelty
could by no means be mitigated. Judas therefore casting the pieces of silver
at their feet departed away, heaping and increasing his wicked deed with a
more wicked deed. He knowledged the greatness of his sin, but he knowledged
not the greatness of gods mercy. Peter wept bitterly, and obtained mercy.
Judas wept also, but with a desperate mind, rather tha^ a converted mind, and
therefore he went aside, and hanged himself and burst in the mids, and his
bowels fell out.

After this the heads of the priests went to counsayl again, and that their
cruelty might be the better known to all men, they did nothing without a
common counsel. They consulte to what use the thirtye pieces of silver should
go, which Judas had cast at their feet. And being men of aukewarde
religion having no religion nor fear in killing of an innocente, who had done
so much for them: It is not lawful (quod they) to put this money into Corbon,
that is, among the gifts of the temple, which they would have esteemed and
regarded religiousely. For it is the price of blood. But the holiness of the
temple must not be poluted with blood. And in the mean season, they dysclose
their ungracious conscience, confessyng him to be innocente, whose
betraymente they had boughte. Therefore because that they all should be
partakers of the sin, they counseled together, and with that money they
bought a ground of a certain potter for godly uses, that straungiers might be
buried there, as though they would have recompensed the sinful deed that they
had in hand, with this good deed. And yet by this means they provided very
ill for their good name. For they could not by any other means, more blase
abroad their wickedness. For the thing is come to such a common saying, that at
this day that ground is called of the Sirians, Acheldema, that is to say,
the ground of blood. Neither was this thing done by chance, for Hieremie
prophesied that it should come to pass: and they took thirty pieces of
silver, the price of him that was prised, whom they boughte of the children of
Israel, and they gave them for the ground of a potter, as the lord appointed
me.

Therefore when Jesus stood before the president as guilty, they accused him
busily of many things, speaking nothing in the mean season of blasphemy, of
the relygyon of the temple defiled and broken, and of the cummyng of the son
of man, with the which things they knew that Pilate, passing little of such
supersticion, would be little moved: They leye in other feigned faults which
might stir the presydentes mind against Jesus, saying: we have found this
man going about to subvert our nation, and forbidding tributes to be given unto
Ceasar, and saying that he is Christ the king. Pylate hearing mencyon of the
king, because this seemed to touch Ceasar demanded of Jesus: Ies^ stood before
ye debitie. etc.
Art thou the king of Jews* Jesus lest he should seem proud if he should
make no answer, says: Thou sayeste: not utterly denying that he was king,
but yet adding that his kingdom is spiritual, and not worldly, that it
pertayneth nothing to Ceasar or Herod. Again when his accusers called upon
the matter, Pilate desiryng to get out of him, whereby he might be delivered:
Heareste thou not (quod he) how sore faults they lay against thee? But unto
these Jesus answered utterly nothing, insomuche as the president marueiled
greatly, that an innocent man in daungier of death, did keep silence with so
great meekness. Pylate perceiuyng by the countenance and behavior of
Jesus, that he was far from suspicion of desiryng of the kingdom, says
unto the heads of the priests and their folowers: I find no deadly offense
in this man. But they were the more hot and vehemente, saying: he is a
sedicyouse manne, he has styrred the people with his doctrine, walkyng over
all Iewry, beginning from Galile unto this place. Pilate perceyuyng that Jesus
was innocente, but that the priests and the Scribes went about that their
purpose of envy and malice, and therefore seeking occasyon to deliver Jesus, or
at the least to send him from the court: when he heard the name of Galyle,
he asked him what country manne he was: and when he knew that he came out of
the coasts of Galyle, where Herod had rule and imperie, he sent him again
unto Herod, who than, as it happened, was at Jerusalem. Truly Herod seeing
Jesus, was very glad. For of long time he desired to see Jesus, because the
fame went that he did wonderful things. Therefore he hoped well that he would
work some miracle before him also. And when Herod asked him questyons of
many things, Jesus answered him nothing, who came not for this purpose to
delight the curiosity of princes, but to see and provide for the health of
men. And whereas he was accused before him for many causes, and answered
nothing, Herod contenmed him, with his guard: and putting upon him a white
garment in skorne, sent him again to Pilate. And by this occasion Pilate and
Herod were made friends whereas before they were at strife. Therefore Pylate
calling together the heads of the pryestes, the magystrates, and the people,
protested that he had found none offenses in Jesus which they objected
against him: and that Herod also had sent him away as innocente, which he
would not have dooen, if he had judged him in danger of a capital crime. And
to pacifye the envy of the Jews, I will refourme him (quod he) and let him
go.

And when he could nothing prevail by these words, he seeks an other
occasion to deliver Jesus. There was a custom among the Jews that upon that
holy day, for religions sake, the president should set at liberty some one of
them which were kept in hold. He had fast in hold at that time a certain
notable and famous thief, named Barrabas, which name he knew was hated of
the people. Therefore calling the Jews unto him, he asked them whether they
would have given them, and pardoned, Barrabas, or Jesus: hoping that in
comparison of so famous, and so strong, and violente a thief, they would
rather deliver Jesus.

But the president sitting again in judgment, his wife sends unto him one
that should say to him in her name, that he should not contamynate himself
with the blood of the innocente, saying that she was vexed that night with
horrible visyons for Jesus sake. And this chanced not without cause, but by
the ordinance of god, that there should yet be some of whom Jesus should have
testimony of his innocence. For that was very expedient for all men to know,
that his death was freely bestowed to redeem us. And whereas the people were in
doub^e, whether of both they might desire to be given unto them, it came to
pass by the counsel of the priests and the senyoures, that they asked
Barrabas, that Jesus in his place might be killed. Such is the judgment,
and this is the kyndnes of the people: this is the counterseyted religyon of
the pryestes, and the elders. It was a matter of religion to them to enter into
the court of Pilate that they might eat their pascall Lamb being pure and
clean, and it was no matter of relygyon with such ra^^^g madness to put him to
death, which was innocente, and thoroughly tried with so many virtues and
benefits toward them. Pylate therefore proposed unto them again, whether
they would have Barrabas or Jesus set al liberty. They cried unto him:
Barrabas. Pylate again said: Than what shall I do with Jesus which is
called Christ? Trustyng that they would be content with some more gentle
punishment. But they cried with a great consent of voices, let him be
crucified. This kind of punishmente, was both cruel and very slaunderouse,
and shameful. Again (quod Pylate) shall I crucify an innocente? what has he
deserved? I find nothing in him worthy death: Therefore I will chastise him,
and let him go. With these words the madness of the people was more styrred,
crying out: up with him, up with him, crucify the man.

Pylate perceyuyng that prouyng all ways and means he prevailed nothing, but
that the tumulte of the people was styred up more, he assoyled Jesus before
that he condemned him. For in the presence of the people he took water and
washed his hands, saying: I am innocente from the blood of this just manne,
ye be the authors of his death, and not I: the vengeance of the innocent
blood shall light upon your head. Yet the unhappy Jews were not feared with
this saying, but the whole people cried out altogether. Let his blood light
upon us, and upon our children. They wished destruccyon to them and to their
successoures. But Christ more gentile toward them than they were themselves,
has repelled none from pardone and forgeuenes so that they do repent. For
many afterward did wurshyppe the Cross of Christ, which than cried in the
multitude, up with him, up with him, crucyfie him. Therefore Pylate overcome
with their stiff madness, gave unto them Barrabas the author of sedicyon, and
a murderer, and condemned by all men's judgments, yea, before judgment.
But after the manner of Rome, when Jesus was scourged, he delivered him to be
crucified.

Than the soldiers of the presidente, after that they had received Jesus in
the court, gathered the whole guard about him, cruelly to take their pleasure
by mocking of the innocent, partly following their own naughtye disposicyon,
partly provoked by the Jews. And because they heard, that he made himself
king of the Jews, they in manner hitting him in the teeth, because being such
an abject he would proudely clyme up to a kingdom, they spoiled him of his
own garments, and put upon him a purple garmente, that is to say a kyngly
robe. After that in the stead of a dyademe, they set a crown upon his head
made of thorns. In the stead of a scepter they gave him a reed in his right
hand. And now as salutyng their new king, they kneel down before him and
mock him, saying: Hayle king of Jews. Nor being content with these despites,
they spit upon him and stryke his head crowned with thorns with the reed
that they gave him instead of a mace. And when they omytted no manner of
despyte, he suffered all things with great meekenes, to show unto his a
perfect exaumple of patience. Therefore after that the soldiers had satisfied
the minds and the iyes of the company with all kinds of mockes and skornes,
they pluck of his robe again and put on his own apparel, that he might be
the better known of all men.

Than they bring forth Jesus out of the court, bearing his cross. And as they
went, they found one Simon a Cyrenyan, whom they forced to bear the cross
of Jesus, and they came into the place where he should be crucified, which of
the Syreans is called Golgatha, that is, the place of Caluarie, because it was
horrible with bones and sculles of them that were put to death. Here that no
part of his body should be free from tormentyng, or that no mocking or
skornyng should be let pass, they offered him a cup of drink tempered with
vinegar and gall, that it might be fulfilled which is written in the
prophecye: They gave me gall to eat, and in my thyrste they gave me vinegar to
drink. And when Jesus had tasted, he would not drink.

But after that they had crucified him, they divided among them the garments
of Jesus. As for his coat which was so wouen that it could not be rypped,
they cast lottes: that the saying of the Prophet might be fulfilled They
divided my garments among them, and upon my coat they cast lottes. And
fyttyng by the cross they kept him, that no man should take him away. Also
a title in mockage was set upon the cross: This is Jesus the king of Jews.
The which notwithstanding was more honorable than the Jews could suffer.
For they were in hand with Pilate that this title might be corrected, and it
should not be put, king of Jews, but he made him self king of Jews. And in
this thing only they suffered Pylate to have the higher hand. Also this was
procured of the Jews, that two thieves should be crucified with him, so that
Jesus being in the myddest, should have one on the right hand, and an other
on the left hand: that he might be taken of all men, both vain himself, and
a deceiuer, and like unto them with whom he was matched.

The cruelty of the Jews was not yet sacyate and filled with these so great
mischieues. They scorn and revile him being crucified, and passing by, they
railed on him, and shaking their heads, they mocked him, saying: fie on thee,
art thou he that hurlest down the temple of God, and in three days make it
up again? Thou did promise health to others, now save thy self. Thou
did boast thee to be the son of God, now than come down from the cross.
Likewise also the heads of the priests, with the Scrybes and the semoures of
the people mocked him and reuyled him: he gave health unto others, now he
cannot preserve himself. If he be the king of Israel, as he would appear, let
him declare now what he can do, let him come down from the cross, and we
will believe him. He trusted in god, whom he craked to be his father, if he
love him, let him now deliver him. And that of every side the most innocente
Jesus might be arrayed with reuylynges, the thieves also fellows with him in
punishmente, in like manner rebuked him. The which all Jesus suffered with
stiff and strong patience, to bring to pass and offer for all me^ that
healthful sacrifice. He kept still the divine power, and set furthe the
whole nature humane to al manner of pains and torments. And he did not
requited or revenge so cruel reuylyng bestowed upon him, as he was dying,
being more bitter then the cross it self, insomuche that he prayed unto his
father, for the souldyers and the Jews that skorned him: and one of the thieves
repentyng himself, he received into his paradise.

The very Son felt the punishment of the innocente, and could not abide to
behold so wicked a deed. He covered his face with a black cloud, and all
that countreye was covered with darkness, from six of the clock, until
nine. And yet in the mean season, the darkness of the Jews hearts could
not be shaken of. Further about nine of the clock, Jesus cried with a great
voice, saying this sentence out of the psalm. Hely, Hely, Lamazabathany, my
God, my God, why haste thou forsaken me? And certain that stood by, and
hearing afar of, Hely, and supposyng that he had called to Hely for help,
said: This fellow calls for Hely. Let us see whether he will help him. Than
Jesus to show that it was a true death which he suffered for all men,
cried: I am athirste. For this is wont to follow upon wounds and sheding of
blood, which oftentimes is a punyshemente more sore and paynfull than death.
And one runnyng to him, put unto his mouth as he hanged, a sponge full of
vinegar, put upon the top of a reed. Jesus thirsted sore for the health of
men, but the Jews offered him nothing but vinegar and gall. Therefore he did
forbear from it when he had tasted, saying: It is consummate and fynyshed,
sygnyfying that nothing was omytted which did pertayne to the manner of the
sacrifyce. And anon to declare that he left his life of his own accord,
after that he had commended his spyryte unto the father, he cried with a loud
voice, and bowing down his head, died.

And furthwith all things did testifye the effectual death of the lord
Jesus. For the veil of the temple which divided the holy place from the
other part of the temple, of his own accord, was cut in two parts,
declaring that the shadows of Moses law, hereafter should vanyshe away at
the bright light of the gospel. Furthermore the earth did quake, and the
stones brake a sunder, reproving the Jews for their inuyncyble hardness of
heart. The graves did open, and many bodies of holy men which were dead,
did reuyue and live again, and going out of the graves after the resurreccyon
of Christ, came into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared unto many,
being the preachers and folowers of the resurreccyon of Jesus. Furthermore the
Captain and his servants which were there to keep Jesus, perceiving the
earthquake, the darkness, the breakyng of the stones and other wonders, were
greatly afeard, saying: Truly this was the son of god.

And many women were there, beholding a far of, which followed Jesus from
Galile, mynystryng unto him, among which was Marie Magdalene, and Marie the
mother of James and Ioses, and the mother of the children of Zebedee. When the
even was come, there came a rich man of Aramathia named Joseph, which also
was Jesus disciple. He went unto Pylate, and begged the holy body of Jesus.
Than Pylate commanded the body to be delivered. And when Joseph had taken the
body, he wrapped it in a clean clothe and put it in his new toumbe which he
had hewn out of the rock, and rolled a great stone to the door of the
sepulcher, and departed. And there was Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie
sitting over against the Sepulcher. There were also many women lookyng a far
of, upon the things that were done, which had followed Jesus from Galile,
minystryng unto him necessaries, among whom there was Marie Magdalene, and
Marie the mother of Jacob and Joseph, and also the mother of the sons of
zebedee, and diverse other with them. And when the night drew nere, a certain
rich Captain of Aramathia called Joseph, who also was the dyscyple of Jesus,
went unto the presidente, askyng of him the body of Jesus. Pylate marueyling
if that he were dead, a man of lusty age, and not having his legs broken, as
soon as he knew certaynely of the captain that he was dead, he commanded the
body to be given unto him.

He received it, and wrapped it in a clean shete; and laid it in a new
grave, the which he had graven in an whole stone. And rollyng a great stone
to the door of the grave, he departed away: And this was done by the
providence of God, that they should use no cruelty upon the dead karcas, or
that no man should dygge up the grave and steal him away. And when the other
were departed, Marie Magdalene, and an other woman continued there syttyng over
against the sepulcher, and markyng the place where they laid the body, that at
convenient time they might do the duty of annoynting to it, and the lord had
styrred up their great dilygence to this intent that the belief of his
resurreccion might be more certain.

But the day after the Parasceue, which is the day of preparacion, again
the heads of the priests and the pharis^is come unto Pilate, confirming the
truth of the resurreccion, whiles they go about to let it, and they say
unto the president: Sir we remember that this deceiuer being yet alive, said
that he would rise again after three days. Therefore command the sepulcher
to be kept unto the third day, lest his disciples come, and steal away his
body, and persuade the people that he is risen again. Which if it come to
pass, we shall prevail nothing, but the latter error shall be wurse then the
first. Pylate says unto them: ye have a watch, go and keep as ye know.
But they, whiles they go about to stop him that would rise again, they
increase the miracle, and the faith of the resurreccyon. They set kepers and
made sure the sepulcher, they sealed the stone also, which did shut the mouth
of the Sepulcher, lest there might be any deceyte in the kepers also.

The paraphrase of Erasmus upon The.xxviii. Chapter.

ANd when the even of the first Sabbothe day was come, after the end of the
which, was the morning of the day following, which was the first day of the
week next ensuing, Marie Magdalene, and the other Marie, their sweet spices
prepared over night, went again in the morning to the Sepulcher, to see what
was dooen, and to enbaulme the body of Jesus. And there was a great
yearthquake. And when the women devised among themselves, how they might
remove the stone from the door of the grave (for it was to great to be
removed by the strength of women) behold the aungel of the lord came down
from heaven, and removed the stone from the door of the grave, and than sat
upon it. And the countenance of the angel was like unto the lyghtening, and
his garments shinyng as white as snow. The kepers of the Sepulcher loking
upon him, were afraid and so amassed that they lay astonished like dead men.

But the angel comforted the women, saying: These men worthyly be amassed at
the glory of the resurreccion, which do persevere and continue still in their
unbelief: But fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus who was crucified.
Now he has left his sepulcher, and has performed that he promised to do.
This is the morning of the third day. Therefore he is risen. Come and see the
place, which being void of the body, has yet a sign where the body lay:
It has also the apparel of the body, the lynnen wherein he was wrapped.
Let these things make you believe, if ye believe not me. But spedely depart
hence, and tell these things that ye have seen to the other discyples, being
sad for the death of the lord, that he is risen again. Whom if ye desire
to see, behold, he will go before you into Galile, like as before his death
he promised. There ye may see him alive, for whom ye mourned when he was dead.
Lo I have told you before.

And when they had looked in the void grave, which they had found shut,
spedely they returned, partly fearful for the greatness of the miracle,
partly rauyshed with great joy, for the desire and hope to see their Lord
alive again, and they run to communicate this joy to the dyscyples of
Jesus. And as they went, Jesus met them, that they might tell the more
certain tidinges. And to encourage them being fearful, he said: All hayle.
They seeing and knowing the lord, went unto him, and embracing his feet,
wurshipped him. Again Jesus to take from them all fear, that they might the
better perceive the things that should be spoken, he says: fear not, go
and tell my brethren the things that ye have seen, and bid them go forward
into Galile, there they shall see me.

And when they were departed, to the intent the truth of the resurreccyon might
be confirmed also by the testymonie of the adversaries, certain of the kepers,
leuing the Sepulcher, went unto Jerusalem, and told the heads of the
priests, what things had been dooen, how the sepulcher being shut and
sealed, the body was not found. And how the aungel^ being of merueilouse
beauty, removed the stone, and of the earthequake, and how they were amassed
for fear. And how they heard the angel talking with the women. When the
priests heard these things of the kepers, they went to counsel again with
the Seniours: forasmuch as the thing was to manyfeste to be doubted, they bye
a lie of the kepers for money, like as before they boughte the help of the
traitor for money: but that they pay more for the labor of the liars, than
of the traytoure: keep close (quod they) the things that ye have seen, but
make a brute abroad, that his disciples came in the night and stale him away,
when ye were aslepe. And if this inuencyon and fleyght be brought unto your
president, we will persuade him, and deliver you from all danger of this
matter. Therefore the souldyers receyuyng money, did as they were instructed,
and this trieflyng and vain slight was believed of the people. For this
rumoure is bruted abroad unto this day among the unbelieving Jews.

Now the eleven discyples monished of the women, went forewarde into Galile,
and went up upon the hill which Jesus had appointed them. There he showed
himself. They saw and knew him to be their Lord, and honored him, as now
being on high and in heaven. Notwithstanding, some yet doubted, until they were
made to believe, with many and very certain arguments. Albeit their doubting
was profitable for the certainty of our belyefe. Therefore Jesus drawyng nere
unto them, did not only offer himself to be seen and touched presently, but
also spoke unto the^ with his known and accustomed voice: declaring that by
his death, he had obtained a kingdom and authority both in heaven and in
earth. In heaven, where ever he reigned with the father: in earth where
hereafter he should reign, not by tirannical powers and aides, but thorough
faith of beleuers: and that he should dispose the office of this evangelical
kingdom unto his disciples, who should follow his steps, committing unto
them the office to preach the Gospel, not only to the Jews, but also to
all nations: and also authority to baptize, and by the holy ghost, to forgive
sins to all men, that will profess an euangelycal life with a sincere
heart: and to enstructe and frame them, not after the law of Moses, nor
after the constitucions of the Phariseis, but after his precepts* until they
wexed and grew up unto the perfeccyon of the wisdom of the gospel. And
that they should nothing dystrust, for that he should not be continually
conuersaunt with them, he promises that their fellowship shall never fail, and
that he will never forsake his, but be always present with his in spirit and
power unto the last end of the world: All power (quod he) is given me in
heaven and earth. Ye have seen me by the reason of the weakness of the flesh,
hungry, thyrstie, weary, nedy, despised, taken, bound, spetted upon,
condemned, beaten, crucified, covered with all kinds of spytefulnes, and in
manner deiect under the loweste sort of men. Because I have suffered all
these things willingly and of mine own accord for the health of man: my
father has raised me from death, and rewarded me with the glory of
immortality, and has lifted me up to the fellowship of his kingdom, and has
submytted unto my power and rule, all things that be in heaven and earth. Ye
have an author whom ye ought not to distrust, ye have a Lord, of whom ye
ought not to repent.

Like as I dyed for the health of all men: so there is no nation which
belongs not to my right. It shall be your part to get unto me, as much as
lies in you, all kind of men. But ye shall not get them by weapons or war,
but by the same means that I got unto me this right, by wholesome doctrine, by
a life worthy and meet for the gospel, with free well doing, with pacyent
suffering of illes. Go ye therefore as trusty Ambassadoures, and trusting me
your author, teach first the Jews, than the next neighbors unto them,
afterward all the nations of the whole world. Teach what they ought to
believe of me, and what they ought to trust of me. First to knowledge the
heavenly father, the maker, the orderer, and the restorer of al things visible
and invisible. Whose power no man can resist, because he is almighty, whose
knowledge no man does deceive, because he sees all things: whose judgment
no man shall escape: From whom, as from the fountain, cummeth all goodness in
the world. To whom is due all honor, praise, and thanks giving. They must
knowledge also his son Jesus, by whom through his eternal and unsearchable
counsel, he has purposed to deliver mankind from tyranny of sin and
death, and by the doctrine of the gospel, to open the way unto everlasting
felicity. Who for this cause by his will, came down into the earth, and was
borne very manne, of the virgyn Marie, and being man long conuersaunt among
men, taught the heavenly philosophy, which only makes men blessed.

And being an innocent, was afflicted and punished for the sins of the whole
world, and put to death upon the cross. And laid in his grave, the third day
he arose again according to the prophecies of the Prophets. After that, being
conseruaunt many days with his disciples, and the truth of his resurreccion
delared by sure arguments, he went up again into heaven, whereas partaker of
the kingdom and glory of his father, he sits on the right hand of his
father almighty. Once he shall come again into the world, not low and
abiecte as before, but with the divine majesty: not a savior, but a judge,
both of those whom that day he shall find alive, and of those whom now
being dead, the trumpe of the gospel shall suddenly call again to life: that
by his inevitable judgment, every man may receive reward worthy and mete
for his doings. They must knowledge also the holy ghost, whom I have now
partly given unto you, and will give more plentiously, after that I come into
heaven, whose secret inspiracion shall coumforte, teach, and strengthen the
minds of them that trust in me: and being powered into the hearts of all men,
shall glue and confeder them together with mutual charity, as many as
profess heartily the faith of the gospel, of what nacyon soever they come of.
And if a man does sin any thing through the weakness of man, he shall obtain
forgeuenes of his sins, so that he does not sever himself from the league
and fellowship of the holy cumpany. And whosoever joins himself unto this
league, Baptising them in the name of the father. etc.
all the sins of his former life shall be forgeuen him freely. Finally lest
any man should think the rewards of good deeds to be desired in this life,
or should go about vengeance against ill doers, let them know that this
hereafter shall come to pass in them, which ye see dooen in me. The dead
shall live again, and every soul shall be restored to her own body. The
which as soon as it shall be done, whosoever shall belong to this holy
fellowship, and stick constantly unto me, shall be translated with me unto
everlasting life, to be partakers of felicity, which were fellows and
partakers of affliccyons. After they ye have taught these things, if they
believe the things that ye have taught, if they repent them of their former
life, if they be ready to embrace the doctrine of the gospel, then dippe them
in water, in the name of the father, the son, and the holy ghost, that by this
wholly sign, they may trust themselves to be delivered from the filthiness of al
their sins, freely through the benefit of my death, and now to be chosen to
the number of the children of God. Let no man be circumcysed, let no man
be baptized in the name of Moses, or of any manne. Let them all know to
whom they be bound for their health, upon whom they ought wholly to hang.
Let them not be burdened with the ceremonies of Moses, or of man. Let
this token be sufficient for all men that cumme to the profession of the
gospel, which is easy to be had in every place. But lest any manne might
think it sufficient to salvation, once to be baptized, and to profess the
faith of the gospel, they must be taught again by what means they may
keep their innocence, by what means they may go forward to perfeccyon of
the evangelical godliness: I have omitted nothing which may make to the
obteining of everlasting health. And that heavenly spirit which ye shall
receive, will not suffer you to forget that which ye have learned of me.
Therefore whatsoever I have commanded you, deliver ye the same to be kept of
them. I have not prescribed unto you the ceremonies of Moses law, which like
shadows must now vanishe away at the light of the evangelical truth. I have
not prescribed unto you pharisaicall constitucions, but those things, which
only brings true innocence and godliness, and which only may make you
derely beloved of God, and truly happy.

Therefore teach these things to them that profess my name not only in
word but also in life, as I, whatsoever I taught, I performed it in ded^.
Whiles ye be doing of these things, and whiles ye bring mortal men to
heaven, the world will rise against you, like as it rose against me. For my
spirit agrees not with the spirit of this world, and my doctrine is wholly
against the affeccions of them, which love the things that be of this world.
They will rise against you with great tumultes, but there is no cause why ye
need to distrust, though ye be but low and abiecte, unlearned, weak, and
few. I have overcome the world, and ye shall overcome through my help, and
by myn^ exa^mple. Ye shall overcome through my might, and not your own,
whatsoever is terrible in this world.

And although I shall take up this body into heaven, because it is so
expediente for you, yet I will never forsake you. For after that I shall cease
to be with you in body, than I shall be more effectually with you in my
spirit. And I will be with you unto the worlds end, but when the worlds
end shall be, it profits not, nor behooves not you to know. In the mean
season do what is commanded you, ever ready against that day. Which
whansoeuer it shall come, than ye also, your mortality laid aparte, shall be
wholly with me, fellows of my fathers kingdom, which shall never have end.

FINIS.
To the most excellent and virtuous princess queen Catherine, wife to our
most gracious sovereign Lord, Henry the eight, King of England, France* and
Irelande, defendour of the faith, and of the Church of England, and also of
Irelande, in earth supreme head, Thomas Key, her daily Oratoure, wishes
perpetual felicity.
Among the innumerable benefits which we have received of almighty God, most
worthy and excellent Princess, there is none in mine opinion for the which
we are more bounden unto his merciful goodness, then for that it has pleased
him more clearly to illumine us of this age with the knowledge of his holy
word, then our forefathers and elders. For who knows not how long this
realm has been miserably seduced through ignorance of the Scriptures? Who,
even among the vplandishe, perceyueth not what intolerable abuses have been
under pretense of true religion, and Godliness, mayntayned in this Church of
England, till such time yt God of his infinite mercy, sent us a new Josias,
by whose righteous administracion, and Godly policy, the light of Gods word
that so many years before was here extincte, began to shine again: to the
utter extirpacion of false doctrine, the rote and chief cause of all such
abusio^s? This Josias is our most redoubted sovereign Lord King Henry
theyght, a Prince garnished with so many excellent gifts of grace, nature, and
Fortune, that he is in very deed, and therefore most worthily called, the
perfect mirroure, and pearl of all Christen Princes. To wade here in the
praise of his princely qualities, and noble acts atchie^ed to Gods honor,
and the public weal of this realm, is not my purpose, for that I know it
to be an enterprise far exceadyng the compass of my simple learning, and
barrayne eloquence: But only to declare how much we are bounden, chiefly
unto God, and next unto his most excellent Majesty, yt we have the
Scriptures in our mother tongue, and are cured of our old blindness by the
medicine of verity. For now having our spiritual iyes opened, and daily
receiving into the same the clear light of Gods word, we begin to see, and
perfectly to know our only savior Jesus Christ: whom to know is
everlasting life and salvation. But so long as the said Scriptures were hyd,
and kept from the knowledge of the people, few knew Christ aryght: and none
less then they, who appeared to be the chief professors of christian
religion. For what else is it to know Christ, but to know and confess that of
him only, and by him cummeth our salvation? that by h^moure good deeds are
acceptable unto almighty God the father? that by him the fathers wrath is
appeased? that by him we be enfraunchised from the captivity and thraldom of
the deuell? and to be short, that by him we are adopted and chosen to be the
children of God, and enherytours of the kingdom of heaven? Whosoever knows
Christ aryght, surely believes to attain salvation by him only, who says:
Cum unto me all ye that do travail, and are charged, and I shall refresh you.
The very office of Christ is to save: and therefore he was called by the high
wisdom of God (Jesus) that is as much to say, as a savior, because (so says
the angel in Matthew) he shall save the people from their sins: So that it
appears hereby how greatly they are deceived that think to be saved by any
other way or mean then by Christ, or that make themselves quarter saviors
with him, ascribing any part of their salvation unto their own works and
deseruinges. Now how could Christ be known aright, that is to say, to be our
only savior and iustifier so long as the scriptures were shut up, and kept
from the people: And Legenda aurea, with such like tru^perye lay open for them
to pass the time withal, and read instead of the bible? For this cause
chiefly, and also for lack of good preachers, to preach and teach the
truth, it came to pass, that he was almost clean out of knowledge in this
realm, insomuche that (during the time of this great ignorance and blyndes)
many a thousand put more confidence of soul health in works that were but
of men's phantasying, as in pardons, in pilgrymages, in kyssing of relyques,
in offering to saints, in hallowed beads, in numberyng of prayers, in mumblyng
up of psalms not understand, in the merytes of those that called them selfs
relygious, and in other like things, disalowed by god, and his holy word, then
in Christ thonly auctor, as is aforesaid, of man's salvation. But now that
by the gracious permission of our said sovereign Lord, the scriptures are
open for every man to read soberly, and reverently for his own edifying in
virtue and godly living, it is right well known that the foresaid abusions
were doctrines of Antichrists inuencion, and not of god: and that al such as
teach any other way or mean to attain salvation, then by him who says: I
am the way and verity, are false teachers, seducers, and liers. Now do the
commandments of God no longer give place, as they were wont to do, unto
man's traditions. Now have we learned what is our duty to God, and what
obede^ice we owe unto our price, gods chief minister, and supreme head in earth
of our church and congregation. Now is idolatry, hipocrisy, and supersticion,
^^eane plucked up by the roots, and true religion every where planted. Now is
false doctrine exiled, and Gods word truly setforthe and preached. Now has
England clean forsaken Antichrist of Rome, the greatest enemy of gods holy
word, with all his most ungodly devices, and diuilyshe inuencio^s. And all
this came of the mere mercy and goodness of almygty god toward us, who
undoubtedly for thassercio^ of his holy word, and the delyuerau^ce of us his
people out of captivity, ignorance, and blydnes, has raised up in our
times thy Christen Josias, and joined unto the same by most lawful matrimony
your noble grace, a Lady, besides other special gifts, and singular
qualities, wholly given to ye study of virtue and godliness. Wherefore all
England has just occasion to rejoice at this your graces honorable
advancement, yea rather hyghly to thank god that our most gracious
sovereign has matched himself with so virtuous a Lady, in whom is the very
express resemblance of all his majesty's excellent virtues, but specially of
that his graces ardent zele, and devotion in fauouryng and setting forth of
Gods word, the mother of all joyful prosperity. A manifest argument whereof
besides many other, is that your grace so much desires to have the
Paraphrases of the renoumed clerk Erasmus of Roterdame upon the new testament
(a work very fruitful and necessary for the true understanding of this part
of holy scripture) turned into English: and for the xploiture and spedy
accomplishement of this your graces most Godly desire, has (as is said)
commanded certain well learned persons to translate the said work, the
paraphrase upon S. Mark excepted, which the right worshypfull master Owen (a
man of much lerning, and no less honesty, and therefore worthyly Phisician to
the kings most royal person) moved me, your graces pleasure first known, to
go in hand withal, affirming that I should do a thing right acceptable unto
your hyghnes, if I would diligently travel therein. The which thing, being
very desirous to gratify your highness, and with my pore service and diligence
to further, as much as in me lay, ye godly purpose of the same, I right gladly
promised him to do, trusting rather upon the benign acceptacion of your
gracious goddnes, then upon the slenderness of my wit and lerning far
unable worthily to atchiue so weyghty an entreprise. For thauctour hereof was a
man of incomparable eloquence: and therefore it is not possible for a person
scarcely of mean learning (as I am) to set out every thing specially in our
English tongue being very barrain of words and phrases (I will not say
barbarous withal) so lyuelye, and with like grace as he wrote it first in the
Latin. Wherefore I minded nothing less then to contend with him in ornate
speech, and eloquence: but have done my diligent endeavor so to interpret the
said work, that it should be both plain and pleasant unto the reader:
and not only that, but also to discharge the chiefest office of an
interpretour, which is faithfully to translate, and express every thing
according to the true sense and meaning of thauctoure. If I have, most virtuous
Pri^cesse, any where failed thus to do, it has been rather for lack of
learning, and better knowledge, then of any good will and diligence. To speak
here any thing either in praise of thauctour of this present work, or of the
work self, in mine opinion shall not be needful, for that thauctour is so
much renoumed for his excellency in lerning, that my praises can no more
illustrate and set forth his glory, then a candell (as the common proverb is)
give light unto the sun: and the great utility of the other, cannot so well be
set out by any man's praise and commendacion, as it shall evidently appear unto
them that will diligently read and peruse it. If this my good will and endeavor
may be acceptable unto your highness, as the great fame of your bountye, and
gracious goodness puts me in comfort it shall be, I will hereafter, god
assisting me, employ my whole study and labors in such wise, yt the fruit
thereof shall be more worthy to be presented unto your noble grace, then this
rude translacion, the which I am bold at this present through thaffiau^ce of
your natural gentleness to dedicate unto the same. I beseech almighty God long
to preserve our said sovereign Lord, your grace, and that most confortable
flower of all England, noble Prince Edward, in continual honor, joy, and
prosperity.

To the most christian prince Frauncis the French King, the first of that
name, Erasmus of Roterodame sends greting.
THat I have not till this day (most Christian King Frau^cis) enjoyed the
commoditee of your majesty's special favor and benevolence toward me, has
nether been through my defaulte or negligence, neither yet can ye cause thereof
justly be ascribed unto your excellency: but among sundry lettes and
impedime^tes that hitherto has chanced, there has none so much envied me
this felicity, as has this troublous and unquiet world. For I have ever
looked when that in these long storms and tempests of wars, there would
some fair wether or clermes of peace shine upon us oat of one quarter or
other. Neither have I thought my self at any time the less bounden of an hear
unto your bountefull goodness, then if I had accepted whatsoever your grace of
your princely liberality offered me. And I trust ere it be long to have an
occasion more evidently to testifye the earneste zeal and good mind I bear
toward your hyghnes.

In the mean while until opportunity shall serve me so to do, I have
thought good to send your grace the Paraphrase upon the gospel of Saint
Mark as an earnest penny of this my promise. And where I was of my self very
prone and ready thus to do, and as it were runnyng forward of mine own
accord, the very fitues of the matier did also not a little excite and move me
thereunto. For after I had dedicated Mathewe unto mine own natural liege lord
Charles themperoure: and John (upon whom by and by after I had finished
Mathewe I made likewise a Paraphrase) unto Fardynande his majesty's natural
brother: and Luke (which was the third that I went in hand withal) unto
the king of England: then remained there Mark, who seemed to be left behind
for your grace, because the four gospels should be dedicated unto the four
chief princes and rulers of the world. And god send grace that the spirit
of the gospel may likewise join the hearts of you all four together in
mutual amity and concord, as your names are in this gospel book aptely
conjoined. Some there be which extend the bishop of Romes dominion even
unto hell or purgatory: other some give him impery and power over the angels.
And so far am I from envying him this pre^minente authority, that I would
wish him to have a great deal more, but yet would I desire withal, that the
world might once feel this his power, good and wholesome, in setting christian
Princes at one, and in conseruing the same in peace and amity, which have a
long season with no less dishonor, then slaughter and effusion of Christian
blood, warred one against a another to the utter decay of Christ's religion.

And all this while we curse and banne the Turks. But what pleasaunter sight
can there be unto the Turks, (or if any other nacio^ there be of the
miscreauntes that are greater enemies unto Christ's religion) then to see three
of the most flourishing and most puissau^t princes of all Europe, thus by
reason of mischievous division, to pursue each other with mortal battaille? It
will scarcely sincke in my brain that there is any so cruel a Turk who
wysneth more mischief unto Christen men, the^ themselves weorke one an
other. And all this while arises there no peace maker which with his authority
may appeace this ungodly business and ruffling of the world, whereas there
lacks not prouokers and setters on ynowe, and such as pour oil (as it is
in the old proverb) upon the fire. It is not my part to make any ones title
either better or worse with my foreiudgement. I know right well that every one
thinks his own cause most rightful and just: I know also that in all such
judgments that same party is ever woonte to have more favor that*
defends himself from injury offered him, then he that offreth the wrong: but
yet would I very feign that all christian princes, would debate the matier
right, and would well consider with themselves, how much he has gotten
hereby, whatsoever he be, that had lieffer have and embrace an unjust peace,
then wage battle be it never so just and lawful. What is more bryttle, more
short, or more full of misery and wretchedness, then is this present life of
ours? I will not here speak of so many kinds of diseases as reign in the
world, so many injuries, so many casualties, so many fatal calamities and
misauentures, so many pestilences, so many diverse kinds of lyghtninges, so
many yerthquakes, so many sorts of fires, so many fluddes and inundacions of
waters, with other like calamities out of all measure and number. For among
all the evils that man's life is vexed or troubled withal, there is none
where of more mischief and hurt ensues, then of battle, the which yet does
much more mischief unto men's manners, then it does unto their substance or
bodies. For he does the less harm of both, that bereaueth a man of his
life, then he that bereaueth him of his virtuous and good mind. Neither is
battle ever the less detestable and less to be abhorred, because the most
part of the evils thereof lyghteth upon poor folks necks, and such as are
of low state and degree, as of husbandmen, crafts men, and waifaryng men.
For the Lord of all Jesus Christ, shed no less blood for the redemption
of such, be they never so bile rascals and abiecte persons, then he did for ye
greatest kings and princes that be. And when at the dreadful day of dome we
shall cumme before the judgment seat of Christ (where must ere long be
presented all the potentates and rulers of this world, how mighty and
puissaunte soever they be) that rigorous judge will require as straight an
account for those sely poor wretches, as he will do for the rulers and great
men. They therefore that think it but a small loss unto the common wealth
when these poor souls and underlings are robbed, afflicted, driven out of
their houses, burned, oppressed, and murdered, do plainly condemn of
folyshnes Jesus Christ the wisdom of the father of heaven, who for to save
such, as the said persons are, did shed his preciouse blood, and suffered
passion. Wherefore in mine opinion no kind of people is more pernicious to the
common weal, then such as put into princes heads those things that may
styrte and move them to war, who the more high stomaked and courageous they
be, the sooner are they deceived. And among all princely virtues, high stomach
and noble courage of mind is rekened the chief. For this virtue was Julius
Caesar of old writers hygly commended. And for the same is noble King Frauncis
likewise extolled in our time, with the full consent and testimony of all
nations. Now what greater argument is there of a very lofty and courageous
mind, then to be able nothing to pass upon injuries? The doughtynes and
valiau^tise of the old Capitaines who warred for empire, and not for defense
of life, is much renoumed and praised, but in Gentyle writers, and of Panyms
or Gentiles. Certes it is a much more honorable and glorious fact for a
christian prince to bye peace and tranquillity of the common weal with the
loss of some part of his dominion and inheritance, then for victory obtained
to be received with much goodly triumph, bought with so great displeasures of
the people. Therefore such as have ince^sed the minds of princes with a desire
to enlarge their empire, what else have they invented but a continual fountain
and quick spryng of wars. Again as much mischief do they in the world
that minister unto the same princes occasion and matter of wrath, bearyng them
in hand that it is a thing appertainyng unto princely manhod or couragiousnes,
to be avenged by force of arms for some folyshe word spoken, which happily
was untruly reported, or at the lestewyse made a great deal worse, and more
heinous then it was spoken in very deed. But how much greater a point is it
of a noble courage, for consideracio^ to have the peace and tranquillity of the
common wealth conserved, nothing to pass upon a raylyng word? For if any
hurt cumme thereof, it is but a private hurt, yea, to say the truth, it
hurts not at all, if it be neglected and not passed on. And in other matters
concerning worldly affairs, kings peradventure may take sum vacacion, and
now and then sequestre them selves from buisynesse, at least wise if it be
lawful for them to be any where idle and without business, unto whose office
it specially belongs to watch, for the preseruacion and safegarde of so
many. But in taking upon them the dangerous enterprises and adventures of
war, forsomuche as the same brings with it a whole floude of great euylles
and mischiefs, they ought with all the iyen in their heads to watch, and to
be as circumspect as is possible to be, lest they decree and determine any
thing unadvisedly. Neither speak I these things (most christen King) of any
entente to pluck the swearde out of the hands of princes. For peradventure it
is the part of a good king sumtymes to make war, but that must be at such
time, when all other things having been assayed in vain, extreme necessity
compels him so to do. The lord Jesus took away the use of the sweorde
from Peter, but not from princes. Saint Paul also confirms their
authority, commanding such as in the city of Rome professed Christ's
religion, in no wise to contemn thautoritie of their sovereign rulers,
although the same were Gentiles and miscreauntes, in so much that he would
not have taken from them, being as the very ministres of God, neither their
customs, their taxes or talages, nor their honor. Takes he the sweorde from
them, who says: For he bears not the sword for naught? The self same
thing doethe Peter also teach being one of ye chief Apostles, saying:
Submit your selves therefore unto all manner of ordinance of man, for the
lords sake, whether it be unto the king, as unto the chief head: either unto
rulers as unto them that are sent of him, for the punishment of evil dooers,
but for the laud and praise of them that do well. etc. Christ would have
Peter to have no weapon save the sweorde of the gospel, which is the
heavenly word, the which as saint Paul teaches in the epistle to the
Hebrews, is quick and mighty in operacion, and sharper then any two edged
sweord: and entrethe through, even unto the dividing asoudre of the soul and
the spirit. For he that commands the sweorde to be put up into the
scaberte, and takes it not away, does more then if he took it away. For why
does he command it to be put up? Truly because the uangelyke pastoure
should in no case make war. Why does he neither command it to be laid
aside, nor yet forbid it so to be. Uerayly to do us to understand, yt we
ought not so much as then to go about to be avenged, when we are of power to
revenge the iniuties done unto us. Wherefore I conclude, that the euangelyke
pastoures have the sweord of the gospel delivered them of Christ, wherewith
they sleagh vices, and cut away man's carnal lusts and desires. Kings also
and temporal princes have their sweorde by his sufferaunce and permission, to
make euillmen afearde, and to prefer good men accordingly. The sweorde is not
taken from them: but the use thereof is prescribed. They have it for a defense
and couseruacion of the public tranquillity, and not to bolster, and maynteyne
therewith their own ambiciousnes. There are two manier of sweordes, and
likewise two manner of kingdoms: The priests and bishops have their sweorde,
and also their kingdom. Instead of Diademes and helmettes they have their
Myters: Instead of a scepter they have a crosyers staff: they have their
brigandyne, their soldiers girdle, and to be short, all that complete harnes
which that valiant warrior Saint Paul describes unto them in sundry
places. These euangelyke kings are called pastors, so likewise are temporal
kings named of the Poet Homer, pastors of the people. They both do one
thing, and yet is their office and ministry diverse, even like as we see that
in the same interlude and play, some play one part, and some an other. But if
they both had each of them their own sweord in a readiness, I mean, if each
of them would use the power given them aryght, and as they ought to do, I
think verily that we (who are rather christen men by name, then in deed) would
not so often times draw out our wicked sweordes to thruste them into the
bellies of our christen brethren. Now whiles they both nothing regardyng
their own duty, have each one a desire to entermeddle with that, which in
no wise appertains unto their vocacion, it cummeth to pass that neither of
them both do maintain their own dignity accordyngly, nor yet conserve the
public tranquillity. When has a king more kyngly majesty, then at such
time as he sits in judgment, and ministers justice: then when he
represseth injuries, ends centrouersies, helps the oppressed? or when he
sits in counsel studying how to advance the common wealth? On the other
side, when has a bishop more of his dignity, then at such times as he
preaches the doctrine of the gospel out of a pulpit? For then is that
euangelike king in his seat royal.

Look how vnsemyng a thing it was for the Emperor Nero to contend with the
masters of Musyke and with harpers in the stage, or to prove maisteries with
wagoners in the lystes or turneying place, called in latyne Circus: so unseemly
a thing it is for a king to meddle with low and peltrie matiers that perteine
unto his own private affeccio^s, and hurt the prosperous state of the common
wealth. Again look how uncomely a thing it were if a Philosophier would with
his cloak and long beard scip about the stage, and play a part in an
interlude: or else hold a bill and a net in his hand in the place where the
swordplayers are wont to fight at vtteraunce, and sing their accustomed song:
I would not have the, I would have a fyshe, cock why flye^^ thou from me?
even no less unseemly a thing it is for the euangelike king to play the
warryer, to bye and sell, I will not speak of other things more dishonest, and
less agreeable with his vocacion. How chances it that there is any one
bishop in our days that thinks it a goodlyer thing for him to have in is
train. CCC. horsemen well appointed with crosbowes, iauelins, and handegunnes,
then to be accompanied with a good number of learned and virtuous deacons, and
to carry about with him books of holy scripture?

Why do they thynk them selves great by the pompous show and setting forth
of those things, by contemnyng whereof, such as they succeeded were accounted
great and worthy persons? Why have trumpettes and horns a sweter sound in
their ears, then the readyng of holy scripture? Well then, what if a king in
stead of a Diadem, and a robe of estate, put on a Myter and a priests
attire? and contrary a bishop instead of a Myter and priests attire wear a
Diadem, and a kings robe or kyrtel-wil it not appear a monstreous sight unto
us?

Now if the unright and disordered use of such things as are but signs of
their office and ministeries do so greatly move us, why then are we not a
great deal more moved to see their offices turned clean came, and misordered?
Certes if either king o^ bishop do any thing privately, they must have
respect to nothing else, but to the health and conseruacion of the people. For
if they do their duty aright, either they admonish such as are out of the
way, correct such as have done amysse, or coumforte the dismayed, or keep
under the proud and hye minded, or stir up idle persons, or make those that
are at variaunce friends and lovers again. This is the very office of kings
but specially of the euangelike kings, who in no wise ought ambiciously to
desire this worldly kingdom. And forasmuch as the Lord Jesus was in very
deed both a spiritual and a temperall king (although he expressed in yerth but
a spiritual kingdom alonely) it is both their parts to do what in the lies
to counterfaicte and follow their prince.

He wholly gave himself for his. And how then for shame dare any that calls
himself Christ's vicar, live only to his own private wealth and commodity?
Christ whether he were in the temple, or in the Synagoges, or went abroad, or
tarried at home in his several house, or were carried by water, or continued in
the wilderness, did nothing else all his life long but play the part of a
savior, of a comforter, of a well dooer. He taught the multitude, he healed
the diseased, he cleansed the lepres, he restored the sick of the palsy, the
lame and the blind. Further he chased away hurteful spirits, raised the dead,
delivered those that were in peril, filled the bellies of the hungry, reproved
the Phariseis, defended his disciples, and also the sinner that so lauishely
poured out her oyntmente upon him.

He coumforted the sinful woman of Canaan, and her that was taken in
adulterye: Peruse all the whole life of Jesus, and it shall evidently appear
that he never harmed any body, notwithstanding he had so many hurtes and
displeasures done to him of others, and that he could eas^ly have been avenged
if it had pleased him.

He every where played the savior, euerywere the well doer.

He restored Malchus ear again which Peter cut of with his swe^rd. He would
not have his safegarde defeded with ye least hurt or displeasure that might be
to any body. He made Herod and pilate at one. Hangyng on the cross he saved
one of the thieves. When he was dead he drew the captain of the garrison unto
the christian profession. This was the very office and part of a king, to do
all men good, and hurt no body. His example all christian princes ought as
nygh as they can, to follow. And forasmuch as your grace is called the most
christian king, the very name and title self that is given your highness, ought
specially to move you to express in all your doings, as nere as ye can
possible, the prince of all princes, Christ. But what sparcle of shame
remains there in those persons, who albeit they have a pleasure to be called
the vicars of Christ, do notwithstanding require to have (I say not their
life or dignity) but their avarice and pride defended with great effusion and
shedyng of christian blood? And this write I (right noble prince) not for to
defame or reprove any bishops (albeit I would wish of God that there were not
some christian bishops of whom these words might beiustely spoken) but only
to show wherein ye true dignity of kings and bishops consists, to the
end that both of them knowing and mayntening their own dignity, may
happily passover this transytorye life to Gods pleasure and contentacion.
But much farther are those euangelike pastors from doing their duty, who,
where it had been their part to make princes being at debate and variaunce at
one again, do of their own accord incense them to war, and as it is an old
proverb, do cast brandes upon the fyers or flames of battle. Surely if ever
it were needful for a good pastor or shepherde any where to provide for the
safegarde of his flock with the loss and spendyng of his life: if the example
of that chief shepherde Christ, in whose stead they are, were any where to be
expressed and followed, here chiefly ought they to have do one their duty,
whereso great a sea of mischiefs gusseth and flows out into the world. But
how chances it that among so great a noumber of Abbottes, bishops and
Archebishops, and Cardinals, not one steppeth forth that dare put, yea even
his veraye life in hasarde, to make an end of this great stirryng and
troublous buisynes of the world? How happily dies he, whosoever by his death
causes so many thousand men's lives to be saved? There is no crueller a
thing, then is that fyghting hand to hand, and bucherly manglyng and cuttyng
of sweard players: And yet was antiquity so fondly delyted with this sight,
that the most naughty and detestable example remaynyng of the use of the
Gentiles, continued a long season, even among christen men, namely in the City
of Rome, which could not yet forget her old paganitie. But that this manoure
of fyghtyng is utterly set aside, we may thank (as witnesses the historye
called the tripartite history) one Telemachus a man of their order and
profession, who for christian simplicity, and a desire they had to lead a
solitarye life, and to eschew the company of the sinful multitude, were
commonly called monks or solytarye persons. This Telemachus came for this
purpose out of the east parties to Rome, and entryng into the place (which
was called of them Theatrum, that is to say, a place ordained to behold
shows and pastimes in) when he saw two armed men come into the fightyng
place, and about to sley one another, he leaped betwixt them as they were in
their furye and rage, crying and saying with a loud voice: What do ye
brethern? why go ye about like wild beasts to murder one another? To make
short tale, whiles the good man went about to save both their lives, he lost
his own, being stoned to death of the people: So much did the dotyng
multitude set by this cruelliye pastime and pleasure. But what came of this?
Honorius the Emperor, as soon as he was enfourmed hereof, commanded this manner
of showing the people pastyme by couplyng or matchyng together of swearde
players, to be left and utterly abolyshed. Now mark me well how dishonest a
pastyme it was, and how many thousands had by reason thereof been miserablye
slain and murdered, and then shall it evidently appear how much the world is
bo^den unto this one man's death. And for this fact was Telemachus worthily
canonized and made a saint. How much more then by all right and reason
should he deserve to have like honor given him, that would adventure his
life to part so mighty and puissaunt princes, that thus war and fight
continuallye ^ne against another? For the commonwealth susteyneth no great
loss if a swerdplayer kill a sweardplayer, and one ungracious varlet sleyeth
another: And yet as princes cannot be enemies together without the utter
detr^ment and annoyaunce of the whole world: so contrariwyse may they with
less ieopardy be parted, then Telemachus parted the sweard players: first
because they are christen men, and secondarily because the more noble courage
and stomach they be of, the more tractable they are, if any bishop; or else any
other prelate of the church go about to persuade them without craft or
dissimulacion. Now if any chance upon such a prince as can by no means be
entreated, but is of a tyrannous and cruel nature: then let him consider how
the greatest hurt and displeasure that the cruellest tyranne in the world is
able to do, is but death.

And where I pray you shall the successors of the Apostles show an exaumple
of an Apostolyke spyrite, if they show it not in this case? Some will
heresaye: What shall my death prevail, if I have not my desire? I answer:
Christ the reward gyuer will not see his champion to lose his reward. Albeit
many times death obteyneth, what life could never bring about. For the death of
virtuous men is of no small power and efficacy.

I will not here stand in the recital of old exaumples which are
^^^^merable. John Baptist was beheaded for his frank speaking: but al princes
are not Herodes: nor all have not such peramours as Herodias was. Ambrose
bishop of Myllayne shranke not to suspende Theodosius the Emperor out of the
church, for his cruel and rash sentence against the Thessalonians, and after
he had sharply rebuked him, and commanded him to make satisfaccion, he put him
to his penance. And sorthwith the majesty of so mighty a prince gave place,
and was obedient unto the authority of a bishop.

The holy man Babylas Bishop of Antioche attempted to use like severity
against a king which had murdered an innocent, and he was slain for his
labor: but anon as he was dead, he began to be feared not only of the
heathen Emperor, but also of the deuyles, which were as yet in these days
wurshypped for Gods. I have (right excellent prince) such an opinion of the
Emperors maiestes nature, of your Graces disposicion, and of the king of
Englandes good nature, and virtuous inclinacion, that I put no doubts but you
all would long ere this have followed good aduertisementes, if there had been
any such counsaillour, which would have been plain and frank with you all
with discretion, and discrete with frank plains.

And all this while there lacks not great plenty of such as incense the
minds of princes to battle, namely of those persons whom it behooves,
forasmuch as their profit and living depends thereupon, to have all the
world in an uproar, and unquieted with wars. One says: he sets your
majesty at naught: he gave your grace such a mock. Another, if your
highness join this part unto your dominions, you may also at your pleasure
easily join that. O unadvised and rash counsaylour. Why do thou rather put
into his head how far he may extend the bounds of his dominions, then put
him in remembrance with how narrow lymites the seignorie, which he has
now at this present was in old time bounded. Why do thou not show him
which* way that he has may be well governed, rather then enlarged? The
extending of bounds is endless: and therefore most true it is that Seneca
reports: Many Emperors and princes have encrothed upon others, and taken
their marches from them: and yet never none till this day has appointed
himself any lymittes to be content withal. But the very true commendacion of
a prince stands in well governing. Alexander the great when he was come to
the Oecian sea, wished there had been another world for him to conquer, as
who say this, world was to little to satisfye his ambiciousnes, and desire
that he had to enlarge his Empier. Hercules never went beyond the yles called
Gades. But no Oecian, no Gades can bound our insaciable ambicion. Howbeit
against the pestilent words of such persons, christian princes ought to have
their minds diligently fortyfied before hand, with the decrees and sayings of
Christ, as it were with triacles or preservatives against poison, and in all
their counsayles to have special regard unto the rule of the gospel, as unto
a mark.

Peradventure your majesty will ask what I mean to sing so long a song unto
your highness, sense the same is most occupied about the weightye affairs
of the common wealth. Yea, my desire was to have this song songen to all
men, for no cause else, but for that this universal calamity of the world
greueth me very sore, and also for that I much desire to see more tranquillity
and quietness in every part of Christendom, but specially in the realm of
France, then which kingdom I wot not whether there be any more excellent
either in true christianitye and goodlyuing, or else in worldly abundance and
prosperity. Now if such rufflyng and troublous busynes did seldom when
chance, like as great fluddes, earthquakes, or famine are wont to do, then
were it a thing more tolerable: but so it is that the world is continually
troubled, and never at quiet by reason of such discord and division. The
physycians whenever there chances any new bodily diseases, do wittely
search out the causes of the malady, the which once known, then do they
easly cure it: And not only contented thus to do, they also invent ways to
let that the same plague may not often times begin to rage afreshe, or reign
again. Why therefore in these so great evils, and so many times chauncing, do
not men of great wisdom and experience semblably search out the wells that
all this troublous business so often springs out of into the world, to the end
that the roots thereof being clean cut up and destroyed, they may perfitely
cure and remeady the same? why are we quycke syghted in things of litell weight
and importance or none at all, and in the weightiest thing of all more then
half blind? Mine opinion is, that battle for the most part springs of
vain words or titles as it were invented to nourishe ma^s pride and vain
glory, as who say, there were not ambicion enough in the world, unless we
fed and maintened this naughty vice with newly invented titles, the which
vice of it own propre nature grows to fast in us. These, and such other
like roots and chief causes of battle being once cut away, then should it
be easy to conclude and establishe a peace among christian princes, with such
laws and conditions that would never suffer such ruffling business and
hurly burly to begin again. By this means should the princes increase in
richesse, now being common between them by reas^n of amity and friendship: and
the christian people should live in lovely peace and tranquillity under their
most wealthye princes. So would the lord Jesus, that true king of the whole
world, be favorable unto us: and cause all things to prosper and go forward
with us. So should we be feared of the enemies of Christ's religion against
whom we have much a do at this day to defend our own, much less than are we
able to discoumfite them and chase them away far from us: Albeit I had rather
have them reformed of their misbeliefe, then by force of arms chased away and
put to flight. But how is it possible for us to reform other, if our selves
be (I had almost said) worse and more vicious in our conversation then they
are? For I do not here esteem christian men by the articles of the faith
which we profess with mouth, but by their manners and lyning. Wheresoever
ambicion, covetousness, pride, wrath, reuengemente, and a desire to hurt
reigns, there (say I) lacks the faith of the gospel. Now albeit this
pestilence have infected, even those unto whose office it chiefly apperteined
to see a remedy for the decay of christen religion, yet have I some good hope
of reformacion, because I see the books of holy scripture, but specially of
the new testament so taken in hand, and labored of all men, yea even as much
as of the ignorant and unlettered sort, that many times such as profess the
perfyte knowledge of Gods word, are not able to match them in reasonyng.
And that there be very many readers of the books of the new testament, this
one thing makes me to believe, because notwithstanding the printers do yearly
publishe and put forth so many thousand volumes, yet all the bookesellers
shoppes that be, are not hable to suffice the gred^^es of the buyers. For now a
days is it well sold ware whatsoever a man attempteth upon the gospel. This
so strong a medicine once received and dronken can not but work and put
forth his strength. Wherefore me thinks the world is in case like to a man's
body vexed with grievous diseases, after it has received an herb called
Ellebore, or some other strong purgacion. For then is it all together
distempered and out of quiet, and fares as though it would yield up the
ghost. And God send grace that this euangelike Ellebore, after it have once
searched and entered into all the veins of our soul, may so come up again,
that (the seeds of vices being thereby cast out and avoided) it may restore us
made whole and purged of all our sins, unto Jesus Christ, and may also after
this great rufflyng and almost incurable diseases of the world, bring again
unto all men that ioyefull and much desired tranquillity. And verily I would
hope better that the common prayers of all good men to that end and purpose
should not be made in vain, if the chief estates of the world, would like
trusty and faithful physycians, do their endeavor to help the world in this
evil case, that is to say, if the princes, in whom it chiefly lies to rule
the world as they will, would call unto their remembrance that they shall
shortly (for what thing is there in this present life of any long
continuance) give an accoumpt unto that most sovereign and high prince, how
they have governed their dominions: Again if the bishops, divines, and all
ecclesiastical persons would likewise remember, how they have not succeeded
in the places of Annas and Caiphas, or of the Scribes and Phariseis, (who
whiles they wickedly defended their own kingdom, went about to oppress the
kingdom of the gospel: whiles they vphelde and defended their own glory,
did their endeavor to bury and over whelme Christ's glory: and finally, whiles
they labored to approve their own righteousness, made God unrighteous) but
rather in the place of the Apostles, who had a pleasure even with the leesyng
of their own blood and lives to defend Christ's kingdom, Christ's glory,
and Christ's righteousness. Christ has once suffered, once arysen again from
death to life, and never will dye again. But he suffers the same passion
afreshe, so often as the truethe of the gospel is condemned, beaten, spytte
upon, crucified, and buried. To be short, he reckeneth done unto himself,
whatsoever evil or displeasure is done unto his members. Peradventure (most
Christian king) I have spoken here more frankely, and more at large then it
became me to do: howbeit the great love I bear toward your grace has made me
both lauishe of my words, and also more bold to utter my mind unto your
highness: I being a Christian man, do wish well unto all Christian men
generally: but yet have I a certain special love and affeccion to the most
noble and florishyng realm of France. I beseech Jesus thimmortall king of the
whole world, unto whom the heavenly father has given all power in heaven and
in earth, to give his holy spirit both to the people, and also to the princes
and rulers: to the princes, that they may have grace happily to pass over
their lives in mutual amytie and concord under their common king and prince
Jesus: unto the other, that they may live in rest and peace under their most
godly and wealthy princes: and the end of all to be this, that christian
virtue and godliness being well planted among us, may be enlarged and spread
abroad as much as is possible to be, not by inuadyng or wasting of others
dominions or countries (for so our enemies become the porer, but never the
better and more godly) but by preaching every where the doctrine of the gospel
syncerely and truly, by their ministry that have in them the spirit of the
gospel: and by ordering our lives after such sort, that very many may be
allured to profess our religion even by the sweet smell or savor of our good
living. So be ganne the christian empire, so encreaced it, so was it greatly
enlarged, so was it established: and by the contrary we see how it is now
almost at a point and come to nothing, if we considre the greatness of the
whole world. Wherefore look by what aids it first began, by what means it
was encreaced, and established, by the same must we repair it being decayed,
enlarge it being brought into narrow room, and finally establishe it again
being unstable and at no sure stay. These things write I (most christian
prince) of a pure zele and good mind, neither reprehending any man, sense I
bear all men my good will, neither flatteryng with any, or corying favor,
because I seek naught at no man's hands. Almighty God grant your highness
well to fare.

Yeuen the first of Decembre, in the year of our lord, M.CCCCC.xxiii.
The life of S. Mark written by S. Hierome.
Mark the disciple and interpreter of Peter, being desired of the brethren at
Rome, wrote a short gospel according as he heard Peter preach and show
every thing by mouth. The which gospel the same Peter, after he had heard
it, did allow and publishe by his authority, because it should be red of the
congregation, as records Clement in ye sixth book of his work entitled,
Dispositiones. Of this Mark, Papias also, bishop of Jerusalem, makes
mention. And Peter in his first Epistle, where under the name of Babylon by a
figurative manor of speaking he understands Rome, has these words: The
congregation of them which at Babylon are companions of your eleccion, saluteth
you, and so does Mark my son. Wherefore he took the gospel that himself
had written, and went into Egypt, and first of all men preached Christ at
Alexandria, where he ordained a church or congregation of such pure doctrine
and perfect ly^ing, that he made all that professed Christ to follow his
example. To be short, Philo the eloquentest writer of the Jews, perceyuyng
the first congregation of Alexandria yet to persevere in the Iewishe religion,
wrote a book of their conversation, as it were in the praise of his nation: And
as Luke shows how all things were common among the beleuers at jerusalem,
so did he put in writing all that ever he saw done at Alexandria during the
time that Mark there taught and preached. He dyed in the eight year of Neros
reign, and was buried at Alexandria, in whose place succeeded Anianus.

The Paraphrase of Erasmus upon the Gospel of Saint Mark.
The first Chapter.
IT is naturallye given to all men, to desire felicity. This felicity many
worldly men right politic and wise, as touching a certain kind of wisdom,
have hitherto promised: some, by such laws as they have made and written:
other some, by rules and precepts that they have given, to teach men how to
lead a virtuous and a godly life. But for as much as they were me^ne, they
were not able to perform their promise. For they neither wi^t themselfes what
was the true, and perfyte felicity of man, nor wherein it stood. And for this
cause it came to pass, that instead of true felicity, they embraced a
certain deceyuable image or shadow thereof, and infected other with their
error, being both deceived them selfs, and deceyuers. Therefore both the
law makers, and philosophiers, brought us a certain gospel of their own
inuencion, but such a one as was partly false, and deceyuable, and partly
werishe and of no efficacy. Moses and the Prophets wrote a more certain and
piththie gospel than they, but to one nation alone: and as that time required,
wrapped with figures and shadows, disposing men only to ye knowleage of
verity, but insufficient to give perfect salvation, nevertheless sumwhat
promoting thereunto, wherein gods wisdom resembles nature, which brings
us, and as a man would say, leads us by the hand, from the knowleage of
things that are under our corporal sight, unto the knowleage of things
invisible. And yet their gospel contains in it more fear then glad and
joyful promise, and has much more bewrayed the wickedness of man, than taken
away the same, rather beaten into men's minds gods might and power, than
set out his mercy and goodness, caused more rather dread, then emplanted
love.

For what could man do but fear, tremble, and despair, after he had learned
by the law, that he was always in bondage and subieccion of sin, and not
able to refrain therfro, and also did know how no man could escape the
judgment of God, a very rigorous and sore auenger of sin and ungodliness?
Who is he that can find in his heart to love him whom he fears? Now ye
dread of gods justice, although it be many times the beginning of salvation,
even as a bitter medicine that vexes the whole body of man, is the entrey
to health, yet is it not the thing which makes man to have perfect felicity.
The grace and beneficial goodness of God, causes man to love God, and love to
godward is the thing that aua^^ceth him to happy state and felicity. Therefore
after ye whole world was sumwhat prepared, as well by the prophecies and
foresayinges of the prophets, as by the commandments and figures of Moses,
in these last days was opened and preached unto ye same, that very ioyefull
gospel, that all me^ne ought to embrace, and most lovingly to receive: which
of the own accord, or without any deseruyng on man's behalf, brings not
only to the Jews, but also to all nations of the world remission of all
sins. And lest happily any manne put doubts in ye certainty of this promise,
it is God that makes it, and no man: neither is his ambassador Moses, or
any of the Prophets, but the very son of God himself, Jesus Christ, who
for our salvation came down from heaven, and took upon him our corruptible
flesh, to the intent that he being giltlesse, and without all sin, might by
his passion and death, freely give innocence and life to all that believe his
promyses, and put their whole affiaunce in him.

For God, who is of his own proper nature gracious and beneficial, would by
this means, show that excedyng great and inestimable kindness that he bare
toward mankind: which was so great, that greater can neither be desired, ne
ought to be looked for. He could not send a more honorable messenger than his
own only begotten son, nor show more kyndnesse, than through faith only,
freely to release all men's offenses were they never so many, never so great
and heinous: yea and over this, through his holy spirit, chose those that were
before slaves and bondmen of the devil, to be fellows with his soonne, by
whom he has given us al things both in heaven and in earth.

And because nothing could be more joyful then this message, or tydinges, it
is by right good skyll called of the Greeks, Euangelion, that is as much to
say in English, as glad and joyful tidings, to comfort you, that you should
no more fear the yoke and burden of Moses law.

And albeit sum men had lever make a further rehersall of thistorye of the
gospel, and begin the same with the nativity and birth of Jesus Christ: Yet
me thinks it sufficient, for that I would be brief, to take my beginning of
John Baptistes preaching: For like as the day star goes before the Sun, so
came he, and appeared unto the world before Christ's preaching, not by chance
and fortune, but by Gods determinacion, to stir up the minds of the Jews,
to look for Messiah that would streightwayes cum, yea and to point him unto
them with his finger, when he came: the which John, the Prophets so many
hundred years sythens, prophesied and told before should cum. For the same
prophets which prophesied and spoke of Christ's cummyng, spoke and prophesied
also of John, the forewalker of Christ. For in Micheas the prophet, God the
father speaks unto his Son in this wise: Lo, says he: I send my
especial and elect messenger before thy face, who shall make a way for the,
that anon after shall cum, and take on the thoffice of preaching the gospel.
Likewise the Prophet Esaye sygnifying the preaching of John, says: The voice
of a cryar in wilderness: prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his
paths. In semblable wise the paciente is monished before the cummyng of the
Phisician, to knowlage his disease, and reverently to receive him when he
cummeth, and in all things to do after him, and follow his counsel. When
therefore the time approached, that Jesus Christ the son of God, who was not
yet known unto the world, should begin to take upon him this ministracion, for
the which he was sent down from heaven into earth, John according as the
Prophets had prophesied and told before, played the forecurrour, baptizing in
wilderness: not that he did thereby wash away sins, but only stir and
exhort men to be repentaunt for their former life, that they knowleaging their
disease should gredely desire his cumming which only baptizeth with spirit
and fire, taking away at once through faith in him, all sins: endowyng men's
souls with heavenly grace, which he pours out of himself, as out of the
well and fountain thereof: freely deliueryng from unrighteousness, freely
geuyng righteousness, freely deliueryng from death, and freely geuyng life
everlasting. The greater that this love and kinds was which God showed unto
mankind, the greuouser shall their punishment be that have set naught by
the same when it was offered them. And lest any should so do, John came before to
prepare and dispose all men by his carnal baptism, to the spiritual baptism
of Christ: to cause them by exhorting, and making them afraid, to forthinke,
and hate their former life: and finally to give them forewarnyng, that messiah,
and the kingdom of God, were at hand John was not the light that should
lighten every man, which cummeth into this world, but a messanger of the light
that anon after should appear. He was not the phisician which should take
away men's sins, and give health, but made them inwardly to tremble in
their conscience, in that he declared unto them the great danger they stood
in: Finally he styrred up all men's hearts, to the great desire of
everlasting salvation, by preaching unto them, how he was not far of, the
which only should deliver from sin. He was not ye brydgrome but a forewalker
of the bridegroom, to wake and call up all men, to meet the bride grome
cumming. He was not the son of God, but a voice foreshewing the son of God,
who anon after should be disclosed unto the world. Moses law was a fearful
law, in somuche that the childern of Israel could not abide the voice of God,
when he spoke unto them. John being a limitte or bordre set between the law
and grace, and as a man mengled of both, did herein use a point of the old
law, because in his preaching he manaced all men with everlasting death and
damnacion, unless they would turn in season from their sinful living. And
again this had he of the new, that he moved not the people to sacrifices,
burnt offringes, vows, or fastinges, but to baptism, and repentance of the
former life: and showed moreover how the most merciful Messiah was already
cum and present, who should freely forgive all men their offenses, that would
put their whole trust and confidence in him. The former law was written or
published in wilderness, and from thence also cummeth the beginning of the
new. He must clean forsake all the world, that will be worthy to be partaker
of the grace of the gospel, which compendiously gives all things. In great
cities are riches, delicacies pleasures, pride and ambicio^: But specially
Jerusalem had in it a famous temple, by reason whereof she was not a little proud
and stately. The same city had also carnal sacrifices whereunto the people
trusted. Furthermore it had holy days, obserua^ces of the sabbath, a
prescribed choice of meats, and other ceremonies, whereby she supposed that man
was justified and made rightuous before God: finally, there were high minded
priests, and dissemblyng pharisees. But who so desires the baptism of the
gospel must v^terly lay apart all trust and confidence of these things. He
must forsake all Iewry with her Jerusalem, her temple, her sacrifices, her
priesthod, and pharisaicall fashions, and from thence depart into wilderness
where he may hear the most joyful tydinges of our savior that straight
ways will cum. To return to John, he cried not in vain. For he made a great
many so afraid with his crying and preaching, that they forsook their dwelling
places, and hasted to the water of Jordan: and that not alonely out of all the
country of Iewrie, but also out of Jerusalem it self. Thither flocked a great
rablement of soldiers and publica^s, and also certain of the phariseis. John
received and taught as many as came, without choice or regard of person, and
did also baptize such of them as were displeased with themselfes for their
offenses, and confessed the same: expressing hereby as it were by a certain
corporal figure, the very order of the new law and gospel. For the first
office and ministry in christian profession is to teach. When ye christian
nouice (by this name understand good reader such a one as forsaking either
the Jewish or Panims religion, and intending to be christened, is newely
enstructed in the faith: in the wiche state he is called of thauncient fathers,
catechumenus) when I say, the christian nouice begins once through the
doctrine of the teacher both to know his own filthy living and also the
goodness of God, than is he wholely displeased with himself, and perceyuyng
no where else to appear any hope of salvation, has straight ways recourse for
aid and succor to the beneficial lord, who freely extends his mercy and
goodness toward us. It is a great furtheraunce to the recovering of health,
if the pacient know his own infirmity. It preuayleth not a little to the
obtaynyng of light, if a man perceive the present darkness he is in. He has
already much profited to purity of life and virtuous living, whosoever abhors
his own vnclenesse. The preaching of John, figureth the christian enstruccion,
or first teaching by mouth of Christ's religion. His baptism represents
the baptism of Christ. That he so gentlye received all that ever came unto
him, betokens nothing else, but like as every man needs the grace of the
gospel, even so no man of what degree or nation so ever he be, ought to be
secluded from the same. The phariseis had their wasshinges. They washed their
hands at meal time or when they should take their repaste: They washed their
bodies at their return home from the market: they washed oftymes their
cups, dishes, stools, tables, and the rest of their household stuf, as
though cleanesse and purity of life, which God loves, and allows in us,
stood in the obseruacion of such triefles, or as though a little quantity of
the Phariseis water, were of such force and virtue that it could make a man
ever the cleaner in the sight of almighty God. Such manner of washinges and
baptismes do not make a man cleaner in soul then he was before, but rather
more proud and arrogant. Happy therefore are they who have utterly forsaken
Moses, and the Phariseis washynges, and with all haste run unto the bathes of
Jordan. For in the Hebrew tongue this word (Jordan) is as much to say, as the
floude of judgment. He is not judged of the Lord, who so judges himself.
This is thatsame purifying floude which issues out of two fou^taynes, that
is, out of the knowleage of our own unrighteousness, and the remembrance of the
merciful goodness of god. This is that baptism of repentance, and flood of
tears, which causes streams of bitter water, to flow out of the most inward
veins of man's heart, but it has such strength and virtue, that it does as
it were with the sharpness of saltpeter, scower and wipe away all the spots
and filthe of the soul. The Phariseis also have a confession of their own,
but such an one as plainly declares their pride and arrogancy. I fast, says
the proud Pharisei, twyse in the weke. I give unto the poor the tenthe part
of all my goods, and I am not as other men be. The Jews confess other men's
sins, and not their own. Now they that prepare and make thems^lues ready to
receive the baptism of the gospel, will neither be known of their own good
deeds, nor make rehearsal of other men's faults, but each of them truly
confess their own. It is a point of arrogancy, for a man to stand in recital
of his own good deeds, even as to discover other men's offenses proceeds of
malice, and evil will. To be short, to acknowleage thine own sin and
iniquity, is to glorify the goodness of god.

And to the intent that John, who in like manier came before the first cummyng of
Christ, as Hely according to the prophecy of Malachi, shall cum before the
last, might the more in holy and perfect living resemble Hely, he led his life
in wilderness, utterly exchewing the sinful company of worldly people. He was
not clothed with silks nor yet with wullen clothes, but with a garment made of
Camels hear, and girded about the ^oynes with a lether gyrdle. And by this
straight manor of living, he showed a certain euangelike and christian
perfeccion, even before the gospel was published or preached. His food was
agreeable to his dwelling place, and apparayle. For it was even such as came to
hand, and was easy to be gotten: such as the place of the own accord, and
without husbanding or tillyng, gave him, most commonly certain flies, called
locustes, and wild honey. And here the criar or preacher of Christ, did a great
deal more then Moses law required. For that law made distinccion only between
sundry kinds of beasts. But he utterly, and that without commandment,
abstayned from eating of all four footed beasts, fowls, and fi^hes: That law
forfe^ded to were any clothing of linsaye wolsaye: but he clean deprived
himself both from the use of woll and flax. Such a life doubtless was
convenient for the preacher of repentance, who although he were sanctified in
his mothers womb, yet would he never the less lead a straight life, lest his
preaching should have been little esteemed and set by, if his living and
doctrine had in any point disagreed. And by this means he gate himself so
great renoume, and authority among the Jews, that many of them supposed he
had been very Messiah in deed. But John, albeit he was a man highly in the
favor of God, and endewed with many godly gifts and qualities, yet perceiving
what a great offense it was, for manne to challenge that glory which is dew
unto God, or for one man to put aid of salvation in an other, openly preached
in the presence of them all, and said: I am not he who^ ye suppose me to be.
My doctrine is a base and a werishe doctrine. My baptism is not effectual. I
am nothing else but a man as ye are, conceived in sin: nothing else but his
messenger, which will straight ways cum to give salvation unto all men.

He is behynd me in time, and after the estimacion of the world, of much less
authority then I am: but he surmounteth me so far in heavenly power, that I,
He that is stronger the^ I, etc,
whom you have in such reverence and veneracion, am not worthy to serve him in
the office of the vilest drudge or slave: not worthy, I say, to lie upon the
ground, and vnleuse the latchet of his shors. You ought to honor him. You
ought intierly, and with most fervent affeccion, to desire his cummyng. I
preach unto you earthly things. He shall teach you heavenly matiers. I have
hitherto baptized you, as touching the body, with water, preparing your minds
to repentance: When he ^nce cummeth abroad, he shall baptize you with the holy
ghost, whose secret virtue sanctifies all things. For as no man has
righteousness of himself, even so can no man give the same to an other. He
must needs be of more power and excellency than man, whosoever gives that thing,
which pertayneth to God alone to give. Know you the difference between an
unworthy servant, and the master: between the minister, and the auctor:
between the criar, and the king.

After that John had with words of like sentence, moved and styrred up the
mind of a great many of them, to wayt for Messiah that was cummyng, then
forth came Jesus when his time was cum, forsakyng the little village of Nazareth
in the country of Galile, where because of his educacio^ and long continuance
in the same, men thought he had been borne. Certes this is the nature and
property of all euangelike things, to begin very baselye, and from such
begynnynges by little and little, to cum at the length to highest perfeccion:
whereas contrarily all things that ever the world and the deuel goes about
are after merueilous goodly beginninges, suddenly cast down, and brought to
naught. So lucifer whiles he set his feate in the north ymagenyng to be equal
with the highest, was sodainlye cast down headlyng into hell. In semblable
wise Adam when that thorough the devils instigacio^, he desired to be equal
with God, was by and by exiled, and cast out of paradise. Therefore if thou here
considre the high excellency, and greatness of Jesus, it will cause the much
more to wonder at his singular humbleness of mind and modesty. He came out of
a poor and homely village, out of Galile the vil^st country of all Iewrie. He
that purifieth all things, came as one of the rascal sort, humble and lowly
to the baptism of repentance, among sinners, soldiers, brothelles, and
publica^s without any servants to wait and atte^de upon him. It was not
enough for him to be circumcised according to the ordinance of the law, and
purified after the tradicion of Moses: He desired also to receive John's
baptism, teaching and enstructing us hereby, that whosoever makes him self ready
to be a ministre and preacher of the gospel, must omit nothing which in
any wise perteyneth to the increase of virtue and godliness: And again ^schew
all things, wherewith the weakelinges may be offended. John taught us this
lesson, that a preacher of gods word should, not get himself estimacion and
authority, by gorgeous apparel, or po^pouse living, but by honest behavior,
and godly conuersacio^. But the e^sa^ple that Christ showed, was of much more
perfeccion, and farther from the Iewishe fashion then this: for that he
differyng nothing at all from other, neither in his apparel, nor yet in diet,
did nevertheless by his godly lyning, meekness, and beneficial goodness
toward all men, utterly duske and deface the authority of John. For that is
of higher perfeccion which is given by the grace of the gospel, then that
which proceeds from the austeritie, and straitnes of the law. The whole
intent of the lord Jesus was this, to make the world to know how he was the
only aucthour of salvation, to express and set out unto us, a certain form
of euangelike and true godlynes, to confirm the truth and certentie of all
that ever Moses and the Prophets had v^^itte^ of things past, and to make
us, as it were with the giving of an earnest penny, to have a sure hope and
expectacion of things yet to come. For we right gladly believe him, of whom we
have conceived a marvelous good opinion, and upon whom many witnesses do
consent and agree.

Wherefore it was procured by the providence and wisdom of god, that the Lord
Jesus should every where have an evident record and testimony of his deity:
Of the whole law of Moses, of all the Prophets, of the angels, of the
shepardes, of the wise men called Magicians, of the Scribes, of Simeon and
Anne, of John baptist, of the father, of the holy ghost, and finally of Pylate,
and the devils. The miracles also that he wrought, plainly declared him to be
ye son of God. He did many things, not because himself had any need so to
do, but for yt he would set out unto us in his own person, a certain form
and trade of living: as when he fasted, when he was tempted, when he oftentimes
prayed, when he came to baptism, when he obeyed his parents, when he
patiently suffered all injuries and wrongs, and finallye when he came to his
cross and passion.

He performed many things that the prophets had prophesied of before, lest
the people should doubt of the promises afterward to be accomplished: as when
that in his baptism he received the holy ghost in the likeness of a dove,
lightyng upon the croune of his head: as when he arose again from death to
life. Wherefore he came as a penitent to John: he desired his baptism, and
obtained it. He was baptized in Iordane, wherein were baptized both tanners,
Publicans, and soldiers, a sort of people so sinful, that none are more
blemished or defiled w^^h sin. Are not here ye stately princes of this world
ashamed, who will have nothing common with the vulgar people? No king, nor
priest cummeth to baptism, and if it were their pleasure so to do, they would
scarcely vouchesafe to receive baptism in a basin of gold or preciouse
stones. Now our savior Jesus, that fountain of all purity, that king of all
kings, that lord of all lords, disdayned not the common bathe, wherein the
common sort were washed. But whosoever humbles himself before man, And as soon as
he was come. etc.
the same is highly exalted before god. Jesus was baptized as the rest, and
euerychone of the common people there present. But the father of heaven
disseuered him from the residue, by a certain notable sign never seen, ne
heard of before. For as soon as he was come out of the water of Iordane (which
he hallowed with the touch of his holy body) unto land, as he was in his
contemplacion and prayers, John saw the heavens open, and the holy ghost fly
down from thence, and light upon the holy croune of his head, and there
tarry. The pride of Adam closed the gates of paradise against us: The
humbleness of mind and modesty of Christ, has for paradise opened us the
gates of Heaven. There was a visible sign showed unto man's iyes, but by the
same we were taught what manner of minds that heavenly spirit both loves
and makes. The spirit of the devil, and the world makes and loves such
minds as are haute, puffed up with pride, and fierce: but that heavenly
spirit loves those which are lowely, meke, and peacible. There is nothing
more harmles, and more without gyle, then the dove: nothing whose nature wurse
agrees with fighting and raueny. It was plainlye expressed and set out in the
lord by this corporal figure, what is spiritually wrought in all those that
with a sincere and pure faith, receive the baptism of the gospel. The body is
washed with water, but the soul is thoroughly anointed with grace invisible.
Moreover that the done abode still upon the croune of the lords head,
signified that the holy ghost is given to all other godly men, and good
lyuers, ^atably after the measure and proporcion of their faith, as it is
presently expedient. But in Jesus was the continual fountain of al heavenly
grace. For the dove brought him not then any new grace which he had not
before, but evidently declared how he was full of grace, and showed moreover,
from whence all grace and goodness issues, and cummeth unto us. John being
stablyshed in mind with this so evident a sign received of the father of
heaven, And there ^a^e a voice from heaven etc.
doubted not to pronounce Jesus to be the very son of God. The witness that he
gave unto Christ, was of great weight and authority among the Jews, but much
greater was the testimony of the father himself: whose voice sounded down
from the heavens, saying: Thou art that my derely beloved son, in whom my
mind delights. For a wise child is the fathers joy and comfort. That
heavenly spirit of God is not idle, weak, faint or feeble, but of nature all
fiery, and by and by wurketh, and puts forth his virtue, as soon as it is
once entered into the soul of man.

The spirit of man is slack and slow, and thinks upon nothing, but that
which is low, vile, and worldly. But they that have the spirit of the fleash
mortified, and are led with the spirit of God, do furthwith go in hand with
high things, and of manly enterprise, that is to say, do fight against the
unclean spirit, their ghostly enemy the devil, who^ they are not afraid even
to provoke to battle, as men puttyng their whole confidence in the aid and
succor of the heavenly spirit, which is of much more virtue and puissau^ce
than all that withstand the gospel.

Wherefore Jesus plainly expressing in himself, what he would have us to do
incontinent after we have received baptism, was brought by force of the holy
ghost, into wilderness. There he made his abode fowertie days, and as many
nyghtes, still continuyng in prayer and fasting, and in the mean season he was
tempted of the devil, whom (after he had discoumfited, and overthrown him) he
delivered unto us to ouercum: showing us also the very way and mean, how to
get the victory. He is overthrown by the spirit of Christ, by continual
prayer, and soberness of life, and by the weapon of holy Scripture. The while
that Christ continued thus in wilderness, he lived among saluage beasts,
utterly abstayning from all comfort and solace taken of the company of man.
There had been no danger for him if he had been conuersaunt with the multitude
of people, but he showed hereby how expedient it is for a Christian soldier,
to exchewe the compainye of the conmon sort, until he have sufficiently tamed
the flesh, and overcome the devil, and by continual recordyng of Gods law,
and devout prayers, made him self strong enough in spirit. For many be in
more safety when they live among beasts as Christ did, then when they be
conuersaunt with such me^ne as are more noisome then any brute beasts. The
Lord and savior Jesus Christ kept company with beasts: but whiles he lacked
the ministry of me^, Angels were always present, and served him. They that
utterly despise al^ the pastimes and pleasures of this world, never want
heavenly pleasures, and solaces. For us and our profit Christ was baptized:
For us he prayed: for us he was notably described by the testimony of the
father, and the holy ghost: for us he went into wilderness: for us he fasted:
for us he was tempted: for us he gatte the victory over the devil. Here
consider thou Christian soldier, the very true and right order of thy
perfeccion. The first instruccion and teaching by mouth of Christ's religion,
causes hatred of the former life, and hope of clensyng or remission of sins.
With these capitaines thou runnest to Iordane: and there through faith in
Christ, washest away the fylthynesse of all thy sins. And anon after at
thine own prayer and at the peti^ion and prayer of the church, thou have a
new spirit given the from heaven, and by it art admitted to be of the number
of the children of God, and empla^ted into the body of Jesus Christ, as a member
of him, who is the very head of the church. In the mean while it behooves
not the soldier of Christ, to be careless. Thou have promised thy service
to Christ thine Emperor. Thou have renounced the devil. Thou haste received
the holy ghost as it were gift money, a bond, and an earnest penye of thy
salarye. Thou must enforce thyselfe with thy utter endeavor to get victory. But
that never chau^ceth to the negligente and rechele^^e person. Thou must take to
thee armoure and weapon, lest thine ennemie which euerywhere lies in wait
for the, cum upon the vnwa^es, and when thou art unarmed. Thou shalt
incontinent be assaulted with the world, the devil, and the flesh. Thou must
always fight, to thentent thou may always get victory. For this battle
shall not ^nde before thou make an end of thy life. But yet the oftener thou
chance to vanquishe thine enemy, the weaker shall he depart from battle,
and thou the stronger. When thou haste here behaved thyselfe valiantly, and
played the manne a while, then at the length address thy self to the
ministracion of the gospel, specially if thou feel that the spirit of God
drive the thereunto.

The Lord Jesus was meet to preach the gospel (then which ministry,
there is none of greater perfeccion) even when he was a very little ^hylde: But
he ordained a patarne or an example in himself, for us to counterfayte and
follow: whereby we are taught, that we ought not by and by after our profession,
rashely to hasten ourselves to this so high and holy a ministracion. The law
of Moses had her time. There was also a time when it behooved that as the light
of the euangelyke verity, began by little and little to shine forth unto the
world: even so should the shadows of the old law vanishe away: and the
carnal law give place unto the spiritual, puttyng forth her virtue. Like as
in transformacions and natural chaungynges of things, there is a certain
mean, which has some affinity with both the extremes, to the intent that
things of much contrariety may easily be tra^sformed, and to ^rned one into
another: Eu^n so John came as a mean between the carnal law of Moses, and
the spiritual law of ye gospel, to this end, that men might the sooner be
transformed, and brought from the flesh or litterall sense of the law, to the
spirit, and true meaning of the same. For air is not suddenly, and immediately
made of earth, but in this transformacion water is the mean between both,
which at the length by little and little is fined into air, a more pure
element. Wherefore as long as the preaching of John (who partly vphelde the old
law, for as much as it also sumwhat helps to bring a man to Christ)
floris^ed, our savior Jesus, lest he should have seemed to any, either to
contend with John, or else to disanull the law, which he came to make perfect,
never preached openly, ne declared his divine power, but with a few miracles,
nor gathered together any disciples, but rather behaved himself as the
disciple of John: teaching us hereby, that no man can well exercise the office
of a master, unless himself have been before an obedient disciple. But
after that John was cast into prison for his plain and fra^ke speaking, then
did Christ as it were succeed him, and come in his place. It is meet that the
carnal be first, and that latermore, which is spiritual and gostely. That
which is imperfect goes before, and the perfect cummeth after. Grace follows
the property of Nature. Corn is first grass before it have eeres, and
man's state follows after infancy. The ceremonies of the law,
notwitstandyng they have sumwhat shadowed and figured Christ, yet now at the
length draw they to their end, and the light of the gospel shines abroad,
whose only auctour is Jesus Christ. He went first to preach in Galile. For it
lyked him that this new light should begin to shine out of that part of
Iewry, which was counted vilest of all other. Proud Jerusalem deserved not to
have this pre^minence, which, albeit she were in very deed as blind as a
betell, yet thought her self to have a perfect good sight, and for that cause
was more incurable.

But in these things, which came not to pass by hasard of Fortune, there
lies hyd a certain secret significacio^ of things to be done. For what
be^^keneth it that John is closed and shut up in prison? Forsooth that the law
of Moses shall at the appearyng of the most clear light of the Gospel, be
made dark, and utterly loose her light. What signifies it that he is bound?
Truly that the carnal part of the law shall be bound, and freedom l^used
and set at large, through the grace of the gospel. What means it that John's
head is stricken of? Certes that now is present the true head of the whole
congregation, which shall be assembled of all nations of the whole world.

What is this that Jesus preaches the kingdom of God in Galile? Undoubtedlye
he makes a foresigne that the grace of the gospel shall forsake the wicked
Jews, and go from them to the Gentyles, because the Jews embraced still that
old head which was chopped of by the gospel, and contemned Christ the
very head of the whole law. For this word (Galile) in the Sirian tongue,
signifies a flytting or chaungyng of habitacion. Before time grace lay hid,
and ceremonies were in highest estimacion. Now are they gone, and Jesus
cummeth abroad, the effectual auctour and preacher of the grace of the
gospel. Therefore according to the mystical sense hereof, whosoever will hear
Christ preach, must flytte away from their old vsages, and naughty lusts, to
the intent they may be receyuable of this new and heavenly doctrine. Let the
Jew cast away the persuasion and sure belief he has conceived of his own
holiness: the Pharisey, the pride he takes by trustyng to his works: the
Bishops, the glory of their temple, and sacrifices: the Philosophers, the
vain aids of man's wisdom. Let Kings and tyrauntes cast away that most
foolyshe trust, which they repose in their riches. Let all nations lay
aparte all ungodly customs, all filthy lusts, and hearken unto this new
Preacher Jesus, who teaches not worldly, but heavenly things. He speaks
indifferently to all men. Let all men therefore hear him alike.

Here is it very expediente to consider how our savior Christ begins to set
forth his doctrine. Worldly Philosophers do first teach their audience, nor
those things which are most fruitful and profitable, but such things as may
cause the^ to be had in admiracio^ for their singular wisdom, minding nothing
so much, as to get themselves a name by dissenting in opinion, from other
famous teachers. But the lord Jesus would neither disanull thauctoritie of
the old law, (for he does truly interpret ye same, which was before miss
understand: rather making it perfect, the^ destroying it) neither disproued he
John's doctrine, although it were imperfect, but began his preaching with the
selfsame beginning, which John had used before. A man would have said he had
been the very scholar and disciple of John, who was in deed the master, and
auctour of all. Now what preaches he? what is the cry that ye word, and son
of the everlasting father makes? The world had far swarued from ye right usage
of the law of nature, which God has graven and planted in all men's hertes. The
wisdom that the philosophers taught, increased the folly of the world. The
religion which the gentyles used before time, was most wicked, and detestable.
The law of Moses caused much hipocrisy with her shadows, her sacrifices, and
her fears. The law sygnified or meant by her figures, and the Prophets told
before by their prophecies, how one should cum, who should offer unto all
nations perfect salvation. But because this promise was so long differred, the
world being as it were deaf, gave no ear thereunto at all. Yet the lord of
his graciouse goodness, forgate not to perform the same. Now is the time
already fulfilled that he prefixed or aforepointed unto this business. You need
not from henceforth to await for the fulfillyng of any other figures, or any mo
dark sayings of ye law. You need not to look after new prophets. Lo, the
kingdom of God is now present. In stead of shadows ^eritie shall shine
abroad. In stead of the carnal law, the spiritual shall succeed and cum in
place. In stead of corporal ceremonies, true godliness shall reign. In stead
of the deuilles kingdom, Gods kingdom shall be enlarged. There is no cause why
you should linger or stay: why any man should look back unto the aids of
his own righteousness.

Perhaps as Moses law takes righteousness, sum are rightuouse in the sight
of the world: but as the new law requires the same, all men are sinners, and
unrighteous. Yet for all that there is no cause why you should despair. Know
your disease, and then receive remedy, that is, only be you repentaunte for
your former life, and steadfastly believe the gospel. Now is there brought unto
you a message right joyful, and much to be desired, I mean free remission of
all your trespasses. You have no need of burnte offringes. Only* knowledge
your unrighteousness, and repose your affiaunce in the righteousness of
almighty god, who doubtless will perform what he promises by his gospel.
For that man shall sufficiently deserve to enjoy the promise thereof, whosoever
believes the promiser.

After the Lord Jesus had with such words moved and styrred up the minds of
the Jews to receive the new Philosophy, and doctrine of the gospel, he
likewise began after the ensample of John to gather certain disciples, but
few in number, and such as were unlettered persons, and of low degree, to
the intent that when he had through their ministry converted all the whole
world, it should plainly appear how this kingdom was the very kingdom of
God, and not a worldly kingdom. Therefore as he trauayled on a day by the lake
or sea of Galile, he ispied Simon, and Andrewe his brother, labouryng together,
and about to cast their nets into the water: For they were fishermen, and
by this occupacion gat their living. The baseness of their craft, made for the
aduauncyng of gods glory. The concord of the two brethren, sygnified the
consent and agremente of the church. The craft of fyshing, bare the figure of
the ministracio^ of the gospel, which by virtue of Gods word plucketh up
into the light of verity, and love of heavenly things, such as are drowned
in the darkness of ignorance, and the foul stinkyng puddell of worldly
cares. And thus first of all fyshed he for these two fyshers. Come ye (quod
he) and follow me, for I will make you begin from this day forward, to fyshe
after men. As Soon as the Lord Jesus had spoken the word, the two brethren
leaving their nets even as they were, followed him without any tarying. For
Jesus voice has in it a certain heavenly charm or inchauntment. And going
thence a little forward, he saw other two, that is to were, James the son of
zebede, and John his brother, who were also trymmyng and mendyng their nets
in the ship, and making themselves ready to go a fyshyng. And these two
notwithstanding their minds were bent another way, he sodeinly spoke unto,
calling and commaundyng the^ to follow him. Now, that thou may know young men
of an euangelike faith, they made no tarying, but leauyng their father zebede
with his hired servants in the ship, straight ways followed their caller.
Thus began Christ to gather the ciefe prelates, and ministers of his
Church, clean refusyng the priests, and Phariseis of Jerusalem, with all
their pomp and pride.

And being accompanied with such a fellowship, he came unto Capernaum. This
Capernaum was a city much florishyng in substance, but no less proud,
ungodly, and vicious, than it was welthy. Here byanby he began to play the
part of an Euangeliste, or preacher of the gospel.

For upon the sabbath day he entered into the Sinagoge, and taught the Jews
openly, not the vain fables of the Phariseis, but declared unto them the very
true meaning of the law, which was in deed spiritual, and not carnal. And
the people perceived him to be a new teacher, and his doctrine also to be of a
new sort. They saw he was a man of low degree, and that such as accompanied
him were but few in number, very rascals, and men of no reputacion: yet
wondered they greatly at his words, for that they breathed a certain godly
virtue. For he did not after the manner of the Scribes, teach triflyng
co^stitucions of men, or old wives tales of genealogies, and pedegrewes, but
his words were pith^hy and of authority, and the wonderful great miracles he
wrought, caused those verities that he spoke to be believed. What thing soever
is humayne and worldly, the same is of little price and estimacion, when Gods
power begins once to put forth his strength and efficacy.

And lo, byanby there was occasion ministered for him to work a miracle. For in
that assembly, was there a certain fellow which was vexed with an unclean
spirit. This wicked spirit could not abide the heavenly spirit speaking in
Christ. For he began to clatter against his heavenly doctrine, crying aloude,
and saying: O Jesus of Nazareth, what have thou to do with us? Art thou cumme
to destroy us before the time? I right well know who thou art. Certes the
self same holy one, which the prophet Daniel promised long since, whom God
has singularly sanctified above al other. The lord Jesus, either because the
time was not yet cumme that he should openly confess who he was, or else
because he was not pleased with this confession, being undoubtedly true, but
yet made ^hroughe constraint of fear, and of a wicked spirit (who sithe he is
of himself a liar, and delights to deceive man, was not to be heard in the
presence of the people when he spoke the truth, lest any manne would have
taken occasion there by to believe him afterward when he had lied,) the lord
Jesus, I say, rebuked him, and said: Hold thy peace, and depart out of the
man, and so shall thou better declare who I am. And furthwith at the lords
commandment, the unclean spirit forsook the man. But at his departure he
tare him, and cried out with a loud voice, so that it evidently appeared
thereby, how he fled away not wyllingly, but by force and constraint of Gods
power. And here was showed the figure of a man possessed with the spirit of
the devil. Is not he vexed with the worste, and cruellest of all the devils,
which is wholly possessed with ambicion, covetousness, rancour, malice, hatred,
pleasure of the body, and such other like deuilishe lusts, and appetites?
Such as are vexed with these spirits, can in no wise abide to hear the
gospel preached, but yell and cry out against it, as the devil did, saying:
what haste thou to do with us Jesus? Art thou cumme to destroy us? For so
many as ye spirit of this world possesses, think themselves utterly
forlorn, whenever they are constrained to forsake those things wherein they
have set their false felicity. Wherefore their minds are sore troubled, and
as you would say, tugged and haled into sondrie pieces, whylest on the one
side fear of eternal damnacion moves them to virtue and goodness, on the
other side the venimous^ swetnes of such vices as they have of long time
accustomed unto, holds them fast and withdraws them from their godly
purpose.

But yet no manner of devil takes so fast hold, but he will at the
commandment of Jesus, fly away. It is a much greater miracle to make of an
ambicious man, a temperate, of a fyerce fellow, a pacient, of the lecherous
person, a chaste liver, of the extorcioner or one that lives by pollyng and
pyllyng, a lyberall man, than to deliver a man's body from a wicked spirit.

But yet men wonder more at this, then at the other, not because it is more
wonderful and marvelous in deed, but for that it is seen with bodily iyes.
Therefore when he had thus chased away the unclean spirit by commandment
only, And they were all amassed. etc.
then the Jews greatly wondered at it, insomuche that they demanded one of
another saying: What new thing is this? we have not read that ever the
Prophets did the like, castyng out deuyls by bare word of mouth only. Or
what new kind of doctrine is this, that has so great virtue and power
following it? He preaches the kingdom of god, and puts furthe Gods power,
in that he treads under foot, and subdueth the power of the devil. Neither
is it by sorcery or inchauntment, or by making of long prayers unto god, nor
yet by any other laborious mean that he thus puts to flight the wicked
fendes: But he commands them with word only as their lord and conqueror,
and they incontine^t whether they will or no, obey him. Of this wonderful
fact, a great fame of Jesus was spread abroad throughout all the country of
Galile. And because it should appear that in him is the well spring of godly
power, which can never be consumed, one miracle did straight ways succeed and
follow another.

For anon as they were departed out of the synagoge, they came into the house
of Symo^ and Andrew, whither also James and John followed. Now Symons mother in
law, as it the^ fortuned, lay sick and was sore vexed with an ague. As Soon
as Jesus was by them advertised thereof, he went to the bedside and took the
woman by the hand, and lyfted her up, and forthwith the fever forsook her, and
eue^ as she was suddenly, so was she perfectly, made whole. For she was
suddenly made as lusty and strong, as she was before, insomuche that she did
her accustomed office in the house, ministering unto Jesus, and his disciples.

He lies sick of a perilous disease, whose mind burns with the love of
carnal pleasures: who by reason of superfluity and excess, leads an idle
and a sluggishe life. It is a woman that lies sick. And at the beginning the
first woman deceived with the pleasant alurement of an apple, began to be
sick of this ague. Our flesh that always lusts against the spirit is our
Eve. But happy are they whom Jesus, with the touch of his most holy
spirit, lifts up to the love of heavenly things, that he which before time
served idleness, riotous living, and uncleanness, may suddenly recover his
old strength, and lustynes, and being made a new manne, hereafter becum the
servant of clennes, chastity, and sobernes. For these are the meats, which
Christ is refreshed, and delyghted withal. Now ymagine, that the house of
Simon sygnifieth the church of Christ, in the which it is not convenient that
there be any feeble and weak in spirit, but such as are full of euangelyke
strength, and lustines. And yet many times Peter's mother in law, that is to
say, the synagoge, lies sick in the same. For he is a membre of the
synagoge, unto whose corrupt tasting, the unsavory and weryshe letter yet
sauoreth: who tastes well the water of the Pharisaicall understanding, and can
in no wise taste the wine of the spirit, and true meaning of the gospel.

They that were in the house with the Lord Jesus, desired him to lift up the
woman that lay sick in her bed. In semblable wise let us all, who are
me^bres of the church, desire his merciful goodness with most humble prayers,
that he will vouchesafe to put out his holy right hand, and therewith to lift
up also those timorous persons, which clening only to the letter of scripture,
and wholly given to the supersticious obseruacion of ceremonies, do of a
certain unright judgment, greatly desire those things that are hurtful and
noisome: and contrarily, hate and abhor such things as are only to be
desired: to lift them up, I say, to the fredome of the gospel, which
serves not for this purpose that we should with more liberty commit sin
at pleasure, but to the intent we should gladly, and with right good will, do
the works of Euangelike or christian charity, and cherishe Jesus in his
members. The Lord is always ready to heal the soul, if he be desired, and
called upon. He loves those that call upon him, call they never so
importunatly, and out of season.

It was now late in the evening, and the sun was set, so that it might be
thought a great point of importunitee, to call upon the physycian at that time.
But the great desire of health had the upper hand of shame. They brought unto
him a very great number of such as were diseased with all kinds of
infirmities, and among them also, some which were vexed with unclean
spirits. The whole city of Capernaum came thick and threfolde, to the gate
of the house to see this sight. Jesus without excuse healed very many of them,
of sundry diseases, and cast out many devils. He was a quick and a ready
physycian, who with word cured diseases. Moreover he put to silence the
devils, who cried with a loud voice that he was Christ, utterly despysyng the
testimony of his enemies, and of them with whom he would that his should in
no wise have to do. He suffered the children of the Hebrews, and fyshers, to
descry him: But he admitted no record of the devils, though it were true. The
noughtines of the person that tells the truth, does hurt the same. And he
does more harm with his lies, which has gotten himself credence before by
some true tale tellyng. This was then done according to the history. But to
open the secret sense and meaning hereof. We se very many even now adays,
that cum flockyng unto Simon Peter's house: which as I said before, bare the
figure of the Church. For the city of Capernaum represents the whole world:
the setting of the sun, fygureth the death of Christ. The gate of the
house, signifies baptism, which is beset with repentance of the former
life, and trust to obtain soul health of Jesus. The sick people sit
about the gates, that is to say, the Publicans and sinners desire to be
received into the fellowship of the church. They should not deserve to behealed
except they surely believed that Jesus both could and would give them health.
The church of Christ contained in it but a very small number, so long as he y^
lantern and light of the world, lived in earth. But after his death a great
multitude of people began thither to resort, out of all the countries of the
world.

These things so done: when the Lord Jesus who came not for this only
purpose to cure corporal diseases, which he sends many times to his to the
intent they may be whole in soul: when, I say, he saw the multitude greatly
desire to be healed of their bodily diseases, and not with like affeccion covet
to hear his heavenly doctrine, wherewith the maladies and diseases of the
soul are cured, the next day, as though he had been desirous to take some
ease and rest, he deceived them, for he roose very earlye in the morning, and
went from Capernaum into a solytary place, where he made his prayers to the
father, genyng him thanks for the benefits wyche he had decreed to give unto
mankind by him. And here are sundry ensamples prepared for our instruccion.
First he teaches us that we must as soon as we have done our neighbor good,
depart away: lest we seem to look after any mede or reward, of those that we
have done good unto. Secondarilye we are taught many times to leave of the
teaching of holsom doctrine for a season to styre up a desire in us to advance
the same. Finally we learn also that we ought to refreshe and quicken the
spirit, by often going aside into solitary places: I mean not such goynges
aparte, as are for pleasure and pastime, but for prayer, and heavenly
contemplacion: because we may return from thence more willing in spirit,
and better disposed to help the weak: Every man which has changed place, is
not goen into wilderness, but he that has clean severed his mind from worldly
cares, and wholly bent himself to the study, and contemplacion of heavenly
things. When Simon Peter, and the rest of the disciples understood that Jesus
was priuilye departed, they followed after til they had found where he was. For
it is not beseming that the true disciples of Jesus be any time away from their
master whom they ought in all things to follow. In the mean season, when the
people, which flocked early in the morning to the gate of the house, had also
learned how Jesus was gone away, they likewise followed him into the
wilderness. Many there be that follow Jesus, but none find him out save
alonly his disciples: who after they have once found him, do show him unto
other.

Wherefore they told the lord, how there was a great multitude of the citizens
of Capernaum come thither to seek him. The lord then answered again saying. It
is sufficient at this present, to have laid these foundacions among the
Capernaites. Now it is time for me to go in like manner, and viset the little
tounes, and villages here about, that I may likewise there preach the
kingdom of god* For I came not to preach to one city alone, but to declare
salvation to all men. For this cause the Lord trauayled through the tounes,
and villages of all Galilee preaching in their Synagoges, curyng diseases, and
castyng out devils, because the ignorant people should by reason of his mighty
deeds and miracles, give firm credence unto his doctrine.

It chanced on a time when Jesus had taught the people in a certain mountain
many goodly lessons, concerning the perfeccion of the euangelike or christian
profession, that there met him as he came down again, a certain man infected
with leprosy, a disease incurable, and abhorred of all men: in whom was showed
to the corporal iyes, a figure of those things which he wrought by invisible
operacion in the souls of the hearers. The leper hated his filthy disease, and
had a marvelous great confidence in Jesus. Here thou see a figure of a sinner,
which returnyng from vicious living, and entendyng to amend, is at the next
door to salvation. The same leper feared not ye people although he knew right
well that they abhorred his company, but only regarded the goodness of Jesus.
Wherefore he ran unto him, and fell down at his knees. What would the proud
Pharisey here do? He would cry: hence with this ougly and abominable
creature, lest he infect even our very iyes. He would call for water to wash
away his noisome, and contagious breath.

This would the Pharisey do, more unclean in soul, then any leper in body.
But what does the most meke and gentill Lord, which only was pure and clean
from all spot of sin? He commands him not to be had out of his sight, nor
to be removed away from his knees. It was not unknown unto him what he
desired: but his will was yt the notable faith of this man, should be an
ensample to all men. All such as be lecherous persons, covetous, full of
hatred and envy, or attached with other filthy lusts and appetites of the
body, are foul arrayed with this horrible and detestable leprosy. And such as
are herewith infected, let them hear, and mark the words of this leper, to
the intent they may follow him. If thou will, says he, thou canste make me
clean. He knowlegeth his disease, and doubts not of the power, and goodness
of God. He wholly referrreth ye judgment to the lord, to judge of him whether
he be worthy to receive so great a benefit at his hands, or no: ready to
give thanks if he obtain his desire: and not to murmur, and grutche against
him, if he obtain it not. For he would say thus: He is able to put away
leprosy, who not only cures all kinds of diseases, but also casts out
devils: and he will do it, that so willingly helps all that are in distress
and misery, whersoeuer he cummeth. But so great is mine unworthiness, that I
alone deserve not that, which all other obtain of his most merciful goodness.
This so perfect a belefe, joined with exceeding humblenes of mind, and
modesty, procured him mercy of Jesus. For our savior showing outwardlye, even
with his countenance, a certain affecte of pity and compassion, thereby to
teach what affeccion of mind ought to be in us toward sinners, heldeout his
hand, and therewith touched the leaper, And Jesus had compassion on him etc.
and by virtue of words that himself prescribed, made him clean. The leper
said: If thou will thou can make me clean. Jesus answered: I will, be thou
clean. True faith makes not many words, neither grutcheth the charity of
the gospel to do a good deed. And Christ had scarcely spoken these words (be
clean) but the disease was quite gone from the man, so that no token thereof
remained. The law of Moses forfendeth to touch a leaper, the spiritual
meaning whereof, co^tayneth wholesome doctrine. We must abstain from the company
of unclean persons and sinners, lest we be infected by the contagiousenes of
their vices. But the Lord Jesus is above the law: neither can he be defiled
with touching, who purifieth whatsoever he touches. He touched the leaper with
his hand, and furthwith he healed his whole body. Let us therefore pray that
he may in se^blable wise touch our souls with his holy word, and therewith
purify our inward uncleanness. O thou that use to haunt the company of
harlots, thou that (...) an adulterer, or polluted with like diseases, run in
like manner unto Jesus (for he cu^meth down from the height of his majesty
and meteth the) and knowing thine own filthiness, fall down at his knees,
prostrate thy self, and lie flat upon the ground: Cry and call upon him, but
cry with most steadfast belife of heart and mind: Lord, if thou will, thou
canste make me clean. And anon thou shall hear these words again of thy
merciful savior: I will, be thou clean. After these things were done in
manner before rehearsed, the Lord suffered not the man to follow him, but
caused him to depart, commanding him straytly to disclose nothing of this
matter to any creature living, but rather (quod he) get the hence, and show thy
self to the priest, by whose judgment according to the ceremonies of the law
thou wast judged to be a leaper. And if he give sentence that thou art cleansed
in deed of thy leprosy, then offer that Moses has commanded to be offered, of
those that should fortune to be delivered thereof. Thus shall thou with more
crede^ce publishe gods benefit toward the, the^ if thou straight ways tell
every body that thou art made clean. For by this means it shall appear,
even unto the Phariseis themselves, which deprave my benefits, that thou wast
a very leper, and have been cleansed without either help of the Phisicia^s, or
else of Moses law, by bare word of mouth, and touch only: and so shall they
know how there is one present that far passes their priests: who can easily
cure leprosy, though it be detestable, and abhorted, where as they have much a
do, truly to dicerne the same. This fellow departed, instead of a leper clean
in body, and went to the priest, and was seen, and judged to be cleansed of
all leprosy. And anon after he conceled not this deed, but published it
euerywhere, reportyng both this, and many other things of Jesus. Sum will here
ask: Why did this man as he was commanded in the one thing, and in the other,
nothing regard the Lords commandment? Truly for that the one served to
confirm the certainty of the miracle, because the priest not knowing as yet
who had healed the man, should pronounce his health restored by Jesus, to be a
perfect health, who else peradventure would have depraved Christ's benefit, if
the autour thereof had been known, before he had given his verdite. But after
the miracle was once confirmed by his sentence, then made it much for Gods
glory to have it published abroad. Wherefore then commanded Jesus that thing to
be kept secret, which in deed his will was should be blased abroad and vttred?
Forsooth to monishe us that we ought to seek no glory and praise of man for the
benefits which it pleases God to work by us, because the goodlyer praise
ever follows them which refuse the same. It proceeds of an high courage so to
do a good turn, yt thou would have no thanks therefore yelden the of him,
whom thou have done good and pleasure unto, being only contented with this,
that it lay in thy lot to help thine even Christen in his necessity. But he
that is helped by such benefit as he has received at thy hands, ought with
so much the more diligence to publish and set out thy well doing euerywhere to
thy praise and co^mendacion. Christ was in no danger to offend in vainglory:
and therefore this ensample was ordained for our instruccion, which are
continually in very great ieoperdy to fall therein. Neither did this man
contemn Christ's commandments: but the great gladness that he was in by
reason of the restitucion of his health, and a certain fervent love which he
was kyendeled withal toward Christ ye autour thereof, would not suffer him
to keep silence any ^nger. Uerely it chances for the most part that we are
best believed, when we tell those things, which we had rather in very deed
keep secret, the^ disclose, if the matter it self enforced not us to utter
that which lies hyd in our stomakes. Now what came of it that this man did
thus blase abroad this miracle? Truly by reason thereof, every man conceived
such an opinion of the Lord Jesus, that he could not now for the great throng
and prease of people that thither resorted, openly enter into the city, as he
was wont to do: but was constrained to avoid the good tounes, and make his
abode in the wilderness. Such as go about to get a name and gaynes by
iugglyng castes and woorkyng of Magical miracles, desyer to be in those
cities, whereas most haunt and resort of people is. But our savior Jesus,
in that he often times shunneth much assembly of people, plainly teaches us
what we ought to do. He that is able to work the miracles of the gospel,
does not so much desyer the great multitude, as the fervent mind and
affeccion of beholders. In great cities many resorted unto him for this purpose
only, to delight their iyes with new and strange sightes. No man follows
Jesus into the wilderness, unless he long after him with a certain vehement
desire and affeccion. He that forgoeth al pleasures of good tounes, and
follows Christ through rough and cumberous places, follows him to his great
commodity. For he that loves him unfeignedly, does in all things follow him
whom he loves: through reproach, hungre, despoylyng of substance,
banishment, imprisonment, tourmentes and death. And such folowers of Christ,
were figured by those that came flockyng out of all countries, and parts of
Galile, unto Jesus: who kept himself close, in desert and solitary places.

The.ij. Chapter.
BUT whithersoeuer a man flies, virtue has ever her fame and glory following
her, even as the shadow follows the body. For he that is unfeignedly good, ca^
never be but one manner of man, and like himself. And as there is always
light, whithersoeuer the body of the su^ne remoueth: even so to what place
soever true godliness remoueth, there is always great resort of people. Now
wilderness was no longer wilderness, after the lord Jesus, the true light of
this world, was gone thither. And yet the person in whom is the power to work
the miracles of the gospel, cease not (as much as in him lies) to avoid
such places whereas much people is assembled to behold him, for that he
knows certainly, what a perilous vice vainglory is. Nevertheless the fervent
desire he has to help and do all men good, does oftimes cause him, though it
be against his nature, to have recourse thither again. And by this means
cummeth it to pass, that whiles the good man is compelled to remove from place
to place, the more receives benefit at his hands.

Wherefore Jesus geuyng us ensample both to fly vain glory, and also
continually to do good to our even christen, within few days after returned
again to Capernaum, from whence he seemed to be driven away before, by reason
of the great importunity of the people, which even in the night time lay
about the gates of the house wherein he soiourned. For as he made Bethleem much
renoumed by his birth, and Nazareth very famous by his educacion, and the
country of Egypt happy, because he fled thither for his preseruacion and
safegarde: so did he, as it were adopte and choose Capernaum to be his
country, both by his often tarrying there, and also by showing of many fayer
miracles in the same. He came again hither in manner by stealth, and first
kept himself secret in a house, before it was known in the city that he
was cum. But as the Sun can not be hyd, so the Lord Jesus can not be kept
close and secret. The rumor which (as it is commonly seen) rose of a few
persons, had now blowe^ abroad throughout the whole city, that Jesus was in
the house. And furthwith thither flocked such a multitude of people that all
the house was filled, and not only that but also the porche, and all the places
about the door were not sufficient to receive them. It is a blessed house
whither Jesus is cum to dwell, and never departs thence agaynt. That house is
the church. For Capernaum bears the figure of the whole world, wheresoever
the Gentyles inhabit. Certes at Jerusalem the Jews cast Jesus out of the
temple, and among the Gentiles, the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and
the multitude of all sorts of people enters into it, after a certain
forcible fashion. The Christian Nouices sit about ye gates, greatly desyring
to be admitted into the Lords house, much houngryng and thirstyng after the
righteousness of the kingdom of heaven. And verily Jesus excludes no man from
this house, neither poor, nor rich, whole nor sick, He prec^^^ the (...)
unto (...)
so that he have a vehement desire to hear him. Wherefore the Lord teaching
us that we ought always chyeflye to care for our soul health, and afterward
for our bodies, first of all ministered unto them the doctrine of the gospel,
wherewith the diseases and maladies of the soul are cured. For this cause such
as are disposed to give alms to ye poor, do very well, if they give them
first a brief exhortacion, that may make them the better in mind and soul,
and then depart with their charity. For the common sort of people be of such
a disordered judgment, that they are more desirous of those things which are
expedient for the body, then of those yt pertayne to their soul health. The
lord evidently declared unto us by his ensample, that our chief care ought to
be for that part, which is the chiefeste part or portion of man, in that he
first taught, and then by and by healed such as were diseased. Now whiles
Jesus was teaching, And there came certa^^ unto him.
and busye about curyng the diseases of their souls, there came unto him
certain men, bringyng with them one that was sick of a Palsy, whose synowes
were so resolved in all parts of his body, through the violence of the
disease; that he could not stir out of his bed, but was feign to be carried
thither upon four men's shoulders. Here have thou plainly set out, the very
image and figure of a mind, which is by worldly lusts and desires made so
womanlyke, and dissolute, that it can in no wise lift up it self to do any
thing that is good and godly, but lies still in the bed of low and filthy
cares, and never remembers any thing that is high or celestial. Now when
they saw how they could not for prease of people that sat so thick about
the gate and porche, bring this sick man to the sight of Jesus, they lifted
him up upon the house, and after they had removed the slates, and made a way
in, they let him down bed and all, with a long cord, and laid him at the
feet of Jesus, nothing doubtyng but that he of his great mercy and goodness,
would help the selye wretch, as soon as he once cast those his pitiful iyes
upon him, and beheld how he lay in his bed like a quick karkas, impotent, and
benumbed in all his lymmes. Jesus saw this miserable person, even before he
was brought unto his presence, and knew right well the great faith of those
that brought him. He could if it had liked him, without leaui^g of or breaking
his tale, have sygnified his pleasure unto them, by whom he had lust, in this
wise: Let the sick of the palsye arise, and being suddenly healed, carry home
his bed again. But his will was to show al men there present, that piteous
sight, and also to declare of what great strength and efficacy true belief
upon him, is with almighty God the father. The disease was incurable, and of
long continuance: the cummyng to Christ very cumberous. And yet the gracious
goodness of the lord, When Jesus saw their faith. etc.
joined with like power, put them in a sure hope to obtain their request.
Wherefore after he saw their notable faith, the more he perceived the man to be
diseased in soul then in body, the more pitye and compassion he took on him.
Every man thought him in a miserable case that thus lacked the use of all his
members: but more miserable was his soul, being in subieccion and bondage of
sin. They looked after nothing else but that the poor wretch should be
restored to perfect health of body, which was a thing far above man's power.
But Jesus being highly pleased with so notable a faith, and therefore willing
to make him all, and in every part whole, turned unto him, and said: Son,
thy sins are forgeuen.

There were present in that assembly, certain Scribes, who for the knowledge
they had in the scriptures, were never the godlyer, and better in their living,
but rather more inclined to surmise matiers against him. They had learned of
the books of the Prophets, and Moses, that it perteyneth to God alone to
pardon sins. For the priest did not release sin, but made intercession unto
God for other men's offenses, and that not without sacrifice. Because the
Scribes knew this right well, they had such secret thoughts and
imaginacions with themselves: What new saying is this that he speaks, which
neither Moses, nor Aaron, nor any of the ancient Prophets, durst presume to
speak. For he says: thy sins are released. Truly he is a blasphemous
person against God, that thus takes upon him gods power. The law commands
sum offenses to be punished with death. And other sum there are, for the which
satisfaccion is made with burnt offerynges, and diverse other kinds of
sacrifices, by the mediacion or intercession of the priest: But he passing
nothing upon such rites and ceremonies, does at once forgive all sins with
bare word of mouth. This thing that he takes upon him, and promyseth,
pertayneth not to manne. It lies in Gods power alone to perform it. Surely
they were offended with the imbecillitie and weakness of his manhood that
they saw, and therefore could suppose nothing of him, above the state and
condition of man. Neither had the vulgar people any greater opinion of him,
which yet by reason of their simplicity, were not so much inclined to pycke
quarrels, as the other were. The spirit of this world put those thoughts in
their minds, who whiles they stacke hard to the litterall sense of Moses
law, were far from the spirit and true meaning thereof, and were so much the
more unapt to be taught the same, because they thought themselves very well
skilled in the scriptures: in somuche that the same thing has here also place,
and is verified, which we see chance among paynters, and singing men, who are
wont to take less for teaching of one that is altogether rude and ignorant
in their art or science, then for him who has been evil enstructed of an
other master in the same: and the reason is, because in teaching of the
ignorant, there is but one labor to be taken: whereas if a man take upon him
to instruct the other, as it is the first, so is it the more paynfull labor
to teach him to forget what he has learned before, then to teach him. And
these ungodly thoughts, they of a certain worldely policy, kept in their
stomakes for fear of the people, in whose presence they much advanced and
magnified themselves for their great knowledge and understanding. The Lord
Jesus who rather desired to declare his divine power by deeds, And immediately
when Jesus perceived in spir^^e. etc.
then to utter the same by words, because he would plainly show unto the
Scribes how there is nothing so closely hid in men's breasts, be they never
so subtle and crafty, that his holy spirit (which searches, and thoroughly
sees all things) knows not, turned him unto them, and as though they had
spoken out those things, which they inwardlye thought in their minds, said
in this wise: Why have you such slau^derous imaginacions in your hertes? why
do you rather judge me by this weak and feeble body of mine, then by my deeds?

Why do you not gather of these my works which you see with your iyes and
cannot deny, that those things are of truth, which can in no wise be seen
with your corporal iyes? you are offended with me because I said: Thy sins
are forgeuen: and deem it to be a vain saying, and of none effect, because you
see not the efficacy thereof, which puts forth and shows it self in the
soul of man. But you that have your bodily iyes whole and faultlesse have
spiritual iyes faulty and blemished.

What if I speak like words unto the other, and make the efficacy thereof
appear unto your iyes? Is it not then reason that you believe the thing which
you see not, being thereunto enduced by the thing you see? There is nothing
that man can easelyer do, then speak: and contrarilye, there is nothing so
hard, as to perform what is spoken. God alone ca^ as easily do the one as
the other. And though hitherto he never gave this power to manne, yet it is not
out of his power to give it to whom it pleases him. And long since he
promised by the prophets that he would send his Messiah, who should cure the
diseases of the people of Israel, and abolishe and clean take away sins.
Therefore regard you not this simple body of mine, like in all points to
yours: neither behold ye my garmente, not decked and trymmed with
Philacteries, and embroudered hemmes: nor yet my speech nothing differyng from
other men's. Let the thing self be the ground and foundation of your
judgment. It is no maisterie for a man to say unto a sinner: Thy sins are
pardoned. But that ye may know that ye son of man. etc.
And it is like easy to say unto ye sick of the Palsy: Arise, take thy bed
and wa^ke. You have heard me speak the one saying and find fault therewith.
Now hear ye the other, which ye cannot likewise find fault withal, when you
see evidently with your iyes how the thing ensues immediately of my words. And
this will I do: not to boast and brag upon my power, but to the intent you may
perceive that God has given power unto the son of man, who appears unto
you an vnderlyng and a weak person, to release sins with word, (which power
your priests never had) and that not in Iewry alonely, but also in all regions
and countries of the world, in such wise that whatsoever he releaseth in
earth, is released in heaven: and whatsoever he leuseth not in earth, the same
remains still bound and vnleused in heaven. You have no cause to pick
quarrels, and surmyse matters against me but to rejoice and be glad for your
singular wealth and commodity, if god of his infinite mercy, have increased
his bounteous goodness toward you. If you say that God cannot thus do, then
do you derogate or diminishe his Majesty. If you say he will not, you offend
his goodness. If you say he does not, albeit he has once promised so to do,
the^ do you make him a liar. Finally if you be void of belefe in such things
as are spiritual, and pertain unto the soul, whereas ye can not thwarte and
cauyll in the things you see dooen before your iyes, then do you plainly
declare your obstinate malice.

He spoke unto y^ sick of the Palsy. etc.
When Jesus had spoken these words, and they diligently marked what he would
do, he turned him to the sick of the Palsy, and said: I say unto the,
arise, take up thy bed, and go hence into thy house. And he had scarcelye
spoken these words, but an effectual virtue thereof manifestly ensued* For the
sick manne began not by little and little, and at the length with much a do to
move himself: But as soon as Jesus had spoken the word, he raised himself,
and stood up as lusty and courageous, as though he had never felt any Palsy
at all. Then lifted he up his bed, and laid it on his shoulders, and so went
out through the prease of people, showing the^ al a new sight that never had
been seen before yt day, in as much as he, who was a little before bedred, and
carried like a dead karkas on four men's shoulders, was now cranke, and
lusty: yea and able enough without any help, to carrye so great a burden.
They made him room to go out, who would give him none to cum in. And both
these things were right expedient to be done. First that the people should
not let him have entrance, because to make the greatness of his faith
manifest to them all: then ye room should be made him to go out through the
midst of the prease, because every body might see this wonderful sight and
miracle. The Scribes saw these things, and were not only never the better
therefore, but also more envious, and maliciously set against Jesus. The residew,
so many as were present, being greatly amassed with this strange miracle, In
so much that they were all amassed.
glorified god, who had given such power to man, with bare word of mouth both
to forgive sins, and also to heal an incurable disease, truly confessing
that among all the marvelous deeds, which were either reported to be done of
the holy men that were before their days, or else of such as lived in their
time, there was none comparable unto this. Now if we stand still many times
when we see things wrought ^y grauers, and painters, and diligently behold and
view every point of the workemanshippe, always espying some new thing, that we
saw not before: me thinks it right expedient yt we stay and tarry here a
while, to behold this notable sight, and with godly curiosity, to consydre
every thing: because whatsoever the Lord did in earth, he did it for this
purpose, that we studying the mysteries thereof, should pick out for our
instruction, what so ever conduces to virtuous and godly living. And this
shall we do with much more profit, if we first consider what was outwardly
showed unto the corporal iyes: then what was sygnified by this figure to be
inwardly wrought in men's souls. Let us therefore first of all pondre the
violence and greatness of this disease, which the lord Jesus cured with
word. For the palsy is nothing else but a noysom humor, that takes and
astoyneth the synowes of the body, which are the instruments of moving, so
that he that is sick of this disease, has members not to use, but to pain
him with grievous burden, and does almost appear to be a live carkas living
only to his pain and torment. And for the most part, this disease either
riddeth a man suddenly out of the world, or else if it chance not so to do,
then after long continuance it makes an end of him, with a more cruel and
paynfull death: and is one of those diseases, that the physicians reck^n
incurable, and for that cause will not by their good will, meddle with all, or
else if they assaye to overcome it, then at the length, after they have a great
while striuen therewith in vain, they as the weaker part, geueit over, and
forsake their cure, specially if the said disease have once taken not one or
two parts, but the whole body. Now how incurable this man's disease was, it
plainly appeared in that he kept his bed continually, and was borne like a dead
carkas, on four men's shoulders. Furthermore this kind of disease, many times
makes a man speachlesse and also febleth and dulleth the quickness of the
wit. And so did it fare (as it seems) with this pacient, who albeit that he
was in this yuell taking, yet never desired he the lord to help him. Who is
so hard hearted, whom so pitiefull a sight would not move to compassion? who
would not think such a one to be in better case dead, then after this
manoure alive? But now, christian man, behold a little while with thy spiritual
iyes, and consydre how much worse is the palsy of that man's soul, whose
powers are altogether entangled with the most triflyng cares of transytory
things, and worldly vanities, in so much that when he should do any
charitable deed or work of mercy, then is he altogether benumbed and taken
with a palsy, so that he has neither hands to relieve the pore at their
need, nor feet to go to Jesus, nor tongue to desire his savior to help him:
but as one clean dead to Justice is carried about hither and thither,
whithersoeuer it pleases the sensual lusts and appetites of his body, which
be as it were his porters, to carry him. What shall the sely soul do, which
because it is altogether dissolute, and weakened by superfluity, by carnal
pleasure, by inordinate desire of vain glory, and worldly riches, has no
strength at all to lift up it self from the filthy cares of this world, to
the love of heavenly things? It is altogether fastened to the naughty bed of
carnal lusts, and therein lies, and rests. And being in this case, it
far passes man's power to help it. Only Jesus is able with his almighty
commandment, to put away all the violence of this disease. Wherefore we ought
to resort unto this physycia^, unto whom no disease is incurable, but not
without a great faith, which may do so much with him, that this pacient was
helped even for the belefe of other men. They prayed not with words, but yet
were they earneste suitors in deed. When faith heartily desires any thing of
Christ, her request is very affectuall, and no marvel sith that even we
mortal men, feel great carfulness in our minds (such are the natural
affeccions of man) when we se one that ha^geth upon us, with all his heart and
mind, and has put his sure confidence and trust in us. God requires of
sinners, neither burnt sacrifices, nor offered gifts. Only acknowleage thy
sycknes, and trust in thy phisycian: and yet no man can make the able thus to
do, but god alone. For after that he of his inestimable goodness, has once
decreed to heal the soul taken with the palsy, he first of all puts into
it a certain wonderful heaviness and irksomeness of ones self, in so much
yt the sinner hates himself, and is weary of his former life. Now he sees in
what ignorance and darkness he has been of long season, what grievous
offenses he was wont to commit, and abhors himself, and would without
doubt, be in utter despair of salvation, unless he that put in the vinegre
of sorrow, did also give him the oil of good hope. The justice of God, ^ore
troubles the synnefull soul. It threateneth with vengeance, and punishment
due unto the sins: It threatens with hell and damnacion. But on the
othersyde the remembrance of the goodness and great mercy of God, calls back
the sinner from desperacion, for that god seeks not the death of a sinner but
wylleth rather that he turn and live. The lord Jesus who restored the law
of nature, and destroyed not Moses law but made it perfect, did also apply
himself to the common reason and judgment of the vulgar people. As the
pocion ministered by a faithful phisician sore vexes the whole body, and
brings it out of quiet, specially in a ieperdous disease, and the more it
works, and troubles the pacient, the more hope is there of health: even so
the nearer unto despera cion the penitent sinner is, the nearer is he to his
soul health, Jesus being his phisycian. Now mark me well a shamefast
unshamefastness. For shame, as it is commonly said, is unprofitable to the
neady man.

Shame puts away shame, even as one nail dryueth out an other. It is an
unprofitable shame that causes a man to hyde and keep secret his sycknesse.
This shame is put away by the long werinesse of the disease, and the great
hope that a man has, to recover his health: and now is he not ashamed to
confess his sycknesse, because he is ashamed to be sick. What manne if he be
grievously diseased in his body, has any regard of shame at all? Do not
men in such case discover, even the most privy members of their bodies,
and suffer the phisycian to handle them? Like affeccion of mind is in him, who
has begone to knowledge the fylthie disease of his soul. For what lewder
pageaunte or pranke cowld there be played, then to clime up upon another man's
house, to cast down the tiles, to make an hole, and convey down from above a
foul loathsome sight that every body abhorred, and lay it before all their
iyes? What would ye proud pharisey have said here? Certes he would have
cried: Oh vilaynous deed: and over this have rayled out of measure against
their lewdness, who had contrary to the common law, made an hole, and
forciblie entered into an other man's several house, and with such a deadly
sight, both interrupted the holy preaching of gods word, and also defiled
the iyes of the audience. He would have commanded the karkaslyke sick man to
be had away, and then have all to washed himself with water. But with those
things, in as much as they were an evident proof and argument of a notable
faith toward him, the Lord Jesus was hyghly delyted, which they that crake
upon the righteousness of Moses law, would have been offended with all: in
somuche that he, and yt not lokyng to be desired, healed this miserable
creature: and first of all he cured the diseases of his soul, which are
sins, and then forthwith delivered his body of the palsy, because that as
there are many vices, which after they have taken their beginning of the body,
do from thence redounde into the soul: so it chances oftentimes that the
body is infected with the disease, that is first bred and engendered in the
soul, as when lecherye which is engendered of the humors of the flesh,
defyleth the soul, and from thence returns again her malady and evil
effect into the body, there causyng either the palsy, or the falling evil: or
else when that envy, which takes her beginning of a vicious soul, does also
wast the body, and bring it to a co^sumption. He only is able to cure both
the parts of man, which made both. Here is it also to be considered, how
great was the largess of Jesus in forgeuyng of sins. For when he says: thy
sins are remitted, he lewseth the^ all together. Neither is there any mention
made of the merits paste, nor any requiring of sacrifices, or satisfaccion,
but mention of faith only. It is inoughe humbly to have cum to the feet of
Jesus. That man has made sufficient sacrifice, who with perfect faith has
showed himself unto Jesus, then which sacrifice, there is none more acceptable
unto him. The sick of the palsy was wholly displeased with himself, both for
that he knew his own sinful living, and also because his body was oppressed
with so miserable a sickness. All his trust was in the mighty goodness of
Jesus, who made him all whole because he wholly committed himself unto this
phisician: he considered not how incurable was his disease, but only regarded
how mighty, and good was the phisician, unto whom he committed himself. Now
what hope of recovery is there in those persons, that cherysh, and make much
of their disease, that fly out of the physycians sight, yea that hate, and
abhor him? If thou be ashamed to acknowledge thy syckenesse to a man
phisycian, or else if thou have any mistrust in him, who peradventure when he
knows thy syckenes, will rather hit the in the teeth therewith, then cure the
same, yet hide it not from Christ, who discloseth no man's offenses, but
heals all men, and that frelye: and thus do thou to thentent it may likewise
chance unto the, as it chanced to the sick of the palsy. What did he* He
all things now turned clean contrary, lyfted up his bed on his shoulders, as
one ruling his sensual appetites and passions, which he served before. For
this is the very thing that is meant by bearing of the cross. This is it that
is understand, by crucifying the flesh with her vices and co^cupiscences. Now
neadeth he no more four porters to carry him. He walks on his own feet,
whithersoeuer ye spirit of Christ leads him, neither goes he, but whither
he is commanded to go. For what is it to walk, but by continual increase of
virtue, still to go forward, and every day to wax better and better? what is
it to return into the house fro whence he came, but to knowleage in what case
he came out from thence, and by whose benefit, he returned thither again
soodainly changed, and altered both in body and soul. For it is the
property of the phariseis, to dwell without in streets, market places, and
whereas conuenticles and unlawful assembles be. He dwells at home in his
own house, whosoever knows how naught and vertuelesse he is of himself, and
wholly ascribes what virtue and goodness soever he has, to the free
liberality of our savior. Now will I dismiss the from any longer beholding
of this sight, after I have rehearsed unto the by way of epilogacion, the
persons of this seen or pageaunt. The sick of the palsy, and they that
carrye him, be made shameless through their great faith, and obtain their
peticion. Jesus is so much delyted with their faith, that even of his own
accord, and not desired of them, he doubleth his benefit. The simple and
unlearned people, discerning nothing in him, whom they believed to be naught else
but a man, only merueyleth at the power of God. The scribes alone muttre
softly with themselfes against Jesus. Let us therefore eschew the ensample of the
said Scribes, who whiles they study to aduasice their own glory, go about
to duske the glory of Jesus. Let us of ye simple sort of people, and with them
glorifye God, not only if it please him at any time of his great merciful
goodness to heal the infirmytie of our souls, but also whenever we see any
other, through his said bounteous goodness, forsake their old vicious living,
and cumme to amendment.

After this so notable a miracle was wrought at Capernau^, Jesus, to thentente
he might do good to more, departed thence again, and went to the sea. He did
not convey himself away, because he would not help men and do them good,
but while he forsook the incurable scribes, he provoked the godly by his
departure, the more to desire his presence. For there likewise resorted a
great number of people unto the sea, teaching us that we ought in like manoure
to forsake all things, and follow Jesus whithersoeuer he goes. For he is
every where a savior, whether he be resydent in cities, or travail thoroughe
tounes, and villages, or continewe in ye wilderness, or go up to mountains,
or come down into the plain, or else repair to seas and waters. When he saw
therefore, And as Jesus passed up. etc.
that so great a multitude of people was cumme thither, and knew right well the
cause of their cumming, he taught them on the shore. And as he there walked, he
passed by a certain custom house, where those are wont to sit that demand
custom, and towle, of such as sail by: and espied in that house a certain
manne named Matthew, who was also called Leuy, the son of Alphey, sytting at
the receipt of custom, for he was a publycane or customer. And albeit this
sort of men was every where much hated of the people, yet specially among
the Jews, they were counted abominable. For they use to bye this office of
the prince, for an unreasonable sum of money, and therefore to thentent their
advantage and gain may be the more, for the most part they take and extorte
of all men, without pity and conscience, and put maryners, and wayfaring
men to much business, unto whom many times damage and disprofite enough
otherwise happens. There were very many among the Jews, who denied that the
Jews being the holy people of god ought to pay tribute unto the Emperor,
since he was an heathen prince and a worshipper of Idolles. And for this cause
they greatly abhorred the Publicans, who to have the gaynes of the money which
they levied over and above that was due, served him in gatheryng of toll and
custom. The lord which had before imbrayded ye scribes with their unbelief,
for that they murmured against his miracle, whereas the simple people gloryfyed
and praised god therefore, And he arose and followed him. etc.
because he would now eftsoon show that none be farther from true
holiness, then such as think themselves perfyte holy men, called Matthew
out of the custom house, and commanded him to follow him. Matthew being
sodainlye changed, and made a new man, forsook his gayning seat, and followed
poor Jesus, to thentent he might be enriched with the riches of the ghospel.
All men did not so greatly merueyle at this fact, and yet was it in deed more
wonderful then that, which they so much merueiled at a little before, when
the sick of the palsy was healed. For consydre me well what a palsy he has
whose mind is fastened to covetousness. Neither is it vnknownen how
intricate, and busye, the accomptes of publicans be, and therefore that he
sodeinly changed went out of his custom house, forsakyng all that ever he
had, and following Jesus, was more to be merueyled at, then the sick of the
palsy when he whipte out of his bed, and went home unto his house. The
pharisey hears Jesus reasoning or disputing on many matiers, and sees him
work sundry miracles, and yet distrusteth, and murmureth against him. The
publycane who never heard ne saw such things before, obeyed thonly word of
Jesus. And behold an other occasion, whereby both the wickedness of the
phariseis, and also the bounteous goodness of Jesus may the better be set
forth and known. And it came to pass that when Jesus etc.
For Matthew being now the assured disciple of Jesus, to thentent he might
commend his master to more, and bring such as were his late companions, and
fellows of the same state and condition that he was, to the lucre of the
gospel, was not afearde to desire the lord that he would vouchesafe to be
his geast at home in his house. Jesus lightely condescended unto his request,
because that before he so wyllingly obeyed when he was called. Matthew supposyng
that he had obtained no small thing, prepared a right gorgious and a royal
feast, which should suffice a great many, that is to wete, certain
disciples whom the lord had now gathered, and besides them diverse other,
which then followed Jesus and went with him as unbidden geastes to this feast:
and many publicans, yea and sinners to, whom for old familiarity and
acquayntaunce Matthew had bidden thereunto, being nothing ashamed what manoure of
companions he once had, sith he was the^ departed from them to an other
fellowship. For he trusted it would cumme to pass, yt like as he was called of
the lord, so should he through the lords merciful vocacion, have many of
them scholefelowes with him in learning the doctrine of the gospel (whereby
is given abundance of heavenly treasure) who were before his fellows in
vicious living, and getting of slanderous gains. He received this great
confidence through the gracious goodness yt he perceived in Jesus toward all
men. Truly it was mete this should be a great feast, which represented ye
church that should be gathered together of the gentiles. For the feasts of
the Jews be small, and receyuable but of few persons, because they only
follow the flesh or litterall sense of the law, where as the spirit and true
meaning thereof, dilateth it self in most ample wise, and receives al sorts
of people. All men love liberty and have need of mercy: And when the
scribes and phariseis saw him eat with publicans. etc.
few have righteousness, and yet did the phariseis challenge the same
notwithstanding they lacked it, and were in very deed unrighteous: who when
they saw Jesus feasting with publica^s and sinners (whom they as men of
great perfeccion and holiness would not vouchsafe so much as to speak unto)
went unto his disciples, being then but simple ignorant persons, and such as
they thought might easily be plucked from their master: and them did they hunt
after and assaye to win with their venomous whisperyng. Why (quod they) does
your master, whom you (John forsaken) follow as the more holy and perfect
manne, eat and drink with sinners, since that the communion of table is the
greatest token of familiarity that may be? Has not hered this scripture
following? with the holy thou shalt be holy, and with the froward thou shall be
froward. Does not he consider how that by reason he is thus familiar, and
keeps company with sinners, he does encourage the^ to co^tinewe still in
sin, which else peradventure, if men would avoid their company, would
amend their lives: When the disciples, who were as yet raw in their
profession, had no ready answer to make them, but only with a simple plain
faith hanged upon their Lord, When Ies^ heard that he saieh. etc.
then Jesus (unto whom neither the secret words, nor yet the hid thoughts of
the phariseis were unknown) made answer for them in this wise: O you
phariseis, why do you grudge and murmour against me, for that I rather feast
with the^ whom you take for wicked and abominable persons, then with the
priests, scribes, and phariseis? The physicians are praised who being
themselves in good health go yet unto ye sick when they are sent for: And am I
blamed for going unto them who acknowledge the disease of their soul, and
desire a physycian to cure them? Such as are in good health do not quarrel
with the physycian and say: Why visytest thou such, and such, and not us:
For they that are whole have no need of a physycian. The faculty of phisycke
must always be ready for those that be evil at ease. These folks which
acknowledge their disease, are right glad that the physician is cum. For you
saw by that I did unto the sick of the palsy, how I have power given me to
take away sin. You that think your selves whole, and take upon you to be
right wisemen, have no cause to quarrel with the physicia^ if he cum not unto
you. I was sent into ye world, to take away the sin of the world. Whosoever
knowleageth his sickness, and desires the physycians help, him will not I
fail at his need. Now he that thinks himself faultles, if he be in a right
belief, neadeth nothing that I can do. But if he be deceived in his opinion,
or else know right well his inward infirmity, I came not to call the rightwise
but sinners etc.
and yet dissembleth the same, then is he paste all hope of recovery. And for
this cause the physycia^ should but lose his labor, if he went unto him. For
who can heal a man against his will? Therefore the physycia^ is unjustly
reproved, if he follow the rules of his faculty: but they are very vncurtuous,
who when themselves are in good health, have great disdain and envy that the
physycia^ should be present with the sick. And this my fact ought not to seem
strange and uncouth unto you, which profess the knowledge of the law. For
you read therein as follows: I will mercy rather then sacrifice. God spoke
these words by his Prophet, sygnifying thereby that the carnal justice of the
law, which stands in abstayning from open offenses and the obseruacion of
ceremonies, should be set aside and abolyshed. He that neither commits
murder, theft, nor aduoutry, he that rests on the Sabbath day, fasteth upon
days appointed, washes, and makes sacrifice, is righteous after thestimacio^
of man: But god requires another manner of righteousness, which stands in free
beneficence or well doing to our neighbor, in forgenyng the^ that have
offended us, in meekness and gentle demeanor. Now how far are they from
this praise, which do not only themselves not help their neighbor in his
necessytie, but also have great despite, and babble against it, if any manne so
do? God promised to send you such a Messiah, not as should excel the
Phariseis in sacrifices, phylacteries, fastinges, and long prayers, for
thobseruacio^ whereof they magnify and set out themselves unto the people, but
such a one as should be beneficial to all men, a lantern to them that be
out of the way, a helper to oppressed persons, a co^forter to such as are in
adversity, a phisicia^ to all that are co^trite in heart, and finally such a
one as should join unto god, those that seemed to be far from God: and
contrariwise, declare that such as appeared to be next God, and most holiest,
were very far from true godliness. With these words the lord Jesus both
stopped the mouths of the Phariseis, and also taught his disciples how
charitably they should demean themselves toward sinners. For this cause we are
much bound to the wicked phariseis, who so often provoke the lord to expoune the
doctrine of the gospel.

Behold there went also unto Jesus certain of John's disciples in company with
the false accusyng Phariseis. For they also were attached with a spiece of
humain envy, for that Jesus seemed to deface the great estimacion of their
master John, notwithstanding his life and rule appeared to be strayter then
Christ's was, and that he had mo disciples then the other. Wherefore they went
unto Jesus, and moved unto him this capcious question: why (quod they) do John's
disciples, and the phariseis often times fast, and thy disciples not fast at all?
Unto this question, because they assailed him and not his disciples, the lord
made a gentler answer, than he did a little before, when he defended his
disciples: teaching us hereby, that Christian charity, which uses all
myldnesse in the euyls and displeasures done unto herself privately, is more
diligent in defendyng other from the same. For the Christian bishop must be
paciente, and meek, in sufferyng all injuries done unto his own person: but
yet ought he with diligent endeavor to help his flock, whenever it is in
ieoperdie. Wherefore Jesus said: You that have diligently heard John Baptist
preach, ought to call to remembrance how he preached that I was the
bridgrome and he the bryde gromes friend. It is mete that all heaviness be
away when the brydegrome is present.

Moses is a servant and no brydegrome, Can the children of the weddi^g fast?
etc.
and therefore fastinges were convenient for him, because the same do cause
sadness, and abate myrthe. It is well done that they fast, which continue in
the Synagoge, being a servant and not a bride. For such haunt not the
brydegromes chaumber. But the fre borne children, who haunte the weddyng
chaumber, cannot fast, as long as they have the brydegrome himself present
with them: because their myrthe is so great, that it will not suffer them to
remember heavy things. He that for dread of punishment does his duty, can
in no wise be meary. Now the children who have received the spirit of
liberty, perceyuyng that they are dearly beloved, and cared for of the
brydegrome, be never careful lest they offend in these things which were
commanded for a time, to men of a servile nature: as for an ensample, in
washinges, in thobseruacion of the Sabbothe, in choice of meats, in apparel,
in holy days, in sacrifices. They put their confidence in the might and
goodness of the brydegrome who is able without all these things, to give them
perfect righteousness. Spiritual belefe takes away fleshly carefulnes.
Charity that makes all things pleasant, causes gladness. The brydegrome
has his own proper meat, from the which his companions can not abstain.

The word of God, and the flesh of the brydegrome, is the meat and food of
the soul, and his blood is the drink of the same. Such as cleave nygh unto
me, are ever desirous to eat their fill of this meat: and they that haunt the
bride gromes weddyng chamber, do always covet to be drunken with this drink.
But like as corporal meat causes not righteousness, even so fasting makes
not a man just: yea it is oftentimes seen that he which eats his meat, is
more rightuous then the faster. Such fastings as are commanded by the law,
are full of heaviness, and therefore displeasaunt to almightye God, who loves
a cherefull gyuer. He can in no wise be merye and chereful, that fears and
trembles. But whosoever knows that he is set at liberty in these things,
either to do them, or not to do them, and yet moved by charity fasteth,
the same undoubtedly fasteth with great mirth and gladness: not because his
fasting is so prescribed by the law, but for that charity moves him so to
do. When my disciples are once cum to that strength of mind, that I now go
about by my teaching and preaching to bring them unto, than shall charity
cause them to do more of their own free will, than now does the prescripcion
either of the law orels of John get of you by compulsion. But as yet they are
not cum to this strength and perfeccion. They are yet tender and weak: for the
presence of my body lets them to attain thereto. The day shall once cum, when
the corporal presence of the brydegrome shall be taken away from them, and then
being made stronger by receiuyng the holy ghost from heaven, they shall not
only fast, and that of their own accord, but also gladly and with right good
will do things, in the atchiuyng whereof, more strength and constaunt courage
of mind shall be showed, then in fasting. But forasmuch as this doctrine is
spiritual, it can not be received of them, who all their life long have enured
themselfes with Pharisaicall ceremonies. And for this cause I pyked out simple,
and ignorant young men to be my disciples. For I should but lose my labor if I
did commit spiritual and heavenly doctrine unto their minds, that are so
supersticious in keeping of carnal ceremonies. Old things best agrees with
old, and new things with new, the which if a man myngle together, he does
not only labor in vain, but also makes those persons wurse, whom he goes
about to refourme. For it is better for them still to continue in their old
supersticiousnesse, then whiles a man does his endeavor to bring them to the
freedom of the spirit, to provoke them (all fear of transgression laid
aside) to commit sin at liberty. For as it is more a do to teach such
an one any craft or occupacion, as has conceived a wrong opinion of him
self, thinkyng that he has good skyll therein, and has none at all, then him
who is altogether ignorant in the same: even so is it the hardest thing that
may be, to teach such persons the ryghtuousnesse of the ghospel, which for
thobseruacion of certain folysh carnal ceremonies, believe surely they have
attained perfect ryghtuousnes. And this doubtless is the cause that I find
fishermen, publicans, sinners, unchaste women and Ethnikes, more apt to learn
this spiritual philosophy, then the scribes, phariseis and priests, who
suppose that perfect godlynes stands in thobseruacion and keeping of man's
ceremonies. John as a mean between the old law and the new went about to
myngle together two sundry doctrines. For he durst not commit this lively
philosophy, pure and vnmengled as it was, unto them that were weak of mind.
Now all is weak that is humayne and carnal. And contrarily that is full of
life, virtue, and strength, whatsoever is godly, spiritual, and heavenly.
Wherefore unto my disciples (whom I chose rude and ignorant, to the intent I
might the sooner enstruct them in this strong and pithful Philosophy) I
prescribe none of these things following: Eat these meats, forbear these, now
rest, now labor, use such apparel, touch not this thing, handle not that. And
the cause is for fear lest they would always continewe weak, if they once
learned of me their master to put any trust in such corporal things. It is
a thing very unprofitable to join things together, which disagree one with
an other.

No man also seweth a piece of new clothe unto an old garment; The (...)
else takes he away the new piece thereof from the old, and so is the rent
wurse. And no man pours new wine into old bottels, else the new wine does
burst the bottels, and the wyue runs out, and the bottels are mar^ed. But
new wine must be put into new bottels. For there is no man so far from
reason, that if he be disposed to amend an old garment, will sewe thereunto a
patche of new clothe. And why so? certes for that he perceyueth if he should
so do, he should both lose his new cloth, and also make the hole of the old
garment bigger then it was before. For being offended with the notable
diuersytie between the piece of cloth sewed on, and the ill mended garmente, he
straight ways plucketh of the piece that he sewed to, and so the hole of the
same garment gapeth fowler then it did before. Neither is there any man so
folysh as to put new wine in old bottels. And no man pout^h new wine into old
bottels.
And why? because he sees that he should sustain double loss thereby. For the
new wine wurketh so fervently through the vehemency of the fumes therein
enclosed, that it breaks ye bottels being weak by reason of age, all to
pie^es: and so are both bottels and wine clean lost, and spilt. How does he
then provide both for the safety of the one and the other? Truly he puts
the new wine into new bottels. Even so they whose minds have of long time
been accustomed to the naughty wine of Pharisa^call supersticion, can in no
wise away with the new wine of heavenly and spiritual doctrine, but loathe and
abhor the same, stylle calling after a taste of the wurse wine that has been
their accustomable drink. And that Jesus spoke the truth herein, the Phariseis
them selves many times declared by their deeds.

For as it cha^nced on a certain season that his disciples trauayled thorough
a corn fyeld, and that upon the Sabbath day, on the which day it was a
matter of conscience among the Jews to do any manner of weorke, they went
before, and Jesus their master followed. And anon provoked by hunger, they
began to pluck the ears of the corn, and with the chasyng of their hands
to rub once the corn, and eat it. Now hear how the old bottels were
offended with the new wine of the liberty of the gospel, calling after the
old wine of keeping the Sabbath, that had clean lost his verdure. For the
Phariseis, who as men very righteouse in their own conceyptes followed Jesus,
beholding what the disciples did, wrongfully blamed the Lord in them. For like
as the vertuousnesse of the scholars is a great commendacion to the master,
even so their mysbehaueoure, and lewd taches are reproched and laid unto
those that instructed them. They told the lord, and poynted unto his
disciples, as though they had done a greuouse offense, for that they brake the
Sabbath day, to the end that he should cause them to leave work, and by
that means approve the pharisaicall supersticion: orels if he would not so
do, then might they take some occasion to pi^ke a quarrel, or surmise some
matter against him. The Lord so defended his disciples, that he disproued the
learned in the law of Moses, by the authority of the law, and of his
gentleness vouchesafed to teach them the true meaning thereof, And he said
unto them: have ye never read? etc.
which in deed deserved shaperly to be rebuked. With what face (quod he) do ye
accuse my disciples, for that thorough constraint of hunger, they pluck a few
ears of corn, being by chance in their way, for their relief and
sustenaunce? sith there is express mention in the very law it self (whereof
you profess your selves to be teachers) how David when he was in like
necessity, did a thing which sounds much more to the breach of the law
then this. For he being almost famished, and in great danger to perysh for
lack of food, fled for succor unto the house of God: and although he were a
lay man, was not afraid to desire Abiathar, then chyef of the priests, to
give him those most holy loaves called the show bread, the which it was not
lefull for any man to eat of, but the priests only ^ and that but during the
little while they were within the precinct of the Temple, occupied about making
of sacrifice. Abiathar was not here ignorant what the law had commanded, and
yet feared not he to deliver unto David, and his train, the said holy loaves,
to be eaten in the holy place. If you know not that this is scripture, orels
if you have it not in memory, howetha^ for shame dare you profess the
knowledge yt of law? If you know, and remember it, why do you in a like ease
quite Abiathar, and David, yea and allow their fact, and yet accuse my
disciples as guilty of an heinous trespass? If the rigorousnes of the law did
then give place unto the necessitye of the neighbor, when the law was of
most force and strength, how much more then stands it now with reason
that the ceremonies of the same law, give place thereunto, whenever charity
moves a man to help his even Christen?

Moreover it is likewise commanded in the law, that every man ought to love
his neighbor with like affeccion as he loves himself. Now since this is the
most principal and greatest of all the commandments in the whole law, why
do you then of an unright judgment break that which is chiefest, and
always continues, for the obseruacion of those things which are of less
value, and shall not endure for ever? The time once has been when the Sabbath
was not holy day. And the time shall cum when to all true and Godly men, every
day shall be like holy. But the time never was, nor never shall be, when it has
not or shall not be an holy deed for man to succor his neighbor in his need.
The law forbyddeth murder. Truly he murthereth, whosoever when it lies in his
power to save a man, does not succor him at all. And this law is
permanent, and shall continue for evermore. The same law forbids also to
work upon the Sabbath day. Now what a wrong shapen holiness is this, if a
man whiles he fears to break the Sabbath, suffer his brother to peryshe,
when he will not stick to pluck out his ass fallen by chance into a dyche
upon the same day, without any fear, or scruple of conscience to break the
seventh, or Sabbath day?

When Jesus had with these, And he said unto them: the Sabbath. etc.
and such like manifest reasons, declared how aukewardly devout and holy they
were, he added this general sentence: The Sabbath day (quod he) was instituted
for men's cause, and not men made for the Sabbath day. The son of man came
not to destroy men, but to save them. And for that cause has he power, yea,
clean to take away the Sabbath, so often as man's health so requires. And that
which I have spoken of the Sabbath, is to be thought and demed of all like
constitucio^s. They were all instituted for a season, to this end, that the
sturdye and disobediente people should by little and little accustom
themselfes to obey gods commandments, to the intent that they might by
corporal figures, be brought, and as it were led by the hand, to the
understanding of spiritual things.

He breaks the Sabbath day godlily, who nothing troubled with evil lusts,
breaks it only for the good zeal he has to help his even Christen.
Fasting is a godly thing, but the same is made ungodly, and detestable, if it
being only instituted for man's soul health, be abused to the destruction both
of body and soul. Again a vow is a holy thing, but the same is made unholy,
if a man by reason of a supersticious mind he has to perform it, be
withdrawn from the perfourmaunce of such things, as nerer appertain to true
godliness. He does well, and like a good holy manne, whosoever makes his
oblacion at the altar. But again, that is an unholy gift which a man
offers, before his neighbor be made at one. So is it also well done to pass
little upon the color, and fashion of apparel, so often as it behooves a man so
to do, because man was not made for the garments sake, but the garment first
invented for the use, and commodity of man. In like manner, meat is ordained
for man's cause, and not man made for meats sake. Wherefore it is lofull to eat
all kinds of meat when man's necessity so requires. For all these corporal
things, wherein you put perfect righteousness, as your temple, sacrifices,
meat, clothing, holy days, fastings, vows, and offered gifts, are vnholily
observed, if for the obseruacion thereof, the health of your even christen be in
any wise hurt or appair^d. And again they are well and holily kept, if
charity toward your neighbor so requiri^g, you nothing regard whatsoever
is carnal, but truly perform in your hertes, that which such corporal
things be figures and significacions of. Of such manier of constitucions,
Moses was the minister, and not the auctour: the servant, and not the
master. Such as with a servile mind cleue still unto him, do very
supersticiouslye keep those things, that are comprised in the letter of the
law. But they that stick unto the son of man (who is Lord over the whole
law, and teaches how all things which were figured by those corporal
shadows and figures ought to be observed after the spiritual sense and
meaning) are free, and clean discharged in conscience, from any longer
observing of such Iewishe ceremonies.

The.iij. Chapter.

WIth such words the lord Jesus as he walked on the way in the field, both
disproued the false reprofe of the Phariseis, and also defended his innocent
disciples. But to the intent we should plainly learn that none are more given
to pieke quarrelles, then such as have conceived a wrong opinion of their own
holiness, after Jesus was entered into the Synagoge, there to teach the people
according unto his accustomed manner, occasion was eftsoon ministered, both to
him to do a good, and a charitable deed, and also to the Phariseis to
surmyse sum matter against him. For there was one there present among the
people, who had (which was a pytifull syghte to behold) a withered and a lame
hand, and therefore carried about with him, a dead member that did him no
slede: and so much the more miserable was he, because he was wont with his
hand labor, to find both himself and also all his poor household. But oh
malicious and wicked Phariseis, quick syghted to deprave, and find fault with
Christ's benefits, but blind to understand the heavenly doctrine. By those
things that they saw with their corporal iyes, they knew that he was a
natural man, and yet by his deeds and miracles that he wrought, they
perceived not his divine power. They saw how the sely fellow was in a
miserable case, and knew right well that Jesus was merciful, and straight
ways gessed what would cum of it. And now (...) they about to seek a quarrel,
not against the disciples, as they did before for pluckyng the ears of corn,
but against the Master himself, who defended them. They mark whether he
being of nature ready to help all that are in distres and misery, dare in the
presence and sight of the Synagoge, heal a man upon the sabbath day, because
that if he so do, they may accuse him of breakyng the Sabbath, for as much as
they shall have the people to bear witness with them what is doe^.

That pitiful creature desired not Jesus to help him, but yet to say the
truth, it was a kind of desire for him to cum in to the sight of merciful
Jesus. The Lord, because he would have them all to take good heed unto the
miracle that he intended to work, called forth the man with the lame hand,
and said: arise, and stand in the mids of the people. And with that he
arose, and conceived good hope that he should be made wholle. Then Jesus turned
him to the Phariseis, whose secret thoughts he was priuey unto, and said
unto them: What is your opinion which take upon you to know the law? How,
and with what things is the Sabbath day broken? With doing of good deeds, or
of evil? by preseruyng of a man's life, or destroying the same? They knew right
well for what purpose he moved this capcious question. If they had answered
that it had been better for the reverence and solemnity of the Sabbath, to
suffer their neighbor to perish, then without scruple of conscience to help
him in peril and necessity, the people could not have suffered so
unreasonable an answer, clean repugnaunt to the law of nature. Again if
they had said he might lawfully have dooen it, then had they brought
themselfes in case that they could not have charged him with any false surmise
as their entente and purpose was to do. Therefore they thought good to hold
their peace, and say never a word. And yet whiles they so did, they plainly
declared unto the people, their malicious wilines, for that being provoked by
this question to amendment of life, they of an obstinate mind were still
desirous to pick quarrels.

Now to the intent that this question should the easlier be assoyled and
answered to, he put forth another like question, asking whether there were any
among them that kept the sabbath day so high and holy, that if a sheep of his
chanced to fall into a dyche on that day, would suffer it to peryshe, and in
no wise be so hardye as to draw it out. There was none so blind in that
assembly, but he knew right well how much the health of man ought to be
regarded, before the health and preseruacio^ of a sheep. Truly he kills, whosoever
may save that thing which he suffers to peryshe.

Wherefore after the Lord had looked for an answer, and perceived how all the
Phariseis like confederates, not because they were ignoraunte of the truth,
but of an ostinate malice held their peace: he looked round about, and beheld
them, she wyng outwardly with his countenance how wroth and sorye he was,
for their incurable wickedness, who when they took upon the^ to be gydes of the
blind, had themselves hearts so blinded with worldely lusts, that they
willyngly refused to see the most radiant, and clear light of verity. For
there is no blindness more incurable, then when a man is both wittingly, and
willyngly blind. They saw that the dumme beast might lawfully be drawn out
of the hole, lest it should peryshe, without any violacion or breach of the
sabbath, and would in no wise see, that it was like lawful to provide for
man's health upon the same day. Therefore, the most gracious Lord to teach us
that we ought not to withdraw our selfs from helping of our neighbor, for
the incurable frowardnes of the evil (the Phariseis contemned) turned him to
the manne with the withered hand, and in the audience of the people, who were
desirous to see the end of this matter, said unto him: Stretche out thy hand.
That voice was scarcely heard: But he stretched it out suddenly changed, and
serving him as well to do every thing withal, as the other which was never
lame. Whom would not these reasones have converted, and brought from his
error? whom would not so evident a miracle have moved to glorify God? But the
Phariseis infected with the leven of envy, were thereby provoked to imagine
more mischief.

Certes, these are those same corrupt, and always unright judgments of the
Phariseis. They pass more upon a dumme beast, then upon a man: more upon
the apparel, then the body: more upon meat, then life: more upon the body,
then the soul: more upon worldly things, then heavenly things: more upon the
flesh, then the spirit: more upon men, then God. So true is it that there
is no greater mischief in the world, then is perverse and aukewarde holiness.
Among men it is counted to cum of a wonderful virtue, with word only to
restore a man's lame hand, and make it whole again. But it is a much greater
virtue, and benefit, to restore the dead, and lame powers of the soul. What a
pitiful lame hand has he? how dead? how void of all pity and compassion?
who when he sees his neighbor in necessity, does not give him his alms?
when he sees him err and stray out of the right way, does not teach and
refourme him? when he sees him oppressed with injuries, does not help him?
when he sees him idle, does not stir him to good works?

Such hands had the Phariseis, who would rather envy the Lord, then be
restored by him, unto the health of their souls. Such feeble, and weak persons
has the Synagoge. But the church of Christ receives neither deaf, dumme,
blind, feeble, halte, nor lame. Whosoever is diseased, and vexed with any evils,
let him cum into the sight of Jesus, and he shall be cured. He will inspire us
with his holy spirit, and that which was before lame and without life, shall
then be made quick, and alyne again. They that with true faith wholly
commit themselves unto the Lord, do return home cured of their diseases.
Contrariwise, such as trust to their own righteousness, are made wurse by
other men's benefits and good deeds. They that are puffed up with a
Pharifaicall spirit, wylleth well to none, but to themselves. Again such as
have received the spirit of Jesus, go about nothing else but to do good to
all men.

I^ text.
And the Phariseis departed, and strayghtwaye gathered a counsel (with them
that belonged to Herod) against him, that they might destroy him. But Jesus
avoided with his disciples to the sea. And a great multitude followed him from
Galile, and from Iewry and from Jerusalem, and Id^^ea, and from beyond Iordane,
and they that dwelled about Tire and Sydon, a great multitude of men, which
(when they had heard what things he did) came unto him. For as soon as the
Phariseis were departed out of the temple, albeit in the presence of the
people, they durst not speak one word against Jesus, yet now after they had
sent for such as belonged to Herod, to the intent their conspiracy should be
the stronger (for none knew better the feate how to work mischief then the
Herodians) they all laid their heads together, and secretly debated the
matter between themselves, how they might destroy Jesus, whom as they saw
far to excel them in myghtie deeds, so they perceived that it was not
possible for them to disprove him with words. The Phariseis, and such as were
of Herodes retinue, were not lovers and friends together, and yet for to
destroy the author of health, they agreed all in one. O mischievous concord. O
blyndnes, much in deed to be lamented. What shall the priuey traynes of
worldly deceit prevail against him, unto whom nothing is unknown? The
Lord teaching us by his ensample, that we ought many times to give place for a
season to the incurable obstinacy of the evil, lest through farther
prouocacion they becum more mischievous, conveyed himself thence, and went
aside again unto the sea. The going aside of Jesus, is no kinderaunce to the
gospel, but an encreasyng, and furtheraunce of the same. For if so be that the
Pharise is had not driven him away, he would not have cum to the multitude of
the gentiles. Therefore after that Jesus had forsaken the envious and narrow
synagoge, and was gone unto the sea, there came unto him out of every quarter a
great number of people, not only out of Galile but also out of Iewry, yea and
from Jerusalem self, from Id^^ea, and all the countries lying beyond Iordane,
and moreover from such places as bordered on the cities of Tire and Sydon. For
here was made a foreshewe of the church, that should be gathered together of
the Gentiles, because the synagoge did through her unbelief, repel ye Gospel.
Out of all these places there came a great multitude of people, which moved by
the brute that was spread abroad of the marueylouse doctrine, and mighty deeds
of Jesus, drew the^ selves together, and assembled at the sea side. The lord,
who is both bounteous, and rich toward all men, secluded no man, neither
from his doctrine, nor fro receiving the benefit of health. The people were
so eagre and hasty, by reason of the great desire they had to be cured of their
syckenesses: that one of them thruste another out of place, and by force
preased in where Jesus was, to the intent they might at the least ways but
touch him, because that by the only touching of his garmente, diseases were
also cured and put away. There was no difference neither between disease, nor
person, with this mighty and liberal physycian.

For whosoever they were that were troubled with any manner of evils, or
infirmities, the same were furthwith delivered thereof, if it chanced the^ to go
to Jesus. And the selfsame thing we se spiritually done, even in these days.
How many be there out of all the nations of the whole world, and what
detestable vices are they subdued unto, which fly unto him for succor, and
by touch of faith are healed? Furthermore the unclean spirits after they
had seen Jesus, could not abide his puissaunt virtue, but fell down at his
knees and cried out, saying: Thou art even that selfsame son of God, which
was promised to cum. Jesus, who in no wise would suffer the wicked spirits to
disclose him, strayghtly commanded them to keep silence, and in no case to
discry him before the time were cum. His will was to be known unto the world,
by humble and poor persons, unto whom he said: He that hears you, hears
me. He wills us to give no credence at all to wicked spirits, no not so
much as then, when they speak the truth. For this busynes was not done at
all auentures, but God by his high wisdom, ordered every thing with certain
degrees, and procedinges, for our salvation.

Wherefore when Jesus was thrust with the prease of people, anon he commanded
his disciples to prepare him a ship, because he would not be disquieted with
the disordered, and clamorous multitude, which rather desired bodily health,
then the health of their souls, and thronged him rather then touched him.
Such as confessing their disease, go to Jesus with a sincere faith, do touch
him, and are made whole. Again they which troubled as yet with worldly lusts
and desires, cum rushing in with noise and hurly burly, do grieve and greatly
disquiete him: Therefore the disciples who were wont to be familiarly
conuersaunt with the Lord, prepared him a ship of a more pure congregation.
Jesus is better pleased with a few clean, and quiet persons, then with a
great many that are troublesome and unquiet. But yet he so gat him away, that
he nevertheless taught the multitude out of the ship. When thou see Jesus
teaching out of the ship, understand hereby a bishop, preaching to a
multitude of all sorts, which contains christian nouices, and such as have
not as yet the spirit cast out by baptism, both of the Jews and Gentiles.
Happy and blessed are they that do spiritually touch Christ. None touches him
so, but those whom he first touches. For whomsoever he touches, the same are
healed of all their sins: and now being of unquiet persons, made quiet, they
shall be received into the ship of the Church, there to have the continual
fruicion of his company, and always to sit at his table. The ship wherein
Jesus preaches, is very narrow and roumles to unclean and sinful persons,
and contrarily most wide and large, unto such as are in clean life, and
purged of their sins. The Lord refused the publicacion of devils, and avoided
the sinful and unquiet multitude of people. And yet these things evidently
showed that the kingdom of God was cum, into the which both worthy persons
and unworthy, went about violently to enter. Therefore he prepared himself
certain capitaines, which should aid him in claymyng this heavenly
kingdom: so many in number, as should be sufficient to teach so many nations,
as anon after should come full and whole out of all parts of the world, to
profess the Philosophy and doctrine of the gospel: So have the princes of
this world been wont to chose them certain head rulers and capitaines, to
claim, win, enlarge, govern and defend their empires and kingdoms by. It
is requisite that the said rulers be right trusty, wise, polytique, and
diligent, and in especial that they know the king their masters will and
pleasure.

Therefore Jesus (who had oftimes before, because to allure many unto this
doctrine, humbled himself, even to the baseness of the common people, showing
thereby that the teachers of the gospel ought to do the like) Jesus, I say,
now calling forth to the highness of euangelike perfeccion, went up into a
mountain, and called unto him, not every rascal of the multitude, but such as
it pleased him, and those that he had specially chosen and sorted out before
for this office and ministry. For he called not men of great substance, head
rulers and great estates, not priests, Phariseis, or Scribes but poor men,
unlearned persons, and such as were of low degree. For these were mete to
follow him, and to go up to the mountain, from whence whatsoever this present
world has in it worthy admiracion, is contemned: from whence as out of a
nighe place, the voice of the father of heaven, is heard: and to be short, from
whence the glory of immortality, and everlasting life is beholden. They that
were called, obeyed, and came to Jesus being on high. No man can mount up to
this hill, except Jesus call him. For himself is the mountain, unto whom no
man cummeth unless he draw him. This that king of kings, and Lord of rulers,
did chose out twelve head officers and deputies, the which as loyal and
faithful garders of his personage, should never depart from his person, to
the intent, that when the affairs of the gospel so required, he might send
them out as legates for the body, to preach such things, as they had learned
of him their king, and publish abroad their princes commandment throughout
the whole world. Now for as much as they were vile fishers, unlearned persons,
pooremen, and such as in outward apparaunce, showed no point of kinglines,
notwithstanding they promised the kingdom of God, our savior, lest their
authority should have been nothing regarded, gave them a power, that no
princes of this world can give their ambassadoures, the which power was, that
they should in the name of Jesus, heal all manner of diseases, and also put to
flight unclean spirits. The first of these legates or messingers was Simon,
whose name he changed, and called him Cephas, the which word implies as
much as this latin name Petrus, that is to say a rock or a stone, to the
intent that we should learn by the name self, how the chief groundwarke and
foundation of the doctrine of the gospel, And ^^ gave unto Simon to name
Peter. etc.
is an immovable stedfastnes of faith. The second was James the son of
zebede, with his brother John. To these he gave also new names; and they both
were called Boanarges, which is as much to say in the Syrian tongue, as the
sons of thundre: so that their name was a very prophecye to declare that they
should in time to cum, send out of that euangelike hill into all the world,
the thunder of the preaching of the gospel, which should move and stir up
all men's minds to the desire of heavenly things. For like as thunder
sounds from an high: so the preacher of the gospel sounds, and preaches
nothing that is low and carnal, but all that he speaks, is high and
heavenly. Be you penitent, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. This saying is a
thunder clap. For as soon as this word is spoken, every man fears the danger
of lightninge: but there folowethe a shower, and that is: Believe ye the
gospel, and you shall be safe. The fourth legate and messinger was Andrew,
brother unto Peter, the fifth Philip, the sixte Barthelmewe, the seuenthe
Matthew, the eight Thomas surnamed Didimus, the ninth James the son of Alphe,
the tenth Thaddeus, the eleventh Simon of Canaan, the twelfth Judas Iscarioth,
the which betrayed the Lord. By these few basely borne, unlearned, and weak
persons, it pleased the Lord to renew the whole world, lest that man's
wisdom or power, should challenge any praise in this heavenly busynes.

These things thus done in the mountain, to monishe us that in chosyng the
ministres of the gospel we ought in no wi^e to be moved and led with low and
private affeccions, Jesus came down with his elect head officers and they all
together came into a house, as now the familiar friends, and of should with
God. This exaumple was showed to teach us how the teachers of Gods word
should not grutche to descend from their highness or perfeccion, and abase them
selves even to the lownes of the weak, thereby to win very many to their
Lord. Let us also follow Jesus into the house, for this intent, that we may
perfectly know what they ought to hope after, and whereunto to prepare their
minds, who take upon them syncerely to preach the heavenly gospel. And ye
people assembled together again. etc.
The multitude went not up to the mountain. For that thing pertayneth to them
only, whom the lord has chosen out for that purpose. But as soon as Christ and
his disciples were cum down lower, all the whole rablement of people resorted
unto him again, so importunately crying and calling upon him, partly for to
hear his doctrine, and partly to be delivered of their diseases, that the
Apostles had no leisure so much as to eat their meat. There can be no
pleasaunter syghte unto the teachers of the gospel, then when the people
being desirous to learn, do disquiet the priests, then when a great multitude
of christen nouices sytteth round about the church door, then when there is
not room enough in the Churches to receive all manner of folks, that resorteth
unto the bishopes sermon. After that all these deeds were through the great
brute thereof, brought to his kinsefolkes and cosens ears, who knew right well
thinfirmitie of his flesh, whereas for grossness of understanding they could
not suppose any thing of his godly might and power: after, I say, they heard
tell how he wandered up and down with a sort of rascal slouens, and vile
fellows following him at the heles, and heard say also how he caused much
people to follow him, taught new learninges, and such as had not been heard
before, put away diseases, and cast out devils, they ascribed all to fury and
madness: because being offended with the weakness of his body they could in
no wise refer these things unto his godly power. They knew his father and
mother, they knew his house, and all his family: they knew that in all other
things he differed nothing from other, and perceived also how all that was
reported of him, far exceded the compass of man's power.

Wherefore for as much as they were his kinsfolks, they thought it according to
man's law, to be their part and duty to bind him with cheynes, as one
distraughte of his wits and possessed with sum evil spirit. For they said:
he is becum furious or mad. Truly they which contemnyng all erthly things,
For they said: he is mad. etc.
yea and life it self, embrace with all their hearts the heavenly Philosophy
and doctrine, do appear to be beside themselves to those persons, unto whom
nothing sauoureth but that which is earthly, and transitory. He that spends
his liuelode to help the poor at their need, seems mad unto him who has
reposed the aid of this present life in worldly riches. He that willingly
for the ghospels sake upon hope to be rewarded with everlasting blissfulness,
brings himself to banishmente, poverty, emprisonment, torments, and death,
is starcke mad in his opinion, who believes not that there is a more blisfull
life after this present life, ordained for those which are good livers and
virtuous persons. He that sets naught by honors given of princes, and the
people, to thend he may purchasse himself glory with god in heaven, seems out
of his wit unto such as be mad in very deed, whiles that by bribes gyuing,
by craft and deceyte, by hoke or by croke, by right or by wrong, they desire
lordship, sovereign rule, and dignities: the which anon after, they must
needs forgo. And the Lord suffered his kinsfolk to have this wicked opinion
of him, lest that his disciples should be offended if it chanced them at any
time afterward to hear like words of theirs. Howbeit the wickedness of the
Phariseis was more manifest, who were themselves witnesses of these so great
miracles that he wroughte. For his kinsfolks erred rather of a certain
grossness of understanding, naturally given unto the common sort, then of
any obstinate malice, and wickedness. But the Phariseis which came from
Jerusalem (who because of the knowleage they had in the prophets, ought to
have known by such deeds and miracles as they saw him work, that the thing
was already cum and present, which was promised of the same prophets: and
also for the sovereignty of their religion, by reason whereof they highlye
esteemed themselves, ought to have honored gods power, which all men proved
helping and wholesome) the Phariseis, I say, blasphemously spoke against Jesus,
saying: These deeds that he does, be farrre above man's power: howbeit he
does them not by the virtue and power of god, but has sum mighty and notable
devil, by whose aid he works the same. For he has undoubtedly the spirit
of Beelzebub, the master devil of all, and through his help, puts other
devils to flight which are not so strong and mighty. This shameless and
blind blasphemy because it was not only spoken aaginste Jesus (whom they
reckened to be nothing else but a man) but against god himself, whose glory
they envying at, ascribed the miracles that were wrought by his divine power,
unto the unclean spirit the devil, the Lord earnestly reproves: and uses
also certain parables, to the intent that all men should clearly perceive the
mattier.

Since that the whole kingdom of devils, says he, is against the kingdom of
god, how may it then be that Satan casts out Satan? except peradventure
the fiendes make battle, and go together by the ears among themselves: as
though it were like to be true, that they which serve one prince in his
wars, And if a realm be divided against it self: etc.
do violently put one another out of his hold or fortress. If that among
mortal men, that Realm which is divided through sedicion and inward discord
very shortly cummeth to ruin, because like as unity and concord is the
chief keeper and patroness of a Realm, even so discord brings any thing
to destruction be it never so strong, and well fortified: How then shall the
kingdom of Beelzebub endure, if one devil cast out an other? What speak I of
a Realm? Whereas sedicion raygneth, there every thing is so unstable, And if
Satan make insurreccio^ against Satan. etc.
that not so much as a private house can long prosper and continewe, if
thinhabitauntes thereof be at square, and one of them hate an other. Wherefore if
I cast out devils by the help of Beelzebub (as you falsely report, and lay
unto my charge) then is it a sure proof that his kingdom shall shortly cum to
ruin and desolacion: And the kingdom of deuilles once destroyed, what than
remains but that it becumme gods kingdom? But if I (which thing is most
true) do chase away deuilles, enemies to God, and mankind, by gods virtue
and power, then is it evident that the kingdom of God is present, whose power
the finds are compelled maugry of their heads, to give place unto. For they
give not place willingly, or because they have couenaunted so to do. There can
be no leage or covenant between god and the devils. They war continually
together, and can in no wise be reconciled, as it fares when there chances
battle betwixt two very doutye, and courageous Capitaines, which be mortal
enemies, and at utter defiance one with another. Neither of them suffers
himself to be taken of the other, unless it be by strength, and when he is
overthrown in battle. For what courageous and bold Captain will suffer his
enemy to enter forciblie into his house, being right strong, and well
fortified, unless his said enemy win the same by violent assault, and then
cast him, now ouercum and vanquished, into prison, By this means shall he
rifle his house, and carye away with him the spoil and pray. If ye see the
devils cry out, and make a great noise when they are cast out and expelled,
if you see also many forsake their sins wherewith they served the devil, and
cum to the fredome of innocencye, and good living, why do you then take all the
glory from God the conqueror, and give it unto Beelzebub who is conquered and
overcome? Does Beelzebub the enemy of mankind change his old conditions,
and now provide for the health and preseruacion of man? is not this a
manifest blasphemye against God? Be you right well assured of this: there is
no kind of blasphemye, but it may be pardoned of God, because that in all
other blasphemies either ignorance or else the weakness and frayltie of man's
nature, leaves a place for the obtaynyng of forgiveness. But he that
blasphemouselye has spoken against the holy ghost, shall never obtain pardon.
That man speaks blasphemy against the holy ghost, who being hardened and
obstinate through malice, ascribes those works unto the spirit of Beelzebub,
which he sees plainlye cannot otherwise be done, then by the spirit of God.
Error and ignorance are pardonable. But how is it possible that a purpensed
malice against the goodness of almightye God prouokyng us to salvation, shall
get any pardon at all? The weakness of man's body shall excuse such
blasphemy as is committed against the son of man. But to ascribe gods power
(the which plainelye apppeareth in my deeds, to the health and salvation of
mankind,) unto Beelzebub the enemy of God, is a kind of blasphemye, for the
which no amends or satisfaccion can be made.

These words spoke Jesus unto them, defending the fathers glory, and nothing
in the mean while passing upon his own. He meant that their offense might be
better excused and borne withal, which had an evil opinion of him, as his
kynnesfolkes and cosens had, who said: He is becum furious, and prepared
cheynes to bind him withal: then the wickedness of the Phariseis, who of a
certain incurable malice ascribed those works unto the spirit of Beelzebub
which they could in no wise find fault with, nor say but they were worthy
to proceed of God.

They yet perceived not the divine nature that was in Christ. For he would not
as yet have it uttered and known. Certes God has oftimes by virtue of his
holy spirit, and the ministry of good livers, wrought miracles, willing
therefore to be glorified among men. Now if any man not by reason of ignorance,
but of very malice, do ascribe such miracles unto the spirit of Beelzebub,
then is his perverse and malicious naughtines past all hope of amendment. For
they said: he has an unclean spyrite.
Wherefore they might have been excused if they had said that Christ had been
nothing else but a man, or that he had been no king, nor Messiah. But in that
they depraved and spoke ill of his works, they offended God and his holy
spirit, in as much as the spirit of god can work by whom soever it lusts.
Now when they saw so many miracles merueylousely wrought, the people glorify
God, so many helped of their infirmities, so many delivered of unclean
spirits, so many turn from viciously^ing, to a godly desire, to live well and
vertuousely after the gospel, and that by the preaching of Christ: yet they
obstinately said, he has a devil, and not the spirit of god.

After the Lord Jesus had with these, and many other words defended the glory
of the heavenly father against the wicked blasphemy of the Phariseis, and
imbrayded the Jews with their obstinate, and incorrigible unbelief, which
they perseuered in notwithstanding that through faith alonly al sins are
^ewsed and forgeuen: in the mean time there befell occasion for him also to
declare that in the high ministracion of the ghospel, there ought no regard at
all to be had to humayne affeccions, the which in other mattiers to be much
moved by, is counted a thing praise worthy, and right commendable. For there
came unto him his kynsfolkes in company with his mother, who because there was
no way for them to enter in for prease of people, stood without: and their
voice passing from man to man, came unto them that sat about Jesus, who
showed him how his mother and brethren were cum, and desired to speak with
him. There were sum, even among his nere kinsemen, which had an evil opinion
of him, yea and many of them supposed he had been out of his wit. Yet they
thought by reason of kindred, they might lawfully at any time when they would,
call him out to speak with them. The Lord, to teach us that the business
of the gospel, which was done by the spirit of the father for man's
salvation, and gods glory, Who is my mother and my brother: etc.
ought not to be left of for any affeccions humayne, answered as though he had
been angrye, and in a great fume saying: who is my mother, and who are my
brethren, and kinsfolks? In this business which I have now in hand, I
knoweledge no fleshlye kyndred. The gospel has a spiritual kindred of
frown, the which joins together men's minds with streighter bonds then
does the other their bodies. And when he had looked round about on his
disciples, who sat in compass next him, as he was teaching, he said: Behold
these are my brethren, and my mother. As the gospel makes a new birth, so
does it also a new kindred. For whosoever believes the gospel, and therein obeys
the will of my heavenly father, although he be not only fardest from me, as
touching kindred of stock or family, but also ye strangest alyaunte that is,
to all our nation, the same is my brother, the same is my sister, the same is
my mother. For this kynred is not esteemed after the degrees of blood, but by
degrees of ye spirit. I acknowledge none to be of my kindred, except he be
borne afresh of the heavenly father through faith, and then as a very natural
son, do obey his father when he calls him to everlasting things. As
every man will in most perfect wise perform this, so shall I take him for
my nerest kinseman.

The.iiij. Chapter.

THerefore Jesus forsook the house which bare the figure of the Sinagoge,
wherein he was blasphemed of the Phariseis, and interrupted through
thimportunacie of his kinsfolks: and eftsoon went unto the water, as one that
desired the large room of the Gentiles. He is often times expelled of the
Jews: he makes oftetimes a foresigne that the gospel shall be tran^sted from
the Jews unto the Gentiles. For as long as he was in the house, that is to
say, in Iewry, very few did stick unto him, none but those only whom he
calls his brethren, his systers and his mothers.

Many muttered against him, many rayled upon him, very many lay in wait for
him, and his nerest kinsfolks of all interrupted him in his teaching. Jesus
loves no such houses. He loves a multitude, not ye stands in their own
conceyte, as the Phariseis did, not that uses to backebite, and make ill
report of their neighbor, as did his kinsfolks (who being gross of capacity
through fleshly wisdom, interpreted his heavenly wisdom to be nothing else but
fury and madness) not that moved by worldly affeccions do cause a man to leave
of any godly enterprise or business as his mother, and kinsfolks did. He
loves a multitude which is desirous to hear ye gospel, and word of God,
And there gathered together etc.
and wholly hangs upon the ^eliefe thereof. Wherefore when the Lord Jesus was
cum unto the sea, and there taught as he did before, thither assembled again a
great number of people, insomuch that he was constrained through the noise and
hurly burly they made, thrusting one another out of place, to take aboate: out
of the which, as it had been out of a pulpet, he taught them sytting thick
together on the shore, as if it had been in a round stage or place ordained for
men to behold sightes and shows in. Learn here thou art a preacher and
teacher of the gospel, what is meant by this figure. Avoid thou so the
rablement of clamorous, and unquiet people, that yet thou cease not to do thy
duty in preaching and teaching of gods word. When there is any ieopardy
lest thou be thrust down, and overwhelmed with ye trouble of worldly
business so that thou can not now teach, get the into the ship of the
gospel, which knows no manner of earthly rufflyng, and out of that pulpit,
thou shalt quietly teach the weak, and rude multitude. Go not far from the
shore: be nigh unto the same, always atte^peryng thy ^se as much as thou can,
unto ye capacity of the people. For they are not as yet able to follow the.
First of all thou must attempre thy doctrine, according as their rude and
ignorant minds can away withal, till such time that they have well
profited therein. For whom did Jesus teach out of the boat, but a rude and an
unlearned multitude of all sorts of people.

He put forth unto them parables, that is to say, similitudes of things most
known to all men. For this is the playnest manor of teaching and most
conuenable for the rude, insomuche that it appears at the first sight to the
wise of this world, a chyldishe thing, and to be laughed at.

But yet this manoure of teaching, pleased the everlasting wisdom. The
Philosophers made all things dark unto their hearers, with arguments fourmed
by great art and subteltie. The Rhetoricians enforced men's minds, with a
meruaylous plentifulnesse of eloquent speech. The Phari^^^ gathered together
certain hyd misteryes, far excedyng the capacity of the vulgar people. But
the Lord chose unto him this kind of doctrine as plainest, and far from all
manor of playerlike ostentacion, to the intent that all the glory gotten by
renewing of the world through the gospel, should wholly appertain, and be
ascribed to the might and power of God. Wherefore he moved them by many
parables to receive with sincere belief and clean minds, the doctrine of the
gospel: from whence the beginning of our salvation proceeds. And because it
behooved to have this thing fast settled and printed in all their minds, before
he began to teach them, he commanded them diligently to attend and hear
what he would say.

Harken (quod he) if any have ears to harken withal. It is a fable, and not
a parable, except a man give ear thereunto. Neither has every manne cares to
hear the parables of the gospel, which are subtelly plain, wyselye
folishe, and darkely manifest. For they hyde heavenly wisdom underneath a vile
and folyshe coueryng. Neither thought Jesus it sufficient if they gave diligent
ear: he would also they should behold and see with their iyes those things
that he purposed to say. Blessed are they that have both pourged ears, and
clear iyes, when Jesus speaks. Behold, says he, there went out into the
field a certain sowier to sow his sede, the which he had very pure, and
good. And whiles that desirous of plentiful increase, he cast it every where,
it chanced that sum of it fell by the hye way side, which joined unto the
fyelde. And that sede, because it remained still above ground, by reason the
way was hard and seere, the fowls that thither came anon after picked up, and
devoured. Again an other portion thereof, fell upon a stonye ground, which
because there lay many stones underneath, covered with a little moulde or
duste, sprang up to tymely. For the warmenesse of the weather, brought it out
of the ground. And anon as the heat of the Sun waxed once feruente, the
corn that thus sprang up before due season, was hurt, and partched therewith.
And because it could not for stones take rootyng but lacked roots to draw
moisture out of the deapth of the earth, therewith to nourishe, and defend it
against the heat of the sun, it widdered away before it came to earing.
Again an other portion of this sede fell upon a ground, the which in deed
was rank and fertyle, but yet ouergrowen with thorns, And sum fell among
thorns.
and briers. Now when these thorns were once grown very thick in height and
breadth, it came to pass that the young corn, which sprang thereof, was
smothered before it appeared in sight, not for want of moisture, but for lack
of air. And for this cause neither had the sowier any profit hereof at all.
But yet for all this, the labor of the same sowier was not utterly frustrate,
and in vain. For there was sum of the sede that light upon a good ground,
and thereof sprang grass, the which grew, and waxed until it came to it full
ripeness. And of this sede there was not one unfruitful grain,
notwithstanding that al yielded not like increase: For there were many ears
which of one grain, yielded thirty, sum other three skore, and a great sort
and hundred.

When the Lord had spoken these words, then to the intent they should not be
forgotten, but that every man should search out with himself the meaning of
the parable, he said moreover: He that has ears to hear, let him hear:
declaring undoubtedly hereby, that they all heard not that thing which they
heard. Now when not those twelve specially chosen disciples themselfes
understood well (by reason they were as yet raw and ignorant) what this
similitude meant: yet durst they not openly ask him any question. But after
they had once gotten him alone, then were they hold to desire him that he
would vouchesafe the expound them the mystery, and secret meaning thereof.

To you is it given to know the mysteries of etc.
Then Jesus putting us in remembrance how all things are not to be disclosed
to all persons, but that the doctrine of the gospel ought to be dispensed
according as time serves, and the capacity of the hearers can away withal,
said unto his disciples: The princes of this world make few privy unto their
secrets, none but such as are pycked fellows, and tried persons, whom they
may safely make of their counsel. If they have any secret thing, that keep
they from the knowleage of the comminaltie. It is given unto you (whom I sorted
and piked out from among the commune people) to know the mystery or priuitie
of the kingdom of heaven, because you are familiarlye conuersaunt with me. But
unto the commune sort, and such as are not familiar companions of my court,
But unto the^ that are without, al things, etc.
whether I do, or speak any thing, all is in parables. For they neither have
meet ears, nor meet iyes.

What they hear, they believe not: what they see they deprave, and find fault
with. And so is verified in them that the prophet said before should cum to
pass, that when they see best, yet see they not, and when they hear best, yet
they hear not: because they understand not. Truly he understands not, whosoever
believes not. Now sins are not released, but to such as believe that sins
are freely released by virtue of the gospel. Therefore through their unbelief,
it cummeth to pass that they are not turned to God, because they turn
themselfes away from God, nor are delivered from their sins, because they
refuse the medicine wherewith all sins are healed. And he said unto them:
know ye not this; etc.
By these words Jesus signified those persons, whom a little before he
understood by the ground that for sundry causes is barrayne and unfruitful.
And to make his disciples more apt to receive his doctrine, he chideth them a
little for their dullness. Do you not yet, says he, guess what is mente by
this parable, since the sense thereof is easy to be coniectured? And how then
will you boulte out the true meaning of all the rest, since that I neither
speak, nor do any thing that has not in it a significacion of sum secret
matier? I will expound unto you this parable to the intent that you may
likewise accustom your selfs to search out the secret meaning that lies
hyd in other.

The field is the world, wherein are very many unmeet hearers of the doctrine
of the gospel. The sowier is the son of man, who came down from heaven into
earth. The sede is the word or doctrine of the gospel, by the which the
will of God is declared unto the world. His will is this, that all men
distrusting their own strength, do trust with all their heart and mind the
promises of the gospel: that is to say, that through faith all men's sins
are forgeuen: if after the truth once known they give themselfes to the
study of true virtue, and godliness. Therefore by the seed which, as I
said, fell by the hie way side, they are understand, and signified, who
slightly, and as me^ otherwise occupied, hear the gospel, like as they
would hear any fable or fantasy of man's inuencio^. And among all, none
hears gods word with less profit, And likewise the other that receive
sede. etc.
then they do. For anon as they have heard it, cummeth Satan, and puts other
thoughts, and imaginacions in their minds, and by that means plucketh out
the sede before it have gotten root, and be fastened therein, so yt they do not
so much as remember what they have heard. Now the sede that is received into
a stony ground, betokens those persons who gredely enough hear the ghospel,
and gladly devour the same, perceiving it to be both true, and holsum: but
because they ley it not up in their hearts by deep cogitacion, (for they are
let so to do by other affeccions, which wholly possessing their minds, will
in no wise give place unto ye word of God) they continue not in that they
fervently and courageously began: neither do they bring forth any fruit of
euangelike or christian godliness, but such fruit alonely as lasts but for
a season and all is, because they have no roots. And so cummeth it to pass,
that in prosperity they believe the gospel, and as grass newly spro^g up,
cause men to have a good opinion of them, that they will prove well. But as soon
as any adversity or persecucion for the profession of gods word does
arise, and assault them, byanby they offended therewith, do utterly forsake
their former purpose. There be other also that, etc.
The seed that fell upon the thornie ground, signifies those that diligently
hear, and bear in mind the words of the gospel: But the love of
deceitful riches, and the inordinate desires of other things which allure
and toil men unto them, with a false apparaunce of virtue, do enter into their
minds, and there daily (as their property is) encreasyng, at the length
ouergrowe the seed, so that it can never spring up, and cum to be corn.
Finally the sede that light upon a good ground, betokens those that give good
ear unto the doctrine of the gospel, and believe all that they hear, and
convey it into the most inward corners of their hearts, until that it spring
up, and bring forth the worthy fruits of the gospel, not every where a
like, but diuerselye, according to the diuersytie of the soil, and disposicion
of the heavenly spirit: so that this men brings forth fruit meanly, that
man more plentifully, an other greatest abundance thereof: like as if one
grain bring forth thirty, an other three score, and the third an hundred.
He that brings forth great plentifulnesse of fruit has cause to render
thanks unto God almighty: there is no cause why he should stand in his own
conceit. He that brings forth mean store, has no cause to repyne at him
which is much happier, and brings forth more abundance then he. For God,
who is bound and debtour to no man, does of his most bounteous liberality,
give every man his gifts, as it likes him. What increase soever cummeth,
the same is due unto him that first sowed the ground, and by whom what fruit
soever is brought forth, dayle increases. My desire is to have all the corn
ground of the whole world sown when the time shall cum, with this sede: and
that this doctrine, which I now secretly teach you a few persons, may
thorough your dilligent ministry, be enlarged and spredde a broad, as much as
may be, to ye intent that you also may show your selfs, like a good ground,
if you distribute that you have received of me, to as many as ye can possible.
For there is no fruit where with God is better pleased. Ye must therefore be
well ware, that the sede sown in your minds, peryshe not through
forgetfulness, or negligence. Ye ought diligently to lay it up in memory
that it may spring up in due season, and bring forth fruit most plentifully.

And because this monicion should the depeliar be printed in their minds, he
added a parable. Think you not, said he, yt I will have this thing which I
do now secretly commit unto you, always kept secret. Does a man light a
candell because to hyde the same when it is lighted, underneath a busshell, or
under the table? or else does he rather light it to the intent it may be set
in a candlestick, For there is nothing privy. etc.
and give light to all that be in the house? The gospel is the sede, which
is therefore committed unto you, because it may bring forth fruit with great
increase. I have light the candell in you, that through your ministry, it
may put away the darkness of the whole world. At this present I hyde many
things from the multitude, because they are not as yet apt to receive them:
and though they were, the time is not yet cum. But as soon as the time shall
once cum, there is nothing so hid amongst us that then must not be discovered,
nor any thing so secret, that then must not be openly preached to all men.
For there must nothing fear you from spreading abroad, or preachinge of the
gospel: but all other things set apart, this thing only must you go about
both day and night. For woe be to that man, who has not multiplied ye good
sede betaken unto him: who has hidden the light that was given him. Therefore
if any of you have ears to hear, let him hear these words: and when he has
heard them, let him bear them well in memory. Agaule left the words that he
spoke, should be forgoten, he said moreover: Mark well what thing you hear,
and take heed that you hear not in vain. For you hear not vain fables and
fantasies of m^ns inuencion, but heavenly doctrine: which by your ministry,
must be spread abroad throughout all the whole world. Preach you truly the
doctrine which you have received, and teach nothing that is desagreable
thereunto. It shall avail you much to hear these things, if you retain them
well in memory and diligently distribute to other what you hear of me. Again
you hear the^ to your great peril, if you strike^ either with fear human,
or else delited with the commodities and pleasures of this present world, do
suppress and keep in, that you have received. Be not ye niggish, And unto you
yt have shall more be given. etc,
and slouthful distributours of the doctrine that I give you, I give you, but
put it forth lauishly. For your liberality shall nothing diminishe, but rather
increase that, that you have, and make it more. The treasure of gold and silver
is at the length wasted by liberality: but the more liberally you distribute
this heavenly treasure, the greater shall the heap thereof be. Neither
follows it that like as he is the poorer that gives a way his goods unto the
neadie, so in like manor is he the wurse learned which distributeth the
doctrine of the gospel to as many as he can possible: but as he that carries
light before many, has not therefore any whit the less light him self: even
so he that by preaching the doctrine of the gospel, openethe a way for all
men to cum to the knowleage of the truth, does not only not loose that
light which he already has, but also has a great deal more given him, to
thentent he may profit, and do good unto mooe. The treasure that you have,
is none of youres, but his who gave it you to distribute. And if you distribute
it to other with large measure, he that gave you the stock and principal
part, will also with like measure give you increase thereof. God loves to have
his gifts prodigallye laid out: and here clean contrary to the manoure of
worldly riches, he waxes richest, whosoever is lauishest in laying out.

For such is the beneficial goodness of god, that he which gave us much
before ^^eth in most ample wise augmente his gifts, because he right well
percei^^ that whatsoever was given, the same is distributed and bestowed to the
great utility of many. Therefore let him which has the gift, bountuouslye
distribute it, to thentente that he may have abundance. No man does well
to give goods to him that abounds with riches: but such as be liberal in
very deed, For unto him yt has etc.
are wont to give unto the poor, and neadie. Here it is cleanen contrarye^.
For unto him that has, and has not that thing which he has to his own
use and commodity alone, but liberallye departs therewith to other, to him,
I say, as to a trusty distributour, shall more be given: because he may
abound, and have much plentye. He that has not (such a one is he that
hydeth his treasure, and keeps it to himself) the same shall not alonely be
never a whit the richer therefore, but also that thing which he thought he had
for his own use, and no man's else, shall be quite taken from him. Neither let
this make you ever the slacker or worse willing to distribute the gifts of
faith, if the people be unkind, and not aunswerable to your diligent
endeavor. Your wages shall be safe for you with God, who the more that every
one of you has trauayled in setting forth the gospel, the more bounteously
will he reward him in the world to cumme. Albeit neither shall you in the
mean time be utterly defeated of your reward, which are daily more and more
enriched with the riches of the gospel.

Moreover the Lord added another parable, whereby he taught his disciples
that they should care for nothing else, but only go about with all that they
might, to have the gospel spread abroad and preached through out all the whole
world, tellyng them that harvest time should once cum, when it should please
the Lord. The kingdom of the gospel, says he, is after this manor, as if a man should sow his sede, and cast it upon the ground in the day time,
Anon after that the sede is put into the earth, he that sowed it, slepethe
careless, and takes his rest. And in the mean while that he is thus a
sleep, the sede grows nevertheless both night and day, with secret
encreasynges without men's labor, and now springs ye corn, and shoteth
up, hasting undoubtedly of the own accord, and by a certain privy
operacion of nature to bring forth fruit.

Certes nature has her degrees, the which she always after the seed be once
sown, keeps of course without the husbandmannes labor. For first of all
the sede, after it is putrified in the ground, springethe up into grass. That
is the first hope of increase. Then when the blade is shot up, thereunto
grows an ear, but such a one as has as yet no corn in it. At the length
the husks of the ear are filled full of wheat corns. And these things are
so secretly wroughte by the procurement of nature, that a man can not perceive
when they grow, and yet senu^blye perceive that they have grown and increased.

Therefore when the corn is ripe, he that sowed the sede, thrusts in his
sickell to reap that is come up, because he knowethe that harueste time is
already come. By this dark parable, the Lord covertly taught his disciples
the beginning, going forward, and consummacion or perfect code of al ye whole
gospel: of the which three parts, himself would openly perform both ye
first, and the last, with his visible body: and the other, that is to say,
the going forward, order with the invisible grace of the holy ghost. For that
same prince sowed abroad the sede of the gospel, through out all Iewry. Anon
as he had so done, he slepte, first dyinge, and then afterward risinge again
into everlasting quietness. And thus far forth springs the sede of the
gospel, whiles he that first sowed it, is as it were a sleep: and secretly
encreasethe both day and night, that is to say, both in prosperity, and in
adversity, what oc^asion soever be ministered either on their befalfe that
promote and advance it or else of such as resist the same.

For it cannot be chosen but that seed must needs cumme up, which he sowed,
whose will no man resists. Moreover, where as there is nothing in this
world unknown unto him, yet in that he suffrethe the world to make business
against the gospel, and his apostles to be persecuted, and slain, he
semethe unto the faythlesse not to know what is here done, and to be in manner
aslepe, whereas in very deed, he does even now by the invisible power of his
holy spirit, more effectually work all things in all. He will not in visible
form return into the world, until the time that (the gospel being
first so much enlarged, and spread abroad, as he has determined before, and
only knowethe it shall be) all men shall see him cum again under the self
same form and lykenes, that he had when he ascended up into heaven: to divide
the godly and good people from the wicked: and to lay up the godly as good
corn in the barn of everlasting quietness. We see how small begynnynges the
kingdom of the gospel is spronge of, if a man esteem the thing as it
appears unto the world. This was, as a man would say, the grass that
sprange of the sede of the gospel, which the Phariseis, Scribes, Priests,
Elders, Rulers, Princes, Kings, and Philosophiers, did what they could to
oppress and keep under, that it should never cum up. But whiles they strove
against the stream, this sede began to be sown in all parts of the world,
and will not cease to grow before the worlds end, until the corn be all
ripe. Then the sickell of judgment that can not be avoided, shall be thruste
in, to the entente that when all are cut down, it may deliver the cockel unto
the fire, and safely lay up the pure wheat.

This parable although it do specially pertayne unto Jesus, the auctour,
promotour, and finisher of the kingdom of the gospel, yet does it also
touch both his Apostles, and their successoures, whom he wills wholly to
bind themselves hereunto, that Gods word may be sown a broad, and
preached as much as may be. For this seedetyme lasts even till the worlds
end: and they also as helpers of Jesus Christ, be sowiers, save alonelye that
they sow not their own sede, but such as Christ delivered unto them. And
because that sede is celestial, it can in no wise be ouerlayed or oppressed.
The Pharisess also, and Philosophiers had sede of their own, but those seeds
could by no means (no not when the world favored them) grow and prosper,
where as the seed of the heavenly doctrine, waxes every day more stronger
then other, even when the world with all the puissaunce and aids that it
has, assaulteth it. Therefore the Apostles do likewise sow after their
fashion, and for that purpose they are sent out, who by often removing from
place to place, go about nothing else, but to have the gospel as much dilated
and spread abroad as is possible to be. God gives the increase when they be
asleape. That foresaid sede has in every one, even of the Christians, his
grass, his ear, and his harvest. In him that is a Christian nouice, the corn
is yet imperfect, and lacks his natural shape.

In them that be lately borne again in Christ through baptism, the sede is
sprongen into grass, which by ye grenenes of innocence, puttethe every manne
in a ioyefull hope that it will prove well, and come to good. Now when they
are grown up higher, by going forewarde in Christian virtue and godliness,
then be they eared.

And when each of them is ripe after his manoure, then is he cut down with
the sickle. This sickle is death, after which the wheat neither waxethe more
ne less: neither is made worse, nor better. The barn signifies the life
celestial.

Furthermore, the Lord Jesus showed them by another parable, a figure of the
success and prosperous going forward of the Gospel, to the entente that
they, who as then understood not his sayings, should afterward know by the
end and proof of the matter that these things were not dooen at all
adventures, nor by worldly policy, but by the providence of Gods wisdom.
And because he would make his hearers to take better head unto his words, It
is like a grain of mustarde seed.
he lettynge as though he had stand in doubt unto what thing he might best
compare the kingdom of heaven, said: Unto what thing shall we say that the
kingdom of heaven is like? or what comparison shall I use, whereby I may
express the nature and virtue thereof, unto the^ that perceive nothing save
alonely what they see with their iyes? It is like (safethe he) a gra^^e, or
corn of mustarde seed, which (when it is sown) is less then all other
seeds of herbs that are sown in the earth: in so much that if a man mark
the quantity or form thereof, he looks not that any great thing should
come of it. But as soon as the same is once spronge up, and gotten out of the
ground, then draws it to the nature of a tree, waxyng hard from the stem
or stalk, and spreadyng abroad his branches beyond the quantity and measure
of al other herbs, in so much that it gives shadow unto the fowls, and
also convenient places for them to build and make their nestes in. With these
and many other like parables, And with many such parables. etc.
the Lord Jesus showed the rude and gross people, a figure of the success
that the Gospel should have, attemperynge his words unto their capacities.
He spoke nothing unto them at that time but in dark parables, because they
were not as then receyueable of plain communicacion. For if he had said, that
he should shortly have been slain of the Jews, but would anon after
reliue, and spread abroad his glory throughoute all the world, so that he,
who then seemed loweste, and most abiecte of all persons, should be right
well known to be the soueraygne gouernoure of the whole world, and that no
manns, were he never so high in dignity, should find any quietness, or
sure harborowe, unless he fled for succoure underneath his boughs or
branches: if he had, I say, spoken thus plainelye unto them, not one of them
all would have abyden his words, nor given any credence thereunto. And yet
was it very expediente for them, as it were by a dream, to remember these
things: because afterward the thing self should teach them what was
meante by the same parables. He showed them in secret communicacion, the
secret understanding of every parable that he spoke unto them. Thus was that
day spente. When it was now almost night, he commanded his disciples to
row him over to the other side of the water.

Because faith toward Christ, But when they went alone, etc.
and by Christ to Godwarde, is the original cause of the increase of the
gospel: the Lord perceiving that his disciples (who were as yet but rude, and
weaklynges,) did give no tredence unto his doctrine, attempted many ways to
bring forth in them, and stablishe this faith. Whenever night, that is to
say, the storm of worldly trouble, or adversities cummethe upon us, then
have we chiefelye need of a strong and steadfast faith toward Christ.
Therefore the disciples obeyed his commandment, and so after the people,
(who could not follow him) were sent away, they, accompanied with certain
other boats, began to row him over to the farther side, in the same ship
that he then taught and preached in. The Apostles carye over Jesus, whenever
they go from place to place, to set forth and preach the Gospel. He
knew right well that against such as so do, and be ministers of Gods
word, there should in time to cum be much sore business and trowble stirred
up, by them that love better the vanities of this world, the^ those things
that appertain to everlasting salvation.

Wherefore to harten, and strengthen his disciples against such persecutours,
and to teach them also, that no power, be it never so cruel and terrible,
ought to be feared of those that with full heart and mind put their affiau^ce
in the lord Jesus, he suffered them to be in danger, even to desperacion. For
after they had sailed far from the shore, there suddenly arose a great
storm of wyndes, which set the water in such a rage, that the waves enforced
by the violence of the tempeste, dashed into the ship, so that they were then
in great danger, lest the ship already filled with the great fourges of the
sea, would have soncken. In the mean while Jesus laid his head upon a
pillowe, and slept in the ship. This was no feigned sleep: he slepte in very
deed, being weryed with travail, and watchynges, as one that had a very
natural body of man, subject to all such passions as ours are subject
unto. But he was not ignorant what would betyde. He wyste well there would a
tempest arise. He knew that the Apostles would be sore afraid, and waken him
out of his sleep. He could not more effectuallye teach them, that nothing is
to be drad of those that steadfastly believe in him. The disciples therefore
pinched him as he slepte, and when they had awakened him, said: Master
slepeste thou so soundely while we perish? and thynkest thou that it makes no
matter to the, if we be drouned? It was an argument of faith, that when they
were in danger of death, they fled unto Jesus for succor: But of an imperfect
faith, for as much as they believed that they were not in sufficient
safegarde, as long as the Lord was aslepe. When Jesus was wakened, because he
would by deed declare that he was the Lord of all the elements, he rebuked
the wyndes, and commanded them to cease. Then he said unto the sea: peace, be
still. These two elements which are obediente to no mortal man, knew the
voice of their maker. And by and by the wind alayed, the waves and fourges of
the water left their ragyng, and fell down, and there followed a great calm.
Then the Lord turned him unto his disciples, and rebuked them for their
unbelief. Why (quod he) are ye so afraid? have you not yet, after yt you have
seen me work so many miracles, confydence in me? Now when the disciples, and
the other that were with him in the ship, saw this strange wonder, how the
sea being a dumme, and an unruly element, and the wind likewise a violente
elemente, forthwith as he had rebuked the^, ceased from further ragyng, and
were still: perceiuyng that it was a thing passing the state, and condition
of man, said one of them to another. Who is this whose commandments not
only diseases, and the diuils, but also the dumme elements obey unto?

He that was ye son of man (as touching the natural appetites of man) had
not in this world where to rest his head. For eue^ dying on the cross when
he had nothing to lay his headen, he cast it down, and so yielded up the
Ghost: But here in the ship he did not only take his rest, but also laid a
pilowe underneath his head, and slepte thereon: and anon a storm arose,
because we should know what great danger hangethe over the church, so often
as Christ sleapeth in us. He slepethe verily, when the shepeheardes and
pastors of Christ's flock, delited with the commodities, and pleasures of
this world, are in a sound sleep, so that if a man pynche them, or cry upon
them ^^^er so much, yet can they not be wakened. How fast aslepe are those
Bishops, who being altogether given unto sensuality, dronken with an unlawful
desire to rule and play the lords, and wholly set to heap up money, neither
take any care for the flock to them committed, nor have any remembrance of
their own soul health, nor yet are moved any whit at all with the common
peril, to awake out of their sleep, and think thus with themselves? What do I
mad man that I am? The Lords flock is committed unto me to be fed: and
shortly must I cume to ye iudgyng seat of ye everlasting judge, who shed his
precious blood for these sheep, which he put me in ^ruste withal. What
answer shall I than make him? I should with ensample of good living have
carried light before them to everlasting salvation: and by my naughtye
sinful life, I have been their guide to hell, and damnacion. I should have
fed them with the doctrine of ye gospel, and did not feed them a whit, but
plucked of their woolle by the roots: but spoiled them of that they had, but
slew them. Instead of a father, I behaved my self like a tiran^t, for a
Byshope, I was a wolf and a robber. And in the mean while the tempest
disordereth all things, and makes a great confusion. Jesus, who is the true
heardman of the churches and congregacions, slepethe dissembling the matter,
and sufferyng the storm to arise: but he slepeth so, that he streighte ways a
wakethe at the cry, and calling of his. The ship that Christ (as
pertainynge to the body) is carried in, is one: but she has mo accompanyinge
her. There is one catholic or universal church, and again there be many
churches. Christ is likewise in them all: And as many as do clean unto the
same head, be^ne congregation. No ship is drouned that follows Christ: Be
they never so much tossed with ye waves of the water, never so much in
ieopardie of drownyng, yet have they at the length good ariuall, and cum safe
unto the haven. But all this while, the tempeste and night do plainly teach
us that we can have no manner of aid and succor of our own strength, and
that all hope of salvation is in Christ only, if a man with full heart and
mind put his trust in him. The deuel causes oftetymes such tempests
privately to arise in every man's soul. For after that the night does once
darken our minds with errors: after the light of faith does fail, and the
strength of theuangelike spirit, be (as ye would say) a sleep, and laid to
rest in us: then do the winds of naughtye lusts arise, and greatly disturb
the calm of the mind. The soul self is now in great hasarde: there is no
help, neither in rowing nor in sails. There is no remedy, but it must needs
perish and go to wrecke, if Christ be not wakened out of his sleep by
feruente and importune prayers. If he hear not straight ways when he is
called on, yet cease thou not, but prick, and pinche him till he be a wake. By
him only the calm and quietness of the mind, shall in continent be restored.

The.v. Chapter.

AS this tempest has taught us that all trouble and business whatsoever the
world would stir up against the gospel, ought by the aid of Christ to be
suffered with constant courage of mind: and that such trouble should at one
time or another, be turned into greattest tranquillity and quietness: So
followed therein co^tinent a figure, whereby was fignified yt there should be in
sum parts of the world so vplandishe and cruel people, that they would at
the first brunte by reason of their natural cruelty, refuse and abhor the
doctrine of the gospel: and yet should it cum to pass in process of time,
that they also should wax ientle or cyuille, and lovingly receive the sweet
yoke of the lord after they once knew it. Wherefore as soon as this storm was
alayed, which fygured the storm of persecucion that princes should stir up
raging against the gospel, Jesus, and such as accompanied him, arrived on
the other side of the water.

That country was called the country of the Gerasites of a famous town of
Arabie, named Gerasa, ioynynge unto mount Galaad, in the tribe of Manasse, not
far fro the lack or sea of Tiberias. For now the Lord Jesus makes a
foreshew of the brutishe, and cruel barbarousnesse of certain nations, of
whom it may be doubted, And when he was cum our of the ship. etc.
whether they deserve to have the name of men, or no: yet is there none so
fierce and saluage cruelty that we ought to despair of. Wherefore after that
Jesus was cummen out of the ship, and entered into this country, by and by he
saw a sight, which plainly declared the manners, and natural disposicion of
that nation. For when he was heard cummyng, there starte out a certain
fellow, vexed with a spirit of passinge uncleanness, and cruelty. This
wretched creature would not come where as any resort of people was, but lived
in solitarye places, lurkynge, and hydynge himself in dead men's tumbes that
were by the high way side. Neither was there any that assayed any more to
bind him, because he had been often times bound before, and always plucked
the cheines asunder, and brake the fetters in pieces.

Neither was there any violence that could so reclaim him, but that he being
in case not able to rule himself, would gad abroad at liberty, whithersoeuer
the wicked find enforced him to go. For this cause he was unbound, and
wandered up and down both night and day among dead men's tumbes, and in wild
mountains, criyng and beatyng himself with stones. Now if any reken this to
be (as it is in very deed) a miserable, and a terrible sight, let him
considre with himself, how much more miserable a sight in the iyes of
almighty god, is he that has nothing else of a man, but the name only: He, I
say, that is marde and cast a way through riottous living, wood upon
harlottes, mad upon the dise, and beside himself by reason of dronkennes, a
brauler, a robber or pray taker, a breaker of the peace, a violent fellow,
such a one as can neither be restrained by Gods law, ne man's: neither
let, and brideled from his sensual wilfulnes by any shame, reverence, or
fear: bold to do what him lyketh: who for small wages is hired to go to what
warfare soever it be, to sley and murder such as he knowethe not and never did
him harm, to burn vilages and good tounes, to rifle churches, and fynallye to
destroy all that ever holy is, or not holy. Put hereunto periuries,
blasphemies, and inceste, with the which vices such leude ruffians as are of
this sort, be well acquainted. Put hereto treasons and poysonynges, with the
practice of art Magike or Sorcerye, and then shalt thou evidently perceive
how much less was the furye of the man thus vexed with the devil, then of
this wretched and unthrifty caytife. But what? Ought we to despair of such a
one? No truly, if it may chance him at any time to see Jesus. He is seen by
faith. For when the same wretched fellow at the noise that the strangers made,
was come out of his denn, violently to assault them according unto his
accustomed manner, anon as he had afar of espied Jesus, he drawn with an
heavenly power, and suddenly changed, ran unto him, and wurshypped him. And
straight ways the fiende began to cry with a loud voice by the man's mouth,
and say: What have thou to do with me Jesus the son of the higheste God? I
require thee by the name of God, that thou tourmente me not. For he said unto
him etc.
For Jesus voice was unto that devil, a tourmente, because he said: Thou
foul spirit depart out of the man. So great was the malice of the devil,
that it was the greatest tourmente to him that might be, if he now ^^lde no
longer be suffered to vex and tourment the sely wretch. He felt Jesus voice
effectual, and almighty, the which he was constrained to obey unto, whether
he would or no.

Now I report me to you, whether there be not like affeccion of mind in
such as be extremely malicious persons, who have a great delyght to do other
men harm, yea, though it be to their own displeasure. And if they be
restrained from their wilful desire, so that they can not be suffered to do
what mischief they would, then are they sore vexed in mind. Jesus demanded
of the foul spirit what was his name. The spirit made answer: my name is
Legion, because we be many. Thou know (good reader) that this word Legion,
is a word or term of war, which implies a foul rablement of ruffions
confedered together, to destroy me^. But no power of a multitude preuayleth
against the might of Jesus. He as easelye puttethe a Legion to flight, as one
man. Then that captain devil who spoke for all the rest, greatly besought
Jesus, whom he acknowledged to be his conqueror, that he would not clean
exile him out of that countrey^. O perverse malice of the devil. He desires
not forgeuenes, nor any other benefit, whereby he may be in better ease. He
counteth^t a pleasure and benefit, if he may be suffered there to continewe,
whereas most occasion is for him to do harm: Even as though a sort of snap
haunses set all on mischief, enforced by a greater power of the prince, and
commanded to break garrison, or forsake their hold and fortress, would make
this peticion: We desire no wages, but only that your grace will suffer us to
raunge abroad in the country, and rob and reaue at our own peril.

When that unto this request and peticion of the devil, Jesus made no
answer, there was not far of a great heard of swine, nighe unto the
mountain feeding in the fields. Thou knoweste here good reader, the beast
that was abhorred of all the right Jews, and wherewith the Gentiles, a people
given to Idolatrye, were chefly delyted. Therefore the devils desired that they
might be suffered at the least wise to enter into the swyne: And if we may
not (say they) destroy the man whom thou delyuerest from us, yet give us leave
sumwhat to wreake our malice by destroyinge of the unclean beasts. That
Jesus granted them without any stycking, who cared not for the safeguard and
preseruacion of swyne, but of men: teaching us hereby that for to save even but
one man, we ought not to pass upon the loss of other worldly things, be it
never so great. The Legion of the unclean spirits, forsook the man, who
remained to be purified with the spirit of Christ, and went into the heard of
swyne, which were forthwith carried headlong with great violence, down the
stepe hill into the lake or sea, and there drowned. The swyne were almost twoe
thousand in number. Let men beware that they be not found like unto
swyne. For into such souls the devils are right glad to enter. Now the
swyneheardes after they had seen this wonderful fact, did not help their
swyne, but fled away for fear into the next city, and into the country
there about, and showed every body what they had seen. That good shepehearde
helpethe his flock being in ieopardye. But when the pastoures or shepeheardes
are themselves as bad as their naughty flock that is paste all grace and
goodness, then both the flock goes to wrecke and utterly perishethe and the
shepeheardes do nothing else but fly away for fear. As Soon as this thing was
noysed abroad, the people came runnyng thick and threfolde out of the town
and country, desirous to see with their iyes, what they had heard before with
their ears. For all seemed unto them incredible that the swyneheardes had told
them. Wherefore they came themselves unto Jesus, and saw the manne whom they
all knew, before vexed with a spirit of exceeding cruelnes, and wont by reason
of his great fury and madness, to braste al his chains and fetters in pieces,
to rent and tear a soundre his clothes, to beat himself with stones,
violentlye to assault those that passed by, and to make all the places there
about to ryng with his furious crying, and roaring: saw him, I say, then sit
quietly at Jesus feet both clothed, and in his right mind. Now they which
were present, and saw what was dove, recounted to such as came thither, the
whole history of all that befell, even from the beginning, both how the Legion
of devils was cast out of the man, and also how the hogs were drowned in the
water. Wherefore when they (the mattier now diligently examined and tried out)
were throughlye persuaded that all was of truth which had been told them of
the swyne heardes, then were they afraied, and began to desire Jesus to
depart out of their quarters. This wicked, and gross nation, knew not Jesus
thoroughly. They perceived his power, but they marked not his goodness,
manifestlye declared in that he restored this man to his right mind: and they
were a great deal more moved in their minds for the loss of their swyne,
then glad of the man's health and recovery. They feared their Oxen, their
Asses, and their hogs, and took great care for the belly, and none at al for
the soul. And yet for all that, it is a certain beginning of salvation, sum
what to stand in dread of Gods power.

The Lord, teaching us by deed, that the roses of Gods word and the gospel
ought not in any wise to be cast unto hogs, reculed unto the water side
and took ship. In the mean while the fellow which was delivered from the
devil, perceiving the author of his health to depart, began to desire him
that he might be one of his train. The Lords pleasure was that he should
rather be a publisher of his mercy, and goodness, then one that should
accompany him in his iourneys, because it was expediente for the soul health
of many that he should so be. Get the hence rather (quod he) unto thy house and
to thy kynsfolkes and acquayntaunce, and show them how much god has done
for the, and how he took compassion upon the when all manne pitied the, but
yet demed the paste all remedy. That countreye contained in it ten cities, and
therefore was called in the Greek language, Decapolis. The man obeying the
commandment of Jesus, departed, and told in all those cities both what case
he was once in, and in what case he was now made again through the benefit
of Jesus. Every man believed that his words were true, by reason very many of
the same country knew him before, and also because he showed by his outward
behavior, that he was by the power of Jesus, perfitely restored unto his right
mind. He was not ashamed to speak of his old calamities, whiles he went
about to set forth Gods glory.

Hear these things thou wurshypper of Idols, thou whoremonger, thou dyser,
thou ryotous follow, thou waster, thou ertorcioner, thou robber, thou house
burner, thou warryer, thou poysoner, thou murderer: despair not: only run
unto Jesus. Consider not the multitude and greuousnes of thine offenses: only
regard that Jesus is he that came to save all men, and is able to do all
things with a beck. When the legion of deuiles has forsaken the, when thou
art restored to thy right mind again, then blase, especially among thy
friends, and acquaintance, the great mercy of God toward the. Be not ashamed
to confess thy former life. For this also shall make greatly for the
aduau^cyng and setting forth of the mercy of Jesus, if it be known to as many
as may be possible, how abhominably thou ly^eddest before. Knowledge and
confess what thou haste been: And where as thou art now suddenly changed
and become another manne, ascribe it not unto thine own deseruinges, but unto
the free mercy of God: who takethe mercy and compassion upon whomsoever it
pleases him, for as much as he is debtour and bound to no man.

When this seed (as a man may call it) was sown among the Gerasites, ye Lord
Jesus passed eftsoon ye water. That he so oftetimes chau^geth place makes for
the aduauncyng of the gospel: and the variety of miracles monisheth us how
the teacher of the gospel ought busyly to do his devour whensoever occasion
serves, to bring who^soeuer he can to salvation. Now when he was brought over
to ye other side, thither resorted afreshe, a great multitude of people. For
like as the lodestone draws unto it iron, so does benefyeence and well doing
allure all men unto her. Whiles the Lord was by the water side, there came
unto him one of ye rulers of ye Sinagoge, called Iairus. This Iairus moved by
the fame of Jesus, My daughter lies at point of death.
came thither with the rest of the multitude. For there was a thing which grieved
his heart very sore, wherein he much desired ye presence of Jesus. Therefore
when he saw yt Jesus was brought again unto ye shore, and set al and, he was
right joyous, and (as they are ever lowly and crouchinge which greatly desire
any thing) although he were a ruler of the Synagoge, that is, a primate among
stately fellows, yet fell he down at the fete of Jesus, and besought him
saying: Lord, my daughter a maiden of twelve year old, in whom I reposed the
chiefeste solace of mine old age, is in as great peril of life as may be,
and lies now at the mercy of God: cumme, and lay thy hand upon her, that
thorough thy touching she may be safe, and live. Jesus perceiving well by his
words how weak his faith was as yet, And he we^^ with him.
in as much as he made mention of the extreme ieoperdye that she was in, as
though he had not been able to reliue her, if she had been dead in deed: and
in that he required his presence, and also the touching of his hand, as
though he could not being absente, yea, and with a beck make whole
whomsoever him list: Jesus, I say, promised him to come, and so followed him
going homewarde a good pace: geuynge thereby an ensample how ready the
pastor of Christ's flock ought to be in procuring soul health to al men,
both to Greeks, and to barbarous nations, to them which are descended of
noble parentage, and of base lineage, to rich, and to poor, to learned and to
unlearned. And as he went, there was occasion given him whereby to reform the
imperfect faith of the said ruler of the synagoge, and that by the ensample
of a woman, which the less that she knew* Christ by the law, the more was
she to be borne with all, and excused of her unbelief. There followed Jesus as
he went to the ruler of the synagoges house, merueilous great multitude of
people, partlye because it was not possible to disseuer them from him, and
partly to behold the miracle which should be wrought. The nobility of the
suyter made them more desirous to behold. Wherefore as each of them preased to
be next Jesus, so was he payned with the throngyng of the people.

In this prease was there a woman that had a fylthy, a shameful, and also an
incurable disease, and had been sick thereof, the space of.xii. year (for it
was the bluddye flyxe) which was in so much the worse taking, because whiles
she put great hope of recovery in Physycians, that mader her many fair
promises, and whiles disapoynted of one, she went unto another for boot that
put her in more assurance of health, and from him again to another, being
continually fed with good hope, and comfortable words, she spente all that
ever she had upon them: and yet for all this so little was she helped by
Physike, that she was in much worse case then she should have been if it had
not chanced her to meddle with the Phisicians at all, who whiles they made
many large promises, and payned the poor wretch with their serviceable
diligence, both increased her old grief, and also added thereunto a new,
that is to say, unto her bloody flyxe, poverty. Such undoubtedly are the
commune sort of those that profess human medicine. But it is often times
seen that health is gotten by utter despairing of health. After she began
once to distruste the Physicians, and they perceiuinge that she had nothing
left to give them, had now at the length given sentence that there was no hope
of her recovery, than began she to be nerer unto health, then she was before.
For God helpethe none more wyllyngly then such a one as is clean destitute
and forsaken of all worldly succors. This woman heard but tell of Jesus, and
furthwith she conceived a wonderful great confydence of him, and preased in
among the thyckest of the multitude. The bashefulnes of womanhode, and the
fylthynes of her disease, would not suffer her to do as the ruler of the
synagoge did, but she came behind Jesus, and at the length when she had with
much a do wound her self out of the prease of people, which thruste, and
thronged one another, then touched she his garmente. For she had such
confydence in him, that she said secretelye to herself in this wise.

If I may touch but the only hemme of his garmente, I shall be delivered of
my disease. When all the Phisicians which took much money to put her to
pain had given her over, she happened to mete with an other Physician, who
sodaynelye restored her to perfect health, and that for naught. She was not
deceived in her trust. For as soon as she touched the Lords garmente, the
issue of blood staunched, the humor being sodaynlye corrected, which was
wont to issue, and well out, as it had been out of a quick spring.
Moreover she felt now again the self same strength and lustines in all her
body, that she was wont to have before, or ever she began to be sick of this
disease.

Let such as be effeminate persons, and made woman like through excess,
and worldely delicacies or pleasures, have recourse no whitherels for succoure,
save unto Jesus. If they trust to Philosophiers, lawyers, art Magike, or
Pharisaicall ceremonies, then shall they, after both time and wit consumed
here in, do nothing else but increase their disease, and win poverty:
except peradventure such poverty be less grievous unto them by reason that
age is now spente, and wit clean decayed and gone.

The woman highly rejoiced when she had, as it were, stolen this benefit of
Christ, whom she thought might (as a man) be deceived, and kept from the
knowledge of the thing that was done: or else if he could not so be, then
trusted she verelye that he would of his goodness, pardon the shamefastnes of
womanhood.

The Lord having more regard to Gods glory, and the health of a great
many, than to the shamefastnes of one woman, knowing right well that he was
touched, and that the woman had received the benefit of health thereby, turned
him to the multitude preasynge behind him, and said: who touched my clothes?
The disciples thinking nothing upon this that befell, answerede the lord
again, and said: Thou scest a great prease of people thrusting and throngyng
the on every side, and yet ask thou who touches the? They that read the
gospel do touch Christ. Such as do consecrate or receive his holy body do
the same: but al are not healed which do touch him. The wom^n alone that
touched him with a strong faith was healed. Jesus required no other reward
for his benefit, but only a confession of the disease, and a knoweledge of
Gods mercy. Therefore when the woman constrained by shamefastenes, held her
peace, trusting that she might still have been vndiscryed, he looked round
about on the people, as though he had been desirous to know her that had
touched him. This lokyng about of Jesus, was a gesture of him that courteously
required a confession of the benefit received. He would not utter her by
name, left he should have seemed to have hit her in the teethe, with the good
turn he did her. The woman, of a woman lie shamefastenesse, and not of any
vnthankfullnesse, held her peace. Then was there a prycke or prouocacion
given, to make her to put away that unprofitable shamefastenes, and to wrynge
out of her an wholesome confession. For what is not the look of Jesus able to
do? In this wise he beheld Peter, and forth with he came unto himself
again. The woman knowing in what case she came unto Jesus, and what great
benefit she had received of him, durst nor dissemble the matter, but all
womanlye bashefulnes laid aparte, came fearing, and tremblinge before him.
For she stood in great dread, lest he would have rebuked her for her
leudnes.

Then fell she down at his knees, and in the audience of them all, showed the
whole matter as it was in every point without any dissimulacion or coloring:
how long the disease had hanged upon her, how physic had been practysed
in vain, how she touched his garmente privily, and what a great trust she
had conceived of him. The lord Jesus loves such a confession as causethe the
sinner to know himself, and to give all the glory unto God for the
restitucion of his health, and finally that makes him to provoke many mo to
have like faith: puttyng us in remembrance, that of him only cummeth free
health and salvation, and that it make the no matter how many, and how
abominable man's enormities be, but how much confidence one has, either in
the power, or else in the goodness of almighty God. If the disease of thy mind
be secret and unknown, yet confess it unto Jesus, who neither utters it
again, nor imbraydeth yt therewith, but makes the whole. If thou have openly
offended, then make thou open confession, that like as thou haste entised many
by thy naughtye ensample, to vice and sinful living, so contrary wise being
turned from sin, thou may provoke many to amend their lives. That
shamefastnes is utterly to be put away, which both enuyeth God his glory,
and our neighbor his soul health. Assuredly thou shall be well apayed that
thou art rid thereof, when thou once felest thy self more quiet in conscience
through thy confession, then thou waste before, as though thou had heard
the self same words of the Lord Jesus that the woman heard. What heard she?
Daughter, the faith thou had in me, has restored the unto health, which
physike was not able to give the. Depart with a joyful, and a quiet mind. I
will that thou enjoy this my benefit continually. O thou ruler of the
synagoge, see thou not? Hear thou not these words? For all this was done
to enstructe the, and such as thou art. The woman was sick of an incurable
disease, she waxed dayelye worse and worse, and yet for the notable faith she
had in Jesus, she was healed by the only touching of his garmente. And thou
casleste, as one would say, the Physician home to thy house: thou
commaundeste him to lay his hand upon the paciente, and requirest haste.

saw the wundring, and them that wept, and wayled greatly, and went in, and
said unto them: why make ye this a do, and weep? The damsel is not dead but
slepeth: and they laughed him to scorn. But he put them all out, and takes
the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were with him, and
enters in where the damsel say, and takes the damsel by the hand, and
says unto her. Tabith a cumi, which is (if one do enterprete it) damsel, I
say unto the, arise. And straight way the damsel arose, and walked. For she
was of the age of twelve years. And they were a stoned out of measure, and he
charged them straightly that no man should know of it, and commanded to give
her meat. Whiles Jesus was aunswerynge the woman, there came messengers from
the ruler of the Synagoges house, which said unto him: Thy daughter is dead.
Why do thou put the master to further pains in vain? These words spoken,
the ruler of the Synagoge, who had before a doubtful hope mengled with much
fear, being now as a man in despair, durst make no farther suite unto the
Lord. The messangers put him in despair, saying: She is dead. So many are
wont to speak by those persons which have fallen to the committing of some
heinous enormitie: as for an ensample, of aduoutrie, inceste, theft, or
manslaughter, saying: He is at a point: he is paste all goodness. Surely
Jesus sufferethe none to fall into desperacion, but such a one as refuses to
believe in him. It is the property of Jews to despair. The good Christian who
knows the goodness of the Lord to be ^g^ll with his power, never
despaireth. Christ therefore help and lyfted up the fayntyng hope of the
ruler of the Synagoge, with sweet and confortable words, saying: be not
afraid although it be so that thy daughter be dead in deed. Only have
belefe. It skylleth not in how evil case she be, but how strong and
steadfast is thy faith. When he had thus spoken, he came unto the ruler of the
Synagoges house, and entered in, but leauyng all the rablemente of people
without doors, sufferyng not so much as his disciples, to go in with him,
save alonely Simon Peter, James, and John, who was James his brother. These
following him, he entered into the ruler of the Synagoges house, there found he
al things right gorgiouslly, and with great pomp prepared for the buryall of
the maiden, and beside this many of her kynsmen, and kynswomen lamentably
bewaylyng her ouertymely death. For she common sort are wounte to take the
death of young folks much greuouslyer then of old, where as in deed nothing is
more to be desired of god, then in that age to dye, when it is most pleasure
to live, or ever the soul be blemished with the manifold euyls of this
present life. For it little forces how long a man live, but how well, and
virtuously.

Jesus therefore teaching us that we ought not to bewail the dead with vain
funeral songs, caused the mourners to cease their noise. Why, ^aythe he, make
you such a clamoure and noise in the house with your weeping, and waylynge? The
maid is not dead, but a sleep. Truly unto him she did but sleep, who could
much easlyer wake^, and relyue her with a word of his mouth then one of us
can wake another out of his sleep. And sleep is in every point a resemblaunce
and meditacion of death. For it brings to rest the powers of the soul, and
takes away sense, so that if it were continual, it were very death in
deed. But such as stood by when she died, not perceiving what Jesus meante by
these words, laughed him to skorne because he believed she was yet alive, sith
it evidently appeared that she was dead. Jesus drove all these folks out a
doors, which filled the house full of noise and dynne with their vain
weeping, and waylyng, and did not only nothing at all profit the dead body
therewith, but also encreaced the woefullnesse of her parents, and laughed him,
the aucthour of health, to skorne. There nedethe not the presence of such
people, where the soul being dead through sin, is to be called again to
the life of innocence, and virtuous living.

This thing did Jesus then in a another man's several house. What would he
now do, if he saw the great pomp that some use in funerals even to very
madness? There are certain persons hiered to feign mourninge and weping, to
cry out, to tear the hear that many times is none of theyrs, to knock
themselves on the breast, to scratche their faces, to cast out words that no
frantycke manne would speak the like, full of distruste and unbelief. They
set milk by the dead karkes, therewyth to allure the soul, strayinge and
wandryng abroad, into the body again. They oftetymes cry and call upon the
dead body by name: Phylip cum again: Come again to us good Phylip. They chyde
and braule with him saying: Why have thou forsaken thy friends? Why wouldes
thou kill us with mourning? Thou lackeddest nothing to live all at pleasure,
neither riches, nobility, honorable aduaunceme^tes, beauty, nor age. O thou
cruel fellow: O wretches that we be. etc.

Now put me hereunto trumpettes that sound unto the deaf, the syngyng men
that sing vain funeral songs unto the dead body, which hearethe them not:
and do not thereby take away the sorrow of the lyuinge, but increase it.
Furthermore, put hereto the long rows of torch-bearers, and the raye of those
that are clad all in black, and mournyng apparel: Yea, there be sum also
which cause horses trapped in black to be brought into this pompous show,
to carry the dead man's flagge and cootearmoure, and with their down lokyng,
(for their necks are fast bound unto their legs) to make as though they
sought for their master that is descended and gone down to hell. What shall I
rehearse the great feasts, and solemn ba^kettes that they are wont to make?
The magnificke, and costlye buildings of tombs, as though there were little
pompes, and super^^uite used in life, except dead folks did also declare
themselves to be attached with these vices. Now sythe^s even those that are of
the wysest sort of the heathen, suppose these to be mad and fond customs:
how much more then ought they not to be had in use among christen men,
which do all sleep rather then dye, and shall awake again the last day at
the sownyng of the Angels trumpet. Therefore, to return to the order, and
process of thy storye, when Jesus had put all these folks out a doors, he
took the parents of the maiden, and went into the secret chamber whereas the
coarse lay.

For his pleasure was that they should be witnesses of the miracle which he
intended to work. Here the Lord took the maiden by the hand, and as though he
would have wakened her out of her sleep, said unto her: Tabitha cumy, the
which in the Syrian language is as much to say, as how maiden, arise. Such
as are in a deep or sound sleep cannot many times be wakened, although a man call them often times with a loud voice, and pinche them never so much:
and when they be called up, yet do they not by an by awake, but being a good
while half a sleep or drousy, gape, stretch their arms, nod with their
heads, that many times the chynne stryketh the breast: and if a man call not
still upon them, they fall aslepe again. This dead maiden arose furthwith,
and walked at the voice of Jesus, being not only relyued, but also very merry,
and iocunde. For the soul which through thenforcement of disease had forsaken
the body, And they were asto^ed out of measure. etc.
knew the voice of his maker, and without delay returned again into the
house that it went out of.

The more sorrowful that her death was by reason of her young age, (for she was
but twelve year old) the greater was the myrthe and joy which was made for
her relyuyng. Her father and mother were greatly amassed with this strange, and
wonderful sight. Jesus who neither required reward or mede of them nor yet
thanks for his labor, only commanded them to give her meat, because it
might thereby more certainly appear how she was restored to life. For catyng
is not only a sure token of life, but also of welfare, and good health. He
likewise charged them that they should not blase this thing abroad which was
privily done, and in the presence of a few persons, either because he would
have it rather published by such as he put out a doors, then by the ruler
of the Sinagoge (who should have been more enuyed, but less believed if he had
been the publisher hereof) either because, in that he commanded them to keep
the thing secret, which he knew right well they would not do, his will was to
teach us how that in all the good deeds we do, we ought utterly to exchewe
all vain glory, and worldly praise. If a man wade deper herein, and search
what secret learning lies hid in this miracle, (for even the very doings of
Jesus be parables) it shall appear that this dead maiden of twelve year old,
and scarcely yet mariable, sygnifieth a man, which by frayeltye of nature
has first fallen to the committing of some privy crime or sin, and
therefore, because he is not yet past regard of honestye, nor by long custom
rooted in sin, may with the medicine of shame, easlye be helped, and cured
thereof. When any such offends, it becomes the Curates and pastors to
follow the gentle demeanor of Jesus, who without making any great a do, raised
the maiden at home in the presence of a few witnesses. It shall be sufficient
to rebuke such as have thus offended and done amiss, secretly: lest their
fault being once disclosed, they either set all shame aparte, or else pyne
away through ouermuche sorrow and heaviness.

The first offense if it happen through frayltie and weakness, is very sone
amended. It is much harder to cure him whose wickedness is once cum to the
knowledge of the people: and hardest of all to heal such a one as is hardened
and rooted in sin by long custom of synnyng. And therefore he rayseth the
maiden by virtue of his bare word in her fathers several house, sufferyng
few to be present thereat. But he makes more a do when the young springalte,
which was borne out upon men's shoulders to be buried, is restored to life
again. His mother and all the people that go with her, make great mean and
lamentacion. The young man is had out to burying, and first his mother hears
Christ say: weep not. Then Christ touches the coffin, and causes the porters
to stay. Anon he calls the dead man, with a loud voice, saying: How, I say
to the, arise. Then first he rayseth himself, and sits in the coffin:
afterward he begins to speak, at the length he whippeth out of the coffyn,
and is delivered unto his mother.

But Christ commands Lazarus grave to be showed him, as though he knew not
where it were: he wepeth once, or twyse. He is troubled, and groneth in
spirit. He commands the grave stone to be removed and calls out Lazarus
with a loud voice. The dead man cummeth out, but bound: At the length he is
unbound, and falls to his meat.

It was no more maisterie for Christ to raise up the karkas which had layne
four days dead, then the body newly dead, who at the day of dome, will by
the voice of thaungell, raise and call to life again, all men's bodies that
have been buried in so many thousand years before: but by this figure his will
was to show us how much a do it is for them to turn from sinful living,
who of long time have been accustomed to vices, not to the end that we should
despair of such persons, but because we should endeavor to amend our lives
in season, and more earnestly go about to bring all that are in such case to
amendment. Moreover I think it also here worthy to be noted, that where as
Jesus would have his benefyte publyshed of the Gerasyte possessed of the
devil, yet commanded he the ruler of the Synagoge to keep silence. For the
enuyous Synagoge went about by all means, to ouerwhelme and oppress the
glory of the Lord Jesus, the which Synagoge did also afterward beat the
Apostles, and charged the^ that they should not be so hardy as once to speak
of his name. But their envy prevailed nothing at all. The more they went
about to oppress his wholesome name, the more was it preached among the
Gentyles. The priests holden their peace: The Phariseis cry out, and speak
against him: The Scribes rail upon him: Herod laugheth him to skorne: but
wurshyppers of Idolles, thieves, extorcioners, and such as are attached with the
vices of inceste and aduoutry, suddenly delivered by the grace of the gospel
from their old sins as from most fell and cruel dyuels, do magnifye and
praise him.

The.vj. Chapter.

WHat occasyon soever Christ have to go any whyther, he is always after one
fashyon, and like himself: that is, he ever brings health, to teach his
disciples that accompany him, how we christians ought never to cease to do the
business of the gospel, but still to go about whenever occasion serves
thereunto, to make of evil men good, and of good better, whether it happen us
to continue and lead our lives at home in our own houses, or else in foreyne
and strange countries: in publyke place, or in pryuate. Moreover he that is
unfeignedly indewed with such virtue and goodness as belongs to christian
profession* whether it chance him to be in ship, or in wagan, or to have
familiar talk and communicacion, or else to be present at feast or at banquet,
yea, to make short tale, even when he bourdeth to, or makes any game or
pastyme, he so demeaneth himself, that ever some depart away from him, much
amended in their manners and conversation, by reason of his company.

Therefore Jesus, who attempted to go unto the Gerasytes, forsook the places
nighe unto the waterside, and returned back into his own country, lest he
should have seemed readyer to do strangers and foreyners good, then his own
country men. For Nazareth deserved to have this honorable name to be called
his country, because he was fostred and continued there a long season. And
when the sabbath day was come.
There went with him his disciples, the which then followed him every where
continually. Now when the sabbath was cum, upon the which day the Jews were
wont according to an ancient, and right laubable custom they had, to
assemble together, not because they would pass the holy time, that is to
say, lose it, with the beholding of folyshe syghtes, tellyng of vain and
unfruitful tales, vsyng of unholy pastyme, or syngyng of ydell balades and
songs: but by holy communicacion either to learn gods law themselves, or
else to teach the same to other: Jesus entered into the Sinagoge in like manner as
other did, to give an ensample to his, whereby all men should perceive what a
great shame and dishonestie it should be for us christian men, since the
Jews so earnestly labored thoroughly to learn and know a carnal law, which
neither was perfect ne should continewe for ever, and was written but of
Moses a mortal man, if we would not with semblable or rather more diligence,
study to know the Phylosophye and doctrine of the gospel, which the very
son of god his own self taught and set forth unto the world. Wherefore,
when Jesus was teaching in the temple, his authority was the less esteemed of
many, because he was right well known unto them, as pertaining unto the
flesh. They knew his poor parents, and the simple and homely house that he
came out of. But they never supposed any thing at all of his heavenly father,
and everlasting house, from whence he came down for our cause. They knew his
fathers occupacion, wherewith Joseph mayntayned and found his house, the which
science himself also practysed in his first years. He was a ^arpentoure, a
convenient occupacion for him, by whom the heavenly father once made this whole
world. By a carpentour mankind was created and made, And many that heard him
were astonished. etc,
and by a carpentour mete it was that man should be repaired. Therefore when
those that knew Jesus (who until he was almost thyrtye years old, lived
among his friends, and never appeared to have any knowleage in the Phariseis
learning) heard him teach with great authority, such things as they never
had heard before, of the excellently well learned Phariseis, they wondered
greatly, saying one to another: how is this fellow so suddenly changed, and
becum another man? from whence has he all these things? and what new kind
of wisdom is this that is given him? from whence has he this mighty and
effectual power to work miracles, so great as we never heard the like to have
been in any of the prophets? Sithe he has been from us but a short while, how
cummeth it to pass that he is cum again suddenly altered, and clean changed?
Is not this the self same Jesus the carpe^tour, the son of Joseph the
wright, and Mary a poor simple woman? Did not we know him, and all his kynred,
and progenye? Do not the next of his kyn, that is to say, his brethren and
sisters, dwell here among us? And so they had half disdayn at Jesus, that he,
who not long before was taken for an vnderlyng and a person of no reputacion,
was now suddenly exalted to high estimacio^, and authority. For they were
offended with thimbecillitie, and weakness of his flesh, whereof they had over much
knowleage:

Jesus said unto them. a prophet is not despised. etc.
When the lord Jesus perceived this, he said unto them: I prophet is no where
more despised then in his own, country among his aliance, kinnesmen, and
familiares. Ghostly business ill agrees with fleshlye affeccions, neither is
it in any wise besemyng that a true prophet or preacher of ye gospel, who
teaches us to set naught by this world, who promyseth the joys of heaven,
who teaches that we must be newly borne through baptysme in Christ Jesus, who
teaches also that w^ ought to mortify our members which we have upon earth,
to thentent we may live ghostlye in heaven: it is not besemyng, I say, that
such a one here know either country, house, acquaintance, kynred or friends.
Neither is it any maruayle if earthly citizens know not him again, And he
could there show no miracle. etc.
since he is now made denisen of an other country.

Wherefore Jesus, though he were almyghtye, and desirous to save as many as
might be, yet could he not there among his countreimen work many miracles, for
that he was let so to do by the unbelief of his acquayntaunce and
kynsfolkes. For whereas being among alyauntes, he had easily cured very many of
all kinds of diseases, cast out dyuels, and healed leapers, here in his own
country, he only heals a few sick folks, and that with the laying of his
hands upon them.

For this cause he as one merueylyng at so great unbelief of his countrymen,
departed from thence, and trauayled throughout all the tounes and borowes there
about, sowyng every where as he went, the sede of the gospel. Hereby were
the disciples covertly monyshed* that in things concerning the preaching and
setting forth of the gospel, they should in no wise trust unto worldly
affeccions (for the self same thing which then chanced unto Jesus in his
country, should afterward betyde them in Iewrye) but go wheresoever they
saw any hope, and lykelyhode of plentyfull increase. There the preaching of
the gospel brings forth fruit most abundantly wheresoever the hearers are
inclined to believe. Such inclinacion to believe, is there neither among kynred,
Phariseis, nor kings. Kynred despises, the Phariseis have disdain and envy,
and kings laughe to skorne the folyshnesse of the cross. Now was it high
time that the Apostles which were by Christ appointed to the ministracion of
the gospel, and had already a good while followed him continually, should as
it were, make a flourishe before their office and ministry, and give their
captain a say of their diligence, and loyaltye. Wherefore he called unto him
those twelve, whom as most worthy persons, he specially chose and pycked out
to take this charge upon them: and being assembled before him, he enstructed
them all with one sermon or lesson, to thentent that they sent of one master,
and having like commandments given them, should not in any wise disagree in
their preaching one from another. And because they should the more profit and
edify, he sent them out by two and two, puttyng us in remembrance by this
couplyng of them together, of brotherly charity, without which there cummeth
no profit of the gospel. He lymited unto every couple, as it had been to
certain deputies, or lieutenauntes, their province. For this was very
expedient to be done, for the enlargyng of the kingdom of the gospel. A^^
gave the^ power against. ^c.
He sent them out weaponlesse, lest that man's aids should challenge any thing
in this heavenly business. Further lest their authority should have been
little esteemed, for as much as they were but fishers, underlings, simple
folks, and unlettered, he gave the^ that power, wiche worldly prynces^ are
not able to give to their ambassadors, and deputies. For he gave them power to
deliver men of diseases, and to cast out devils. What like thing can ye
Emperor give? He can give abou^daunce of gold, and silver, hoostes of men,
battle axes, and all manoure of artyllarye, and engynes belongyng to war,
whereof he has great store and ple^tie. But there is no head officer, or
deputy of his, who has so great virtue, that he can by calling upon
themperous name, heal so much as men's iyes when they be bleared. And he gave
this power unto his disciples under condition that they should therewith,
freely and without reward taking, help all those that neded the same.

Now to thentent they should be the better prepared to take in hand, and
execute that office, which requires such a ministre as is quick and spedy,
and not a luskyshe loyterer or sluggerde, he charged them to carry no manor of
baggage, vitaile, or weapon with them in this iourneye, save a rod only, not
a scrippe to put their vitayles in, not somuche as bread which may be
carried about without a scrip, nor gyrdels laden with money, neither wear any
boots upon their legs, but only be ^hod with sa^dals, to keep the soles of
their feet, that neither the stones should hurt, nor thorns prick them:
and finally to content themselves every manne with one garment. The ente^te of
Jesus who gave these enstruccions was nothing else, but after a gross manor, to
inculke and beat into the heads of his disciples (who were as yet raw and
ignorant) how such a one as takes on him the ministracion of the gospel,
ought to be disburdened, and free from all care of corporal things, lest any
sudden chance befall, that may hyndre the increase and procedyng of the
heavenly doctrine. As this business was far diverse from worldly affairs:
even so was this kind of ambassade or legacion new, and such a one as had not
been used before. They received a form of doctrine, lest they should
presume to teach any thing which their master had not taught them before.
And this thing held they commune with the legacions of man, where it is
death to pass the limits of the commandments, or commission. They are sent
all of one lord with like power, lest any disdain or priuye malice should
arise among them.

They are sent by two and two together because they should remember brotherly
charity and one brother aid another. They are sent to sundry places and
countries, to the end that mo should take profit of the gospel.

They have power given them to heal diseases, but in the name of Jesus: because
that like as they received another man's lerning to dispense and teach
faithfully, and not their own, so should they know that it was gods power,
and not theyrs, wherewith they cured diseases.

He forbad them to carry about either scrippe, bread, money, or two coats,
because they should with full affiaunce hang upon the promise of their master,
and have sure confidence to be safe from all the force and violence of their
enemies through his help: and perfitlye know that by his providence they
should want nothing pertaining to the temporal necessity of the body. For
where as nothing is able to suffice sensual^ie and pleasure, so the least
thing that may be, suffices the necessity of nature. Neither did the Lord
speak these words meaning thereby as though it should never belefull for
those that be ministers and preachers of the gospel to carry about with the^
any necessary little fardell, or money, since the Apostles, and bishops are not
in our time afraid so to do: (Yea paraduenture it is more praise worthy if a
man would on his own propre cost and charge, teach the gospel) but by
such manoure of figurative speakynges called of the Greeks hyperbole, his
entente was to pluck out of his disciples minds (who were as yet gross and
rude) all carfulness for those things that are wont to be an hinderau^ce or
let unto the mind, when it goes about any heavenly enterprise: else wist he
well that they would not forget to speak as follows: Thou sendest us out to
countries that we know not, and make us, who are naked and weaponlesse, to
be many ways in ieopardye of our lives. But who shall feed us if hunger cum
upon us? who shall defend us if any violence be used against us? who shall
clothe us if it chance to be cold weather? Thou wylt have us to teach freely.
Thou wylt we cure men for naught. But he that lives in a strange country
neadeth many things.

This pensive and filthy carfulness, because for the most part, it
springs of distruste, he earnestly went about to wede out of their minds, as
a thing not besemyng the greatness and weyghte of such a business as they
were deputed unto. Furthermore the figurative manor of speaking that he uses,
serves hereunto, that such things as he teaches them, may the depelier be
fastened in their rude and ignorant minds. For the teacher of the gospel
should nothing offend if he ware shoes, or had two coats, being amongst the
barbarous people called ^etae, or else if he did take vitayle, and a good sum
of money with him, being in gate to the sands of Afrike, or to sum nation
where as there is no ientle entertaynement, and receiving of strangers. But
what thing so ever hyndreth the procedyng of the gospel, the same is utterly
to be renounced. Now considre me, with how great a burden they go charged to
the ministracion of the gospel, who carry about with them princely riches,
dignities, promocions, worldly pleasures, and a gredie desire to be avenged if
any thing happen to their grief, and displeasure.

This fardell that Christ speaks of here is rather in the mind, then in
carrying about of scrippes, and superfluous clothing. Who so will not cast away
all these fardelles (I mean of mind) the same is not meet to be the
messenger and ambassador of Jesus Christ. Likewise there is a figurative
speaking in the things which he licenceth them to use. For he gives them
leave to use each one a wande, and a pair of sandals. The lightest manoure of
shoe that is, is the sandall: and it so saves the feet from taking any
harm, that it lets not a man to make quick speed in his journey. Therefore
it is but one thing that he monisheth, which permits them to use sandals,
and forfendeth to wear shoes. For he forbyddeth nothing else, but slacknesse
in doing of their duty, and exorteth them to use spedinesse therein.

Again it is but one thing that he warns them of, which gives them leave
to carry a wande, and takes away from them the use of staves. For a wande
socoureth and stays the walkyng manne, and nothing hyndreth him in his
iourneye, but rather causes him to make quicker speed. Now the staff as it
burtheneth a man to bear it: so is it wont to be carried against violence.
Therefore he that permits them to use no other weapon but a wa^de only, and
forbyddeth them to carye a staff, wills undoubtedly that the preacher of
the gospel be by no other aid safely fensed against the assaults of yuell
men, then by the only help of Christ. A wande is mete for a wayfairing
man, and a staff for a fighter. Moreover he that has the ha^delyng of the
gospel, must always go forward to things of higher perfeccion, and be
fardest from desire of reuengement.

After that Christ had plucked this carfulness out of the minds of his
Apostles, then went he about to show them a way, how it should cum to pass
that they should never need to be careful for such things. Take ye no
thought, says he, neither for harborough, ne sustenaunce: but after ye once be
entered into village, or city, wheresoever it be your chance to be received,
be the house never so poor and homely, there abide you till such time as you
think it meet for you to depart sum whither else, moved through desire to
set forth and aduau^ce the gospel. And being but few in number, and
contented with a little, And whosoever ever shall not receive you, nor hear you. etc.
you shall not be chargeable geastes to any man. It is in manoure impossible
that the^^ be any where any good town or city so far past all grace and
goodness, wherein there can not one manne be found who will be glad to receive
such geastes as ye are, since there are many which will not stick to wage a
phisicia^ with a large salarie, and send for him a great way of. If you
chance to cum to any so unkind a city, or house, that the inhabitauntes
thereof will not receive you, notwithstanding you bring them of your own
accord an heavenly gift or present, wherewith both bodies and souls are
healed, yet cease you not for a few hard hearted persons, to do the business
you have taken in hand: but yet depart you out of that city for a season, to
other cities: and or ere you go away, embrayde such persons as would not
receive you, with their great folly, and madness. Get you out into the
streets, and shake of the dust styckyng on your feet, that they may call to
remembrance how there came sum unto them, who freely offered them health
and sauetie, and brought them the ioyfullest message that could be: and may
further perceive that like as so excellent a good thing cannot by any manoure
of reward be worthilye recompensed: even so such precions ware and
merchandise ought not to be thruste to any which lotheth the same, and is not
wyllyng to receive it: and this do you to the intent they may blame themselves
for their own damnacion, because they would rather perish, when they might
have been saved: and also know perfectlye how you sought for nothing else
among them, but only the health and salvation of your neighbors, insomuche
that you would not endamage them as much as with the loss of a little
quantity of dust. It becu^meth well enough my ambassadors to use such manor
of proud demeanure against froward, and disdainful persons. At your
departure speak unto them this one thing following, although they be not
wyllyng to hear it: know you that whether you receive us, or receive us not,
the kingdom of God is cumme. If you receive us, it is cum to your great
wealth and commodity. But if you receive us not, yet shall the same cumme to
your great evil, and confusion. When Christ's messengers were furnished with
these necessaries for their iourneye, they took their leave of their master,
and as it was given them in commandment, they moved and exhorted all men to
be repentaunte for their former life, showing them how the kingdom of God was
already present, which through faith of the gospel would bring unto all men
perfect righteousness. For the chief and principal part of preaching of the
gospel, is for a man to give faith unto the doctrine that he hears, and to
believe the promyses. When the lord Jesus had with these, and many other like
lessons, diligently enstructed his disciples, then the same twelve headmen of
the kingdom of heaven took their journey, and the mattier went forward, and
had good success. They preached unto all men that they should be penitent
for their former sins, and that no man should trust unto his own deeds and
merits, but only have sure belefe in the promises of the gohspell. And they
found sum that lystened and gave diligent ear unto their preaching. There
lacked not here a ready power to work miracles, which made their words to be
believed, though themselves were never so simple persons, and unknown. They
anointed the sick people with oil, and the same were healed. They commanded
the hurtful spirits to go out in the name of Jesus, and they went out.

That oil was not a medicine (for who heateth all manoure of diseases with one
medicine) but a sacrament. The skin was outwardly anointed with visible oil,
and the body was made whole. But their souls which anon after should be
delivered from the diseases of vice and sin, were to be anointed with the
oil of grace invisible, by our anointed Jesus Christ. Wherefore it was not by
virtue of such prayers, and enchauntme^tes as witches or magicians use, that
they cast out dyuels, but by words piththy and effectual through an
euangelike faith.

This was undoubtedly the very power of the kingdom of heaven. What was more
abject, vile, and lessere guarded then the Apostles were? But the less that
their power was the more manifestlye did it appear that all that ever was
done, came to pass by the might and power of God. They neither had riches,
learning, office, guard to defend them, nobility, fame nor authority. To be
short, they had nothing else but a plain and a simple faith in Jesus, whom
they as yet knew not perfectlye.

And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abro^^) I he said: John
Baptist is risen again from the dead, and therefore miracles are wrought by
him: other said, it is Helias, some said it is a prophet, as one of the
prophets. But when Herod heard of by^s, he said: it is John, whom I be
headed, he is tysen from death* agaynt. For Herod himself had sent forth
m^nne of war, and laid hands upon John, and bound him, and cast him into
prison for Herodias sake, his brother Philippes wife (because he had married
her.) For John said unto Herod: It is not lawfult for the to have thy
brothers wife. Herodias laid wait for him, and would have killed him, but she
could not. For Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just man, and an holy:
and gave him reverence. And when he heard him, he did many things: and heard
him gladlye. By these things, Jesus waxed every day more famous then other, so
that his name was now known even unto king Herod. For it is very late ere
kings know Jesus, whom it behooves first and chiefly to know him: neither
are there any that know him worse, and less for their soul health, then they
do. After that Jesus had wrought so many, and so evident miracles that no man
could cavil, and say they were feigned things: and the same miracles had done
so many men good, that no man could sclaunderouslye report and say they
were done by the power and operacion of evil spirits: And after diverse men
had diversely spoken their minds, and conceits what they thought of him, at
the length Herod showed also his opinion. John, says he, is risen from death:
and therefore now has he power to work miracles.

Again, other there were who taking conjecture of the prophecy of Malachy,
said how Jesus was Helye, which is promised in scripture to cum again before
the great, and terrible day of the lord. There were other sum, which denied
him to be Hely, who was of greatest authority among the Jews, auouchyng him
to be one of the mean sort of prophets reliued, and risen again. When
Herod had heard all their opinions, yet stacke he still unto his own, and
said: Yea, this is the selfefame John, whose head I caused to be stricken of.
He is alive again, and being now made a faynete, works such things as
passes man's power. There was none of all those which believed not that the
bodies shall reliue. And yet are there many at this day who believe not that
Christ rose again from death to life. And to thentent thou may here
perceive how unright are the judgments of the wicked, they believed that John,
who never had any name for workyng of miracles, was alive again: and most
stiffly denied the resurreccion of Jesus, whose godly power was so many ways
declared. Consydre also the fo^dnesse of wicked kings: Herod affirms John
to be alive again, and confesses he has now greater power then he had, when
he was first alive: and yet for all that he in a manor makes his vaunt how
he caused him to deputte to death, ready to slay him afreshe if it lay in his
power.

Here it is expedient to hear what occasion Herod had to commit so
heinous a deed. For at the prouocacion of an unchaste woman, he commanded John
to be taken, and laid in yrons, not for any offense committed on his behalf:
but to gratify Herodias the daughter of king Areta, the which Herodias,
notwithstanding she was married before unto Phylyppe one of the four rulers of
the countries of Iturea and Trachonitis, the King he father, by reason of a
certain debate that befell bewixt them, took away from his son in law
Philippe (by whom she had then a daughter) and married her to this Herod
brother unto the said Philippe, but yet his enemy. John, to thentent he might
the better resemble Helye, who very frankely rebuked Achab and Iezabela, could
not abide this unchaste and filthye matrimony, but said unto king Herod: It
is not lawful for the to keep still in house with the thy brothers wife, since
he is not barrayne, and is yet alive.

It is not lawful. etc.
Herodias, who was then divorced from her former husband, fearyng lest she
should by John's procurement by likewise divorced from this, went about to
entrappe him, and sought occasion to make him away, but all that ever she went
about, came to none effect. For albeit Herod loved not John heartily, yet did
he fear him. True virtue is of such force, that kings, and mighty princes
fear it. Herod knew right well he was a just manne, and an holy liver, and
therefore had him in awe and reverence, and followed his counsel in many
things, and gladlye heard him speak.

These things let the wicked womanne to destroy him according as she
purposed to do. She intended mischief, but occasion would not serve thereunto,
which is the thing, that only lacks unto yuell folks to do harm.

Now was Herodes birth day come, a time very propise, and meet to work
this ungracious deed in. It was besemyng that the natyue day of a wicked king,
should be polluted with the death of a man of most holy living and godly
conversation: and that the m^ddes of the excessive banketting and courtlye
delicacies, should be distayned with the cruel murtheryng of an innocent, and
gyltlesse person. Wherefore when that in the honor of his birth day, he made
a souper of gorgious, and excessive furniture, to the princes, capitaines, and
great estates of Galile, because there should be the moo present to bear
witness of his cruelty, there came into the place where they feasted, a young
damsel, daughter unto Herodias and Philippe, to make the geastes mirth and
pastime with her vncumly, and wa^ten dancing. And the more ungoodly she
daunced, the more she delited the geastes, and the king specially, who was now
twice mad, because, besides that he was in amors with the unchaste womanne
Herodias, he was also distempred, and set in a furye with wine.

Wherefore he said unto the damsel right magnifycentlye as became a king.
Ask of me whatsoever thou wylt, thou shalt have no denial thereof?

And to make her the bolder to desire what she would, Ask of me what thou
wylt. etc.
he bound his dronken promise with an oath. Whatsoever (says he) thou shalt
desire of me, though it be the one half of my realm, I will give it the.

Oh fond and folyshe saing, worthy to cum out of so folishe, and dro^ken a
kings mouth. But the young damsel, as she began to play this part at the
prouocacion and setting on of her mother (which diligently awayted the day,
place, and hour, and trymmed her daughter of purpose to dance) so durst she
not by and by tell the king what she would demand, but departed out of the
feasting chaumber, and asked her mother counsel, saying: The king my father
in law has bound it with an oath, that he will give me whatsoever I will
desire of him. What shall I therefore ask? Here was undoubtedly a just
occasion to doubt, and take good deliberacion, lest so great an opportunity
should have been lost. But the unchaste woman her mother, unto whom nothing
was so dear, as the death of the most holy and innocent man, without further
deliberacio^ taking, answered: Desire of him John Baptistes head. Oh wicked
daughter, soon taught, and ready to obey for a mischief. She returned
strayghtwayes into the kings privy chamber (for her mother privily advertised
her to make haste, and speak with Herod before that great heat of his
Princely courage were cooled again.) And then went she unto the kings
presence, and desired a reward for her wanton and lascivious dauncyng, saying:
I desire but one mess alonely, I will thou give me without farther delay,
John Baptistes head in a charger.

Here mark me well the aukewarde conscience of the wicked king. Where as there
is nothing that such kings are oftener wont to do, then to break all bonds
of leages, couenauntes, and religion: yet here he thinks himself bound in
conscience (which was a thing against all conscience) to perform his most
foolyshe oath, especially sith it was made in the audyence of so many
witnesses. Wherefore lest men would have thought him to have been a man of
no credence, if he had refused to perform what he promised by an oath to do,
And immediatlye the king sent ye hangma^ etc.
swearyng perchance either by his diadem, the spirit which had the
governance of his body, or the head of the damsel that daunced before him: or
else lest he should have seemee discourteous, and void of all good manners, if
he had either let the maid depart from him all heavy and sad, or with some
cloud of heaviness abated the myrthe and solace of the gestes, whom she had
pleased with her pastyme. (O worshypfull faith, and conscience: O good manner
and courtesy worthy to be put in Chronicles) lest I say, these things
should have chanced, the hangman was forthwith sent out, and the holy head of
the most innocente person brought unto the king, as it had been a mess of
meat in a charger. The king took it unto the damsel, and she to her mother,
unto whom it was a derer present, then the one half of Herodes kingdom.

With this deadly sight this folyshe dotyng and mad king, And gave it to the
damsel. etc.
did gratify the unchaste woman, and celebrate or worship his na^iue day. The
king caused him to be slain, the hangman brought the head to the king, the
damsel obtained it, and in conclusion the same deadly reward was given to her
mother the worker, and well of all this mischief. Oh worthy geastes all this
while, and mete for such a feast maker.

There was none of them al so frendely to the king, that would go about to let
him to do this mischievous deed. And shall we hereafter marvel if kings
other whiles be not a fearde to commit outrageous enormities, if they be of
disposicion like unto Herod, that is to say, enflamed with unchaste love, and
given to riot and sensuality, and over this, have such daily companions, as
be either fearful persons, or else favorers of their cruelty?

And when his disciples heard of it. and^.
When the brute of this haynouse deed was cum to the ears of John's disciples,
they took away the carkas, and buried it honorablye. Howbeit in these things
lies hyd some mystery and secret meaning. John although he bare the figure of
the law, and sygnified the same, yet in as much as he was a forecurrour of
the Gospel, he was rewarded with the reward thereof, that is, with a glorious
death, but yet far diverse from the death of Christ. For John's head was
privily stricken of after he had layne a while fast gyued in prison. Christ
was openly lyfted up upon the cross. The darkness of the prison agrees well
with the shadows and fygures of the law. It was mete they should give place
unto the light of the gospel, which began to appear and shine abroad. It
was conueniente that carnal ceremonies should be diminished, to the intent
that spiritual freedom should be increased. And it was likewise nedeful that
all, which proceeded of fear, should be bound, because the faith and charity
of the gospel, should the farther be spread abroad and extended. Finally it was
mete that man's head should be stricken of, least the church should
acknowledge any other head save alonely Jesus. And so the law being in a manner
slain, and honorably buried, gave place unto the Lord Jesus, when he began to
preach his spiritual philosophy and doctrine. For in that we do believe the
gospel we are much bounden unto the old Testament, which so many years
ago drew out Jesus Christ unto us, with shadows, and figures, and promised
and described him with the prophecies, and dark sayings of the Prophets.

Whiles these things were done, the Apostles after they had finished their
message, drew themselfes together, and returned to Jesus the head of the
whole business. All things proceed from him, and to him all things must be
referred. From him, after they had received their commission, they departed al
of one mind and accord, to thente^t that whatsoever it should fortune them to
do, they should likewise do it in his name: and to him they returned with
semblable concord of minds, desirous to have all that they had done, by him
approved. And so at their retourning they recou^ted unto him ye whole historye
and process of their legacion, severally rehearsyng every thing that they
had taught and done with great joy and gladness, And he said unto the^. etc.
and showing also how the matter had success even as themselfes desired. The
Lord after he had allowed their sincere faith, but yet restrained them from
glorying or rejoicing in their acts, took them away with him into a solitary
place, which was the wilderness of the town of Bethsaida, to thentent that
after their great travail and labor, they should there rest a while, and
sumwhat refresh themselfes. This going aparte into wyldernes was not for
recreacion and pastyme, but because they should quicken and renew the strength
of the spirit by secret contemplacion, and prayer, yt they might be the
more able to sustain such trauayles and pains as they should soon after be
put unto afreshe. For the teacher of the gospel must very little care for the
body. Moreover for as much as he that exercises the office of an apostle or
preacher of gods word, is compelled to have to do both with weak and
strong, with learned and unlearned, with good and bad, it can not be chosen but
he must other whiles be greatly wrasted from that perfect quietness, and
tranquillity of mind. And whenever it so chances, then must he sever his
mind from worldly matters, and wholly give himself to secret and most devout
prayers, and to purest contemplacion of heavenly things, that being made
stronger in spirit thereby, he may soon after return from this his godly
meditacion, to the help and comfort of his even Christen. For unto the place
where as at that season they found the lord Jesus, there resorted an
innumerable multitude of people, And he went by ship out of the way. etc.
so that it seemed as it had been an ebbing and flowyng of cummers and goers,
the which would suffer the Apostles being then weary by reason of their
journey, to take no rest: no not so much as to eat their meat. Wherefore
after the people were sent away, they took ship, and sailed to the side nighe
to Bethsaida, and from thence went with the Lord into a solitary place. But
neither chanced it them here long to keep themselfes close and secret. For
the light of the ^angelike verity can in no wise be hid. This going aparte
did nothing else but make the people more gredy to follow them. Some there were
who diligently marked whyther they went, that is, how they took their gate to
the wilderness marchyng on the city of Bethsaida: and byanby as it was noysed
abroad that Christ would make his abode there, a great multitude of all
sorts of people resorted thither a foot out of all the tounes there aboutes,
who made so good speed in their journey, that many of them came thither sooner a
foot, then Christ and his disciples, which had the vauntage of the water. A man would have said that the time had been already present, when the people
would go about forcibly to enter into the kingdom of heaven. When Jesus
perceived how an innumerable multitude of people was assembled together,
which had with very much pain and difficulty trauayled thither a foot, so
true is it that he gate him not out of the way, nor commanded them to depart
for their importunacie, that he came out of the secret place, where he was, in
manoure to meet them, going about to teach his disciples by sundry ways and
means, how they should at all times be willing and ready to set forth the
gospel. And so when the most gracious Lord Jesus came forth, and saw a very
great, but a confuse rablement of all sorts of people (for there were men,
women, and children) he was moned with compassion, and showed with iyes,
countenance, and as we commonly say, even with the very forehead, an unfeigned
sorrow of mind, fashionyng thaffeccion that ought to be in him, who is a
teacher of the gospel. The people thirsted after wholesome doctrine. And that
was plainlye declared both by the quick speed they made, and also by the
pains they took in their journey. Love made them swifte of foot: But they
were as it had been a sort of sheep wandering hither and thither, for lack of a
good shepherd. For the Priests, Phariseis, and Scribes, nothing regarding
their flock, fed their own belyes. Therefore Jesus taking compassion on these
simple, and disordered people, began to exercise thoffice of a faithful
shepherd. First of al he refreshed their minds with great abundance of the
meat of holy doctrine, and then immediately healed the sick folks, whom they
brought with them.

After that much time was spent herein, and now the thing it self gave a
watch word that the multitude had likewise need to be fed with corporal
food, the disciples following the mercy and pitiefulnesse of their Master,
advertised him thereof, saying: Lord thou see how a very great number of
people is cum thus far without any vitayles and purueyance. And this is a
deserte place, and meal time is past. They desirous to hear thy doctrine,
forget themselves, and can in no wise be severed from the. Wherefore let them
depart, to thentent they may repair into the country, and villages next
here about, to by them eats to eat. Then Jesus teaching his disciples how a
multitude should be fed, made answer: yea do ye rather who shall be
shepheardes in time to cum, now accustom your selfs to play the shepheardes:
give them of your own vitayles to eat. The disciples not perceiving for what
purpose he spoke these words, answered again according unto their rude
capacities, saying: Thou commaundest us to do a thing impossible. For thou
know right well, how slenderly we be provided of vitayles necessary for our
journey. Shall we go, and bye two hundred penyworth of bread for this
multitude, the which will not be enough to suffice them, insomuche that every
man shall scarcely have a little morsel to savor his mouth? Then Jesus
preparyng their minds by little and little unto the miracle, said: How many
loaves have you in store? and because they had not their answer ready: Go ye
(said he) and look how well ye be provided of vitailes. They looked, and
showed him yt there were five loaves, and two fyshes. It was not unknown unto
ye Lord what they had: but his will was, And he commanded. etc.
to have ye Apostles perfectly to know, how small s^oore of vitayles there was,
to thente^t they might ye more acknowleage Gods power in ye miracle. And
because they might the better discern what a great multitude and compaignie
there was, he commanded them to bydde all the people to sit down upon the
grene grass, so divided into compaignies, that in every co^paignie should
sit an hundred persons, or else fifty together. The apostles did as the Lord
bad them, and likewise the people were obedient unto the Apostles: so great
was the confidence they had in their guide, and shepeheard Jesus. Then took he
the five loaves, and two fyshes, and lifting up his iyes, according unto his
accustomed manor to heaven, gave thanks unto the father, thorough whose
beneficial goodness, the business of the Gospel did so well go forward.
That do^n, he brake the loaves, and gave the^ unto his disciples that they
should set them before the multitude. In like manner divided he the fishes
into sundry porcions, and gave them unto his said disciples, to be likewise
distributed among all the people. All were refreshed, and did eat their fill:
And they that did eat. etc.
none of them all lacked, inso much that after the feast was done, the
Apostles, by the Lords commandment, gathered together the reuersion, and
therewith filled twelve baskettes. Furthermore the number of the people (which
might easily be known, by reason they were thus divided into compaignies, and
satte in rows) was five thousand men, besides children, and women. By this
miracle Jesus both prescribed unto his disciples a form or rule how to
feed a multitude with the food of the Gospel, and also pulled out of their
minds all pensive carfulness to provide for corporal sustenaunce. Therefore
whosoever thou be that art a Bishop, Curate, or pastor of Christ's flock,
think not thus with thy self: I am a Doctoure of divinity: I am an excellent
cunnyng expounder of holy scripture: I have great store of learning wherewith
to enstruct the people, and may take enough out of my rich store house stuffed
with cunning, to feed them with all, be they never so hungry. Yea rather look,
and acknowledge how small store of vitayles thou have at home, for the which,
whatsoever it be, thou art a debtoure unto the Lord. But bring such store as
thou haste unto the hands of Jesus. Desire him to vouchesafe to handell, and
break it. That done, what he has delivered thee, the same do thou, even as
he took it the, minister unto the people as ye Lords meat, and not thine: and
minister it not mistrusting, not puttyng difference betwyxt this meat and that,
not trusting to thine own strength: and so in conclusion shall it be a very
euangelyke banquet, and the minds of the faithful shall be more refreshed, and
filled with this wholesome food, thus ministered by a simple person, then if the
supersticiouse Pharisey, the arrogant Philosophier, or eloquent Rhethorician,
would for the aduauncyng and setting forth of them selfs make unto the people
an artificial oracion or sermon, which they had diligently studied, and long
time provided for aforehand. Now for as much as he commanded his disciples
before to cum unto the ministry of the gospel, without any provision of
corporal food, here has he declared by very deed, how those shall want
nothing, who whiles their minds be wholly set upon the kingdom of God, and
the righteousness thereof, do not pass upon these temporal things, for the
which the common sort of people takes great thought and care, if so be there
lack not in them a sincere, and true faith in the Lord Jesus.

saw him, and were afraid. And anon he talked with them, and said unto them:
be of good cheer, it is I: be not afraid. And he went up unto them into the
ship, and the wind ceased, and they were sore amassed in themselves beyond
measure, and maruayled, for they remembered not the loaves because their hearts
were blinded. It was but a small benefit that he filled their hungry belies,
in respect of those benefits which they daily received of his most
bounteous goodness. It proceeds of a greater liberality to feed the mind or
soul, then the belly. And yet for all this the gross common sort of people
are wont (such is their unright, and aukeward judgment) to set most store of
all by that which is of least price and value. Therefore Jesus knowing it
would cumme to pass that they would now after their bellyes were filled,
imagine how to make him a King, compelled his disciples (for it was much a do
to sunder them from so lively, and amiable a Lord) to take ship, and go over
the water before him unto Bethsaida, whiles he in the mean while sent away
the people, He departed into amountayne to pray etc.
who^ being dismissed, he conveyed himself privily to a mountain there to
pray alone, and make peticion unto the father, that like as the affairs of the
gospel had begun well, and properously, so might they with like success go
forward. In the mean time the night approached, and the disciples sailed in the
mids of the sea without their master: and as they were sailing there arose a
tempest. How can it be chosen but there must needs be night, where that Su^ne
and light of the world Jesus, is not present? How can it be chosen but that ship
must needs be in ieopardie, wherein Christ lacks? How can it be chosen but the
Apostles must needs be troubled, when the comforter of all men, Jesus is away?
how can it be chosen but contrary wyndes must needs stay and hinder the
success of man's diligence, if Jesus help not forward? He is many times away:
but yet does he not forsake suck as be his unto the end. He seems sumtymes to
forsake them for a season, because to exercise them in aduersyties, and to
learn them to have sure belief and confidence in him. For now was he cum
down from the mountain: now stood he on the sea bank, but alone without any
company.

The disciples saw him not: nevertheless he saw them. Wherefore we must not
despair, what trouble or distress soever we be in: but in our hearts
conceive this steadfast belefe that the Lord (although he no where appear,
and show himself vysyblye) will not fail to help his when time requires.
He came unto them walking on the sea. etc.
Now stands he on the shore, and sees what labor and pain they take in
rowing. For the wind was against them. When therefore they had thus striuen a
pretye while with the waves and bousteous wyndes of this world, and were at
the next door to desperacion, about the fourth watch of the night, that is, a
little before the daunyng of the day, Jesus came unto them, not in a ship,
but quietlye walkyng on the water (for the element knew it maker) and made
semblaunt as though he would have passed by them. For so does he other
whiles suffer his to continue in aduersytie and tribulacion, as though he
passed not upon them at all, whereas in deed he never stynteth to care for
them.

The Apostles after they had spyed him in the dark walking upon the water,
forgetting so many miracles as they had seen him work before, and believing it
to be impossible for the liquid clement to bear the massy body of a man,
supposed he had been sum spirit or ghost, which had deceived their iye sight
with a vain and fantastical illusion. Wherefore they were sore afraid, and
for fear cried out. For they all saw the very shape and likeness of Jesus,
and yet believed not it was he. The Lord is ever terrible unto those that believe
he is an auenger, And anon he talked. etc.
and know him not to be a savior. Neither is it possible for him to be known
in the great darkness of this world, unless he bring himself into our
knowledge. Wherefore he suffered not his disciples to be any longer dismaide
with fear, but straigth ways spoke unto them with the voice which they knew
right well, and said: Be of good chere, it is I, fear ye not. And then came
he unto them into the ship, and furthwith the tempest ceased. Now after
their fear was past and gone, then began they to maruayle how a man's body
might walk upon the water. They were so dull, so rude, and forgetful, that
they remembered not so much as the miracle which they saw him work a little
before, when he filled so many thousand folks belies with five loaves, and
two fishes. And their hearts were so blinded, that they thought it a thing
much to be wondered at, to see Jesus walk upon the water: whereas in deed it
was a much more wonderful fact, to suffice so much people with so little
meat. The Lord suffered this brutishe dullness to continue in his disciples,
to the intent they also should enure themselves to bear with the dulnes, and
simplicity of weaklynges, till they were cum to more perfeccion.

In the daunyng of the day, they came unto the shore, and arrived at the haven
where they appointed to arrive, in the land called Genazareth. Jesus was
scarcely entered the land, but thither were cum diverse of the inhabitauntes
that knew him. For now was the sun disclosed, and the night gone, which had
darkened the minds of the disciples: and many there were who marked him,
whithersoeuer he went. Beside this he was now known unto very many, even by
the phisnamye: but a great mayny mo knew him by the fame of his doctrine, and
miracles. Now those that saw him, and knew who he was, byanby as though they
had cum as spies, departed away from him, and went through all the region,
And began to carye about i^ beds. etc.
and showed how Jesus was landed. As soon as this rumor was once noysed
abroad, very many began to carry about sick folks in beds.

And whithersoeuer Jesus went, whether it were to the country, tounes, or
cities, there was ever present a great number of importune and unquiet people,
more careful to be delivered of their bodily diseases, then to be cured of the
diseases and maladies of their souls: which laid out in the streets pitiful
sightes of sick folks, diseased with diverse sickenesses: and besoughte Jesus
as he passed by, that they might touch even but the hem of his garmente. For
there was such a business, and hurly burly among them, that hard and scarce
any one could be suffered so to do. It came not of any daungerousnes, or
difficulty on his behalf, that they could not touch him, who grutched not
to touch, and handle the Leper: but the ensample of their faith highly pleased
him, the which his pleasure was to have set forth and commended to all men:
and good cause why it should so be. As many as touched him were healed, what
diseases soever they were payned withal. They with perfect belief touched the
hemme of his garment, which afterward those persons chanced to have, who
crucified him, and put him to death: and by touching thereof, were rid of their
corporal diseases. How much more then ought all men to endeavor themselves to
touch Jesus himself with heart and mind, to the intent they may be healed
of the infirmities of their souls? Touching avail the nothing without faith.
The cruel Jews that buffeted him, that bound him, that scourged him, that
nailed him on the cross, touched his bare body: but that they so touched him
did nothing profit any of them at all. Thou readeste the gospel, and in so
doing thou toucheste Jesus: but thou readeste it to this end, to disprove it,
or else thou read it negligentlye, and take no heed ther^unto, and
therefore thou touchest Jesus in vain. Read it with a pure and a sincere
faith, and then shall thou anon be healed* But thou must sue unto Jesus by
prayer and peticion, that thou may touch him. That man is never the better
for touching him, whom he has not foretouched. If thou be not able to attain
that secret wisdom, which S. Paul speakethe of among such as are perfect,
then the hem of his garment touched, so that thy faith be perfect wall, shall
restore the to health. The hemmes of the Phariseis garments, be they never so
broad, are not of power and virtue to do the like. There is nothing so low in
the Lord Jesus, that through faith gives not health.

The.vii. Chapter.
THus went the gospel forward among the simple and lightly beleuyng people.
But it had not like success among the Scribes, and Phariseis, who thought in
their own conceiptes, that they had in their keapynge the castle of all pure
religion, and true doctrine: and scantly esteemed the unlearned, and ignorant
sort of the common people, for men. For of the priests there is scarcely any
where any mencio^ made, but when Jesus should be put to death. Therefore like
as in Comedies or plays there are diverse scenes, and pageauntes, to the
intent that by the comparing together of sundry persons and matters, every
thing may the playnlyer appear: so in this euangelyke business, the Lord
Jesus so ordered all things that were done from time to time, that it should
plainly appear to all men, after they saw how ready the simple people, and
Gentyles were to believe, how incurable was their froward obstinacy, who of
congruence, ought to have reformed other, if they had been hard of belief. To
the unlearned and common sort it was sufficient for the recoueryng of their
health, that they touched but the hem of Christ's garment. But the Phariseis
were never the better, neither for that they understood the prophecies and
foresayinges of the Prophets, neither because they had so oftetymes heard Jesus
preach unto them the heavenly doctrine, nor for so many miracles, as they had
seen him work before.

to say with unwashed, hands they complained. For the Phariseis, and all the
Jews* except they wash their hands often, eat not: observing the tradicions
of the elders. And when they cum from the market, except they wash, they eat
not. And many other things there be, which they have taken upon them to
observe, as the washyng of cups, and censes and brazen vessels, and of the
tables. Now after all this was done, thither came certain of the Phariseis
and Scribes in company together, forsooth a worshypfull sort of gentilmen, and
worthy to be had in great reverence: and the more a great deal because they
came from Jerusalem, where they bare men in hand that the well of godlynes and
holy doctrine was: whereas in deed there was the very well spring and head
of all ambicion, all hypocrisy, and all ungodliness. These fellows, because
they thought themselves ryghteous men, and well learned, came not hither to
learn any thing of Christ, neither to be healed, but to pick quarrels. And
lo, byanby was there a ready occasion for them so to do. This occasion (being
much desirous thereof) they took of the supersticious obseruacion of ceremonies,
whereof risen almost all quarelinges, and wrongful accusacions among
christian men. The Jews call that common which is unclean and unholy,
abhorryng all impuritie, and endeuouryng in no wise to seem to have any where
any manner of unclean or filthye thing. And this cleanesse they measured, not
by purity of mind (the which is the only, and true purity before God) but
by corporal ceremonies. And of these ceremonies a few were commanded by
Moses law, not to this end that they should be earnestly observed for ever,
but partly to the intent the ignoraunte, and disobediente people should by this
means accustom themselves to obey Gods commandments, and partly because
they should by such mauer (as a man would say) of shadows, and rudimentes,
be by little and title en^tructed to those things that belong unto true
godlynes, which is in the soul of man. Now sum of them not contented with the
ceremonies commanded by the law, added thereunto constitucions of their own
making, out of number, which the Phariseis more rigorously compelled the
people to keep, then such things as were commanded by God, always, and
every where to be observed. And for such folishe trifles, they challenged the
praise of holiness, and brought the people in a fond belief, that they were
made holy thereby, and finally (the which was a much wickeder deed) they
went about to forge a matter of ungodliness, or heresy against their
neighbor, for the breach of such ceremonies, thobseruacion whereof conduced
nothing at all unto true godlynes.

For when they saw certain of his disciples eat meat with unwashed hands,
And when they saw certain of his dysciples. etc.
that is, as they use to speak, with commune, and unclean hands, they
rebuked them as wicked persons, and their master too, who had naughtely
instructed them. They condemned not this fact because it was either of it own
proper nature vicious, or else forbidden by almightye God, but because it
disagreed with their use and custom. Assuredly the wurst rule that can be to
judge by, is to disalow any thing, because thou use not to do the same.

For it chances many times that the folishest things of all, grow to a
commune custom, which ought not in any wise to be made the rule of godliness,
in as much as purity is to be esteemed, not by custom, but by those things
which are true, and commanded by God. But the Scribes, Phariseis, yea, and
almost all the whole pack of the Jews, most folishely iudgeing purity of
mind to stand in corporal things, did contrary to this, supersticiously
observe the manner taught them, not of God, but of their forefathers, and
elders, in such wise, that if they had been in danger to sterue for hunger,
they would have eaten no meat, unless they had first washed their hands.
And if they be compelled to take their repaste often times a day, then wash
they often times, and therefore suppose that they cumme clean unto the table.
Further, if they return home from the market, then do they (as though they
had gathered sum filthe by touching of the people) wash their whole bodies
afreshe before they eat any meat: whereas all this while having their souls
most polluted with hatred, envy, ambicion, covetousness, hypocrisye, and many
other detestable vices, they never have any mind of washyng at all. These,
and such other like tradicions, were taught them of their forefathers, besides
the constitucions of the law, whereas the law expressly forfendeth that any
thing be either added* or taken away from Gods commandments. Neither
thought they it sufficient often times to wash their bodies, thereby to appear
the cleaner: They washed also their cruses, their brazen vessels,, and their
tables.

Now could they no longer keep in this foul scabbe of false reprouyng, yet
quarelled not they with the disciples, but assailed the master himself, as
though he had committed sum heinous enormitie. Why, say they, do not thy
disciples who follow the, and hang upon thine instruccion and teaching, keep
the custom begone of our elders, but eat their meat with unwashed and
unclean hands? Jesus intending to teach us that there is no more noysom or
mischeuous kind of quarrelling, then when a man under pretense of godlynes,
fyndeth fault with the well doings of his neighbor, sharply reproves their
malice, He answered and sa^ed unto them. etc.
and colored righteousness: By your deeds, says he, you plainly declare,
that the Prophet Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, full well, and worthily,
which make an outward show of holiness, whereas inwardly ye are replenished
withal sin and wickedness. In this Prophet, God complaynethe in this wise:
This people honorethe me with their lyppes, but their heart is far from me. And
as themselves do live, so do they enstructe other. I pass nothing upon this
cleanes of their bodies, and household stuff, but require of them inward
purity and cleanes of soul. They serve me in vain with this colored kind
of godlynes, auauntyng and magnifying it, as though it were a thing of great
worthynes, and wherein perfect godlynes did stand, teaching man's tradicions,
which make no man commemdable, and praise worthy before God: and of a
supersticious mind they have to observe the same tradicions, nothing passing
upon Gods commandments. Look how much differ^nce there is between God and
manne, so much differenc^ ought there to be between men's constitucions, and
Gods commandments. God is a spirit, and that which is spiritual and
ghostly continues for ever, and ought never to be neglected. Again, what
thing soever is corporal, the same lastethe but for a season. If it be lawful
to pass little upon the ceremonies which god himself has commanded to be
kept, whenever charity toward the neighbor exhorts so to do: How
much less then is it meet to break the commandments of God, for keeping
of man's tradicions? It is a wrong shapen godliness, and an unholy holiness, to
be supersticious in keeping of such ceremonies as your forefathers* instituted
and taught you of their own mind, and in the mean while little to regard
those things which God himself has commanded you to observe. You think it
to be one of the chiefeste points of godliness to wash your hands, your
cups, your cruces, and to observe many other like things, the which your
doings, by reason they have a certain counter^ayte apparaunce or visure of
holiness, do highly set you forth and make you seem praise worthy unto the
world: and this praise so gotten by colored holiness, you set more by then by
Gods authority. For you love your selves: and neither seek Gods glory,
nor the soul health of the people, whose guydes, and teachers you profess
your selfs to be.

Therefore it is no maruayle if ye disanull, and clean take away that God has
commanded to be observed of all men for ever, to thentent that man's
tradicions, which procure you great gaynes, and authority, may still
continue. Does not all the world see that you thus do? Did not god give this
law by Moses? Honor thy father, and mother: And he that curses his father or
mother, shall dye the death. This God commands not in one place, but does
often times repete it, and put every man in remembrance thereof, because that
children should to their power, help their parents when they be old, and
impotent, or fallen into poverty, or otherwise, so often as they are oppressed
with any manner of necessity, and by this means pay them home again, the
benefyte of their nourishing. The same thing the law of nature commaundethe,
But ye say a man shall say to father, etc*
which is likewise emplanted in many brute beasts, as in Storkes: But you
having an iye to your own peculiar vauntage, do with your feigned doctrine,
make Gods commandment of none effect: and require that this law (which God
would so feign have every body to keep) should give place unto your said
colored doctrine. God himself cryethe: honor thy father and thy mother: and
ye are bold to say the contrary: Honor not thy father and thy mother. You
cry not so with words, but you do it in very deed. So much the more
detestable is your wickedness, because you cloak the same with an image or
color of godlynes. For to the intent your treasury (wherewith all your
excess and pride is mayntayned) may be filled, you craftily alure whomsoever
you can, to bring very many gifts unto the temple, by defeatinge even of
their own parents, whom they should according to Gods commandment, succor
at their need persuading them that by this means the commandment is
fulfilled, as though the thing which is dedicated unto the temple, were
given to God, and that God were the very natural father of all men. Wherefore
unto him who has cast any money into the treasurye, you say, that he now
nedethe not to give any thing to the relief of his poor parents, because
the commandment is otherwise fulfilled: and in the mean while you so fear
the parents with vain supersticion, that they dare not require of their
children any thing, which semethe once dedicated unto God, lest in so
doing they should bring themselves in danger to be accused of sacrilege.
Doubtless God has no need of your money, neither is the same employed to his
glory, but turned to your own private commodity: and though it were
bestowed upon the buildynge of the temple, yet with God there is no temple so
holy that for the maynteynaunce thereof, he would have the children forsake
their parents at their n^de. Do not you, when that by such feigned doctrines,
ye both so deceive the children, that they refuse to help their parents, and
also so fear the parents that they dare not touch any thing once
consecrated unto the temple: do not you, I say, whiles you thus stablishe
and uphold your own commandments, dysanull and put out of place gods
commandments? This thing have I brought you forth for an ensample, which
ye cannot deny. But you offend not herein alonely. For in many other things
you do the like, as in that you now do. Gods commandment is: thou
shalt love thy neighbor as thy self. And you for trifling washinges taught
you of men, go a boute to surmyse mattiers both against me, and my disciples,
nothing regardyng gods commandment in this behalf.

After the Phariseis were with these words unto them privately spoken, rather
put to silence then cured of their maliciousness, he eftsoon called all ye
people unto him. For his pleasure was to have them all monished of the
premises, lest they should at any time afterward, have been by
Pharisa^call traditions, withdrawn from the purity of the gospel. Hear you
all (says he) and understand my words. You saw how I was accused of
heresy or ungodliness, for that some of my disciples did eat bread with
unwashed hands, as who say, he that so eats, were by such meat polluted
and made unclean before God. The cleanes, and uncleanness of man, standethe
not in outward, but in inward things. Neither can the soul of man be
defiled with corporal things. Therefore nothing that is without man, and
enters into the body, can make him unclean before god. But such things as
be within man, and cummeth out of him, declarethe him to be unclean. He yt
has eats. etc.
By this darcke saying, the Lord Jesus gave the people occasion diligentely to
ensearche what was the meaning of his words, and to make them more diligent,
he said moreover: whosoever has mete ears to hear, let him hear: meaning that
the foresayed song was songen in vain to the deaf Phariseis. But after the
multitude was sent away, and he gone into a house, then the disciples desired
him aparte, to expound them the parable of the difference between the things
entering in and cumming out of man. Jesus here folowinge then sample of a
faithful, and diligent scholemaister, after he had given them a little check,
and by that means made them to take better head unto his words, then did he
teach them the misterye, and secret meaning thereof. What, sayethe he, are
you also, whom I have specially chosen out to teach other, so void of
understanding? Truly ye your selves ought to have gessed what was meant by
this parable, by so many as I expounded to you heretofore. Perceive you not
that man's cleanesse and uncleanness can never be known by those external
things which enter into him? For whatsoever enters in by the mouth is not
conveyed into the heart, What so^uer th^^ from without enters into etc*
but into the stomach, and anon after into the belly: from thence, if there be
any thing that is unclean and filthy, it is avoided out into the privy: so
that to the eater every meat is clean, because nature purges whatsoever is
here unclean, and filthy.

But those things that cum out from the most inward parts of man, be tho that
both make and declare him to be unclean. The seat of the soul or mind, is
in the heart, and in the soul is true cleanesse and uncleanness. For this cause
he is not forthwith clean whosoever has washed his hands, but whosoever has a
washen, and a clean heart. Therefore all that cummethe from thence doethe
verily declare manne to be clean, or unclean. For out of the most secret
corners of the heart, do issue euel thoughts, aduoutry, fornicacion,
manslaughter, theft, covetousness, gyle, falsehode, unchaste lyuinge, a
naughty and an enuyous iye, raylyng words, pride, and folishnesse. The meat
which is eaten with unwashed hands, brings in none of all these enormites,
but they spring even of the man himself, that is to say, of the heart: and
when they once cum out, then do they plainly declare him to be unclean in
deed, whose heart is defiled with so many fylthy vices. If they be kept in and
hid, yet is the man nevertheless unclean, in the sight and iyes of almighty
God, who thoroughly sees the entrayles and bowls of the heart. But if they
fortune to come out either by words or deeds, then do they not only testifye
that the persons from whom they proceed are unclean, but also many times do
defile other mo, whiles that by the eyes, and ears, they enter and crepe into
the minds of the hearers and sears. Wherefore let your chief care be, to keep
your heart clean, and then shall it not skill, whether you eat your meat
with washen hands, or unwashed.

After these things were thus done, Jesus signifying even by the very
chaungeing of place, how weary he was of the Jewish honoring and service,
which was almost altogether esteemed by thovseruacion of folishe corporal
ceremonies, and coarcted within the very narrow limits of Iewry: signifiyng
also how much he desired to be at large among the Gentiles (where he should be
honored in spirit, and truth) gat himself thence and went into the borders
of Tire, and Sydon, but as a privy geste because of the envious Jews, who by
reason they counted the Tyria^s and Sidonians for dogs, and abominable
people, would not have suffered him to have translated and had away the
doctrine of the gospel unto them. Wherefore being there, he used not to be
conuersaunt in open and common places, as he was wont to be among the Jews,
but went into a house, as though he had been desirous to keep himself secret,
and unknown. Albeit he could in no wise so do. So greatly had the fame of his
words, and deeds spread abroad, and stretched forth it self, even beyond the
bonds and lymites of Iewrye, as though it had then devised to ouerrunne the
whole world. In this wise is the glory and praise gotten by leadyng a godly
life after the gospel, best of all spread abroad, when that of it own accord
it follows him, who exchueth and shunneth the same. For a certain woman of
Canaan, as this rumor was bruted, and noysed abroad of Jesus, came out of the
coasts of her country, and anon conceiving a great confidence of him, hasted
her to the place where he was: and being with much a do let into the house,
fell down at his feet. This womanne was not of the Iewishe, but of the
heathen religion: not a Iewesse borne, but a Syrophenisse. Here thou see a
figure of the churhe which anon after should be assembled and gathered
together of the gentiles. The Jews drove Jesus out of their country: but this
Syrophenisse forsook her country, and went to mete him. It is but lost labor
to cum to Jesus, unless thou have first forsaken thine old vices being now
familiar, and of household with the. Thou must flitte out of thine own house,
to thentent thou may cum unto the house where Jesus abides. This woman had
a daughter at home vexed with an yuell spirit, by the which daughter are
understand the people given to ydolatrie. Wherefore she desired Jesus that he
would vouchsafe to deliver her from the spirit. How much perfyter was the
faith of this heathen woman, then of the ruler of the synagoge? Jesus because
he would make the faith of this woman more apparaunt to all men, shaped her
an answer as though he had been of a Jewish mind, saying: suffer the
children, first to be filled. It is not besemyng that I take the bread of the
children, and cast it to dogs. For the Jews do glory, and make their vaunte
that they alone be the children of God, and esteem the gentiles, who are of a
contrary relygion to theyrs, for dogs. He calls the virtue of the gospel
bread, which by the heavenly doctrine, and pure faith, heals all diseases,
and expels all kind of devils out of menn^s sowles. The woman nothing
offended with this rebuke, turned his words into an argument to obtain her
peticion, the which he spoke (as it seemed) because to shake her of that she
should make no further suyre and request unto him herein. Thou sayeste very
well, says she, Lord. We heathen people have not disdain at the Jews, that
they (as children) do honorably sit at the table of their exceeding rythe
father and eat their fill of the holy loaves. But yet dogs are permitted to
eat the crummes which fall down under feet from the childrens table. Jesus,
as though he had been ouercum with so great faith, patience, humbleness of
mind, and constancy of the woman, answered, and said: By reason of this
answer thou obteyneste that perforce, which it was not yet time for me to
give the. Get the home, thy daughter is now delivered of the spirit. The
woman gave credence unto his words, and so departed thence with great joy
and gladness, and proved all things true, that Jesus told her. For she found
her daughter at rest in her bed, now clean delivered from any further
vexacion of the fiende. Assuredly the faith of the mother enforced Jesus to
heal the daughter. As Soon as the evil spirit is once put to flighte, then
folowethe there incontinent, quiet of mind and conscience. For that ever
follows innocence and clean life. So at this day the congregation of godly
folks, resorteth unto Jesus, and makes intercession for such as are no less
vexed with Idolatrye, ambicion, wrath, covetousness, and a furious desire to
make war, then if they were under the thraldom of some foul spirit. The
Jews thought it not beseming that they which a little before were enforced to
do all mischief at the will and pleasure of devils, should so daynlye
through the grace of the gospel, be received to the dignity, and fellowship
of the children of God: and the cause why, was by reason they perceived not
how this high preeminence ought not to be esteemed by consanguinitie or
kindred, but by feruentnesse, and constancye of faith, toward the Lord Jesus.
Christ was promised unto the children of Israel, and to the posterity or
successors of Abraham: But they are the posterity of Abraham which folowethe
faith of Abraham. They are the children of Israel which require not heaven
gates to be opened unto them for their merits sake, but go about violently
to enter in by force of an euangelike faith. For Israel is as much to say in
the Hebrew tongue, as a man strong or valiaunte against god. For when the
Gentiles (who before time were blemished with all kinds of vices, and had no
good deeds at all, whereby they might make any just title or claim unto the
kingdom of heaven) were by the justice of God clean excluded and shut out:
then brake they in by the window of mercy, and made themselves a way in by
constaunte faith, as it had been with some tool or weapon, violentlye
breaking up the walls of the same kingdom. The time was not yet come that
they should be openly called to the fellowship of the kingdom of heaven: but
yet the Lord makes many foresignes of their vocacion, as one desirous to
preuente the thing, which he chiefly desires.

After this sede was privily, and as a man would say, by stealth, so wen
among the Tyrians, Sydonians, and Cananites, the Lord reculed, and went
again unto ye lake of Galile: leauinge Sydon, and passinge alonge by the
country of Decapolie or ten cities, whereas before he healed a man vexed with a
spirit. And when he was hither cummen, they brought him a pitiful sight, that
is to wete, a man both deaf, and dumme. For he must needs be dumme, whosoever
is of nature deaf: But more miserable is his deafness, which lacks meet
ears to hear ye word of god. He is worse du^me, who has no tongue to
confess his own filthy living and gods merc^e. By the hearing of faith,
begins our salvation: and by confession of mouth, is the perfeccion of soul
health. The Jews albeit they daily heard Jesus speakinge, yet they hearing
heard him not, because folowinge then sample of a serpente called an Aspike,
which stoppethe her ears against the voice of the wise enchaunter, they
would give no credence unto such things as they heard. And therefore had
they a tongue to backbyte, and make ill report: but none at all to profess
the wholesome faith of Christ. But what shall this sely poor wretch do, who
has neither tongue to desire the Lord to give him health, nor ears to hear
that voice of Jesus, which reysethe to life even the dead? Other that had
both tongue and ears help him. They brought him unto Jesus: they besought
him of his gracious goodness, to vouchesafe to lay his hand upon him. So
plesethe it the most merciful lord to help sinners, even at the
contemplacion of other men's faith. The christian nouice is brought unto
Jesus. He has made an end both of ill doing, and naughtye speaking: but yet
has he not learned to do well: Yet has he not learned to confess the
goodness of the gospel. For how can he so do unless Jesus lay his hand
upon him? Men do but labor in vain if Jesus put not to his secret power and
virtue. The lord could even with the bare word of his mouth, have easlye
healed this deaf and dumme fellow: but this form of healing was set out for
our enstruccion. For like as ye words of Jesus are most commonly parables or
mysteries: even so be many times his doings too. He took him by the hand and
led him aside from the multitude of people. Safe is he whomsoever Jesus has
taken, and severed from the ruffling of this troublous, and unquiet world.
Then put he his fingers into his ears, and touched his tongue with his
spittell. Now is health very nere when Jesus by virtue of his spirit (which
is the finger of god) vouchsafes to touch the ears of our mind, when the
spettell of heavenly wisdom (which is himself) cumminge out of the mouth
of the higheste father, dayneth to touch the tongue of our soul, to thentente
that all godly things may rellise and savior unto us. For without this
humor, there is no taste: and if man's spettell be fautie, then makes it a
wrong judgment in tasting. This spettell does not only leuse the tongue,
but also open the iyes of the blind borne person, as often as it is mingled
with earth, and the iyes are therwithall anointed: whereas the spettell of the
Philosophers, and the Phariseis, doethe rather put out the iyes altogether. As
Christ did, so in manor do the teachers of the gospel. They take men and
lead them away from the multitude, when they call them back from the broad
way (by the which very many walk unto damnacion) to the fellowship of the
little flock of true Christians. They put their fingers, into their ears, when
perswadinge them to put no trust in things transitory, they stir and
exhort them to embrace the heavenly doctrine. They lay spettel upon their
tongues, when they exhort men to profess the Euangelike and Christian faith.

They lay on their hands, when they give the holy ghost to them that be
baptized: by whom their sins are taken away, and innocencye is conferred.
But the teacher doethe all this in vain outwardlye, except Christ work
within and send down his godly virtue from heaven. Jesus willing to show us
as it were certain figure hereof, when he had taken the man and first put his
fingers into his ears, and then spitte on his tongue, he lifted up his iyes to
heaven, and sighed. This sighing came not of any mistruste to cure the manne,
but was a passion or point if him that grievously bewailed man's calamity.

For what thing is more iniserable and wretched then they, whose inward ears
are so occupied and encumbred with worldly lusts, that they cannot hear the
word of God? Whose tongue is so entangled, and inferred with naughty
affeccions, that they savor not of heavenly things, but are altogether dumme
to confess their own sinfulnes, and dumme to set out the mercy of God?
Therefore the sighinge of Jesus, puts us in remebraunce in what case we were:
but his loking up into heaven, takes away desperacion showing us from whence
cummeth out ready succoure, and also whom we ought to reckon our selves bounden
unto* that we, which had before open ears to hear detraccions, ribaudry,
fond tales, Pharisaicall doctrine, opinions of Philosophers, and the
suggestions of the devil, have now the same opened, to hear the heavenly
doctrine of the gospel: and that, we which had before our tongue so infected
with the spettell of the flesh, that we lothed the delicate food of the
heavenly Philosophy: so tied with the devils bonds that we could neither
knowledge our offenses, nor serre out gods glory: do now confess how
nothing is due unto us for our deserts but only hell: and how it cummethe
whollye of the bounteous goodness of God, that we be chosen both to the name,
and also to thinheritaunce of the children of God. Wherefore let the priest
inlyke manor rather mourn, then rage against other men's sins: rather
sorrow, than be angrye. Neither let him challenge unto himself the power to
give absolucion: but look up to heaven, confessinge, And said unto him: Ephata.
and testifyinge thereby, that all that ever is done through sacrametall rites,
and ceremonies, is done by gods power alone, and not by man's. Jesus said
unto the man: Ephata, which word signifiethe in the Hebrewe tongue, be
opened: And by and by of his word there ensued a virtue. For anon his ears
were opened, and the band of his tongue was lewsed, and he spoke redily. They
had open ears, who after the lord said unto them (come after me) forsook all
that ever they had and followed him. They had a ready tongue, which after they
had received the holy ghost, spoke with sundry languages the wonders of god,
and answered the rulers charging them that they should not from thenceforthe
be so hardye, as to preach the name of Jesus, on this wise: whether we ought
rather to obey god then men, judge you. These things were done aside from the
people. For we must not make a wicked multitude witness bearers of out first
professing of the gospel, lest they have in derision, that they as yet believe
not.

Therefore Jesus charged them they should tell nobodye hereof, And ^e
commanded them. etc.
not for that he would not have his miracle disclosed and known, but because
the thing self does beter declare the power of god, then any publycacion, or
settinge forth of man. They all knew this deaf and dum person. Now he
heard, and had his conge at will. And so did he blase, even when he spoke
never a word of the mattier, the great benefit received of Jesus. Further,
Jesus was in this world conuersaunte under the shape and likeness of man,
because he would enstructe men, and teach them what they should do. What
thing soever a man does that is excellence, and praise worthy, let him
couete to have no words made thereof, to thentente that maimes glory may be
utterly suppressed, and only gods glory advanced. It is ieopardy to
magnify and ertoll manne, but the power, and goodness of God, is evermore
most worthily praised. Albeit neither is the glory and praise of man (if any
be due unto him) clean suppressed: Yea oftetimes the more it is avoided, the
more it folowethe. But a christian teacher must be of this mind, to desire,
as much as in him lies, to be known to god alone: and in so doing, he is the
more worthy to be praised to every body.

For whosoever destrethe glory and praise among men, the same in that he is so
desirous thereof, deserves to have none at all. Wherefore in that Jesus for badde
them which brought the dumme manne unto him, to tell any body what was
done, he thereby more provoked them to publish, and tell it abroad to all
men. And so much the more had they his greatness, and excellency in
admiracion, because that he, who both was able to do, and wrought in deed
such feats among them, did not only not require of them any mede or reward
for his labor, but also would not so much as take the fruicion of that glory
and praise, which he most worthily deserved, for so notable a miracle. But as
it is the property of him who is beneficial in deed, to require no praise for
his benefit: so is it again the part of a thankful person, so much the more
earnestly to render hearty thanks, because the authoure of the benefit looks
for none at all. Therefore those fellows reported every where of Jesus, saying:
He has done all things well, He has done al things well. etc.
and has restored to the deaf their hearing: and to the dumme, their tongue,
and speech. This praise is agreeable to none, but to god alone. No earthly
manne does all things aright. All the miracles that Jesus wrought, were
undoubtedly our benefits: which miracles if a man wey and pondre after the
outward apparaunce of corporal things, in deed there were many of them, that
far passed this, wherewith he made the deaf to here, and the dumme to
speak. But according to the spiritual meaning hereof, the su^me of a christen
man's felicity stands in this point, that with his ears he may hear the
words of the gospel, and then with his tongue, vttre, and speak what he has
learned, and given credence unto*

The.viii. Chapter.

THe Lord Jesus exhorts his disciples by diverse ensamples, to continual
beneficence and well doing, the chiefeste part whereof is to feed the
ignoraunte people with the doctrine of the gospel. Therefore he repeteth then
sample of feadyng, because the thing so often times prynted in their minds,
should in no case out of memory. For it fortuned on a certain season, that a
great multitude of people, came unto him to wyldernes, bryngyng with them many
sick folks, payned with diverse diseases. The most gracious Lord cured all
their corporal sickenesses, and fed their souls with the heavenly
doctrine. And by reason he was so ready to do good, he so wan the hearts of
the multitude, that they could by no means be severed from him.

And whiles their minds were wholelye fixed upon the kingdom of God, they
remembered not to make provision for vitayles, in somuche that when their bodies
were healed, and their souls fed, they were in great danger to sterue for
hungre.

Assuredly honger is a sore thing, especially when it chances among a
multitude. Jesus mindyng to teach the apostles by deed self that such shall
want nothing, as cleave unto him by sincere faith, said unto them: I have
compassion upon this multitude. For lo, they have been with me now this three
days, and have nothing to eat. If I send them away fasting as they be, it
is ieopardie lest they faynte, and tyar by the way, before they get home.
For sum of them came a great way hence. By these words Jesus provoked his
disciples to attend unto the miracle, which he purposed to work. Howebeit
they being yet rude, And his disciples answered etc.
and ignorant, had clean forgotten how that before he had fed a great
number of people with five loaves, and two fishes: and therefore answered in
this wise: Where should a man have bread here in wilderness to satisfy so
great a multitude, and so houngrye withal by reason of two days fasting,
although there lacked not money enough to bye it? Here thou hear an answer
of forgetfulness, and distrust.

Jesus asked them again: how many loaves have you? They looked upon their
vytayles, and answered, seven. Doubtless this was the true Euangelike bread,
not of barley, but of wheat, like as were the loaves before mentioned, wherewith
the children are fed, which is not cast to dogs. Barlie has in it his
proper fioure, but covered with a rough husk, or covering.

The five books of Moses called the Pentatenche, have also in them a
spiritual understanding, but the same is wrapped, and covered with darcke
figures. The nu^bre of the loaves was multiplied, but the covering was taken
away, in token that grace was increased, and ceremonies diminished.

Now whereas the disciples thought that these vitayles would not have been
sufficient for so great a multitude of people, Jesus, that notwithstanding,
commanded them all to sit down upon the ground. It is a blessed feast
where the hungrye multitude sits down at Jesus commandment. That is
done, whenever the people desirous to hear gods word, cum to the temple,
there to hear Jesus speaking by the mouth of a good preacher. For many do cum
with no more devotion to the sermon, then the common sort be wont to go unto
the stage, there to behold a play or interlude, of sum vnghostly mattier. He
that will have his belie filled with the loaves of Jesus, must sit down, and
that upon the ground. He must cum hither with quiet affeccions. They de^erue
not to be fed with this meat, which lie all at pleasure in the beds of the
Phariseis, and Philosophiers doctrine. O thou that art but earth, and ashes,
why art thou proud? why art thou puffed up with vain glory, by reason of thy
vain philosophy? why putteste thou confidence in these things, And he took
the seven loaves etc.
wherein is no safety? Know thy self: Humble and cast down thy self unto
the ground from whence thou camste. Let all fleshely lusts be settled, and
quiet in the: and then shall thou be filled with Christ's meat. All this that
I speak of was done. The whole multitude sat down upon the ground. Behold
now, and mark me well what Jesus does. He took the seven loaves, and to show
that all cummeth of God, whatsoever conduces unto man's salvation, he lifted
up his iyes to heaven (for there dwells the father, of whom he commanded
this bread daily to be craved) and gave him thanks: not taking upon him as
of himself, the authority of this ministry, lest pure manne should take
ought upon him. For he might justly have taken upon him this authority, as
equal with the father (albeit concerning also his divine nature whatsoever he
is, or has, he is debtour for the same, unto the father) but thensample that
he showed, was more expediente for our enstruccion.

After he had given thanks, he brake the loaves, and being broken, delivered
them unto his disciples: that even as they received them, so should they set
them before the people. Man's words are not pythy and effectual, except
they be handeled before, with Christ's hands. Thou haste eloquence: Thou haste
knowleage in pilosophie: Thou haste a good wit: thou haste knowleage in holy
scripture, in the laws civil, and canon: whatsoever thou haste, first
deliver it unto Christ's hands: let him bless, and halowe it: let him
break it: and then do thou minister the same unto the people: not as thine
own, but as received and delivered of him. For there are some, which break
the bread of holy scripture not as they ought to do, writhing and wresting it
to the lusts of man, and not to the will and pleasure of Jesus. For Jesus
doethe so break it, that the hungry multitude may be filled, and not that the
ambicion, and covetousness of princes may be therewith bolstred, and
maynteyned. Whosoever teaches the gospel for gain, or for to get glory, and
praise of man, or else for any other worldly affeccions, the same receives not
loaves broken of Christ. Therefore in preaching the word of God, and Christ's
gospel, let us follow his disciples. As Christ commanded them, so did they
set the loaves ready broken to their hands, before the multitude.

Here some manne will say: what, is there no meat? Is it only a bread
feast? And they had a few small fishes etc.
There must not be much added unto the loaves of the gospel. There is
nothing of more virtue and efficacy: nothing more sweet and pleasant in
tasting then they are: And yet through the bounteous liberality of the feast
maker, there are added unto the same a few small fishes. Paraduenture the
apostles will put hereto certain epistles, howebeit their puttinge to will not
be much, and a very small matier or trifle, in respect of the euangelike
provision. This addicion was permitted for the lothsomnesse of certain
persons: but we must require it no more. We ought to content our selves with
the meat already prepared, lest if any would still put to of his own
provision whatsoever him lustethe, it should then become the feast of men,
and not of Jesus Christ. For Jesus did likewise halow these little fishes, albeit
they were but few, and small, and commanded them to be set down before the
people, which thing if he had not done, they should not have been set before
them atall. Do not h^^e complain of the frugalitie, and slender provision of
meat: else if thou will permit the knackes and iunckettes of the Rhethoricians,
the royal dishes of the Philosophers, and the unsavory potage of the
Phariseis, to be served in, then shall it be ieopardie, lest the bread of the
gospel sauer not unto the mouth that is infected and brought out of taste
with so many sorts of diverse meats. Now that we may depart with full bellies
from this euangelike feast, let the teachers do as the apostles did, and
likewise the people, as did that multitude. What did the apostles? As they
received this meat of ye lord, so did they set it down before the people*
without any doubting, or reasoning. The multitude was also quiet, and received
it without murmuryng and grudgeing against their ministers, and took well a
worth whatsoever was given them. And so in conclusion, besides that every one
of them had enough, there were also seven bas^ettes filled with the meat that
remained when every man had eaten his fill. And they that eat, etc.
Moreover the people (which a man may more marvel at) that were satisfied
and filled here with, drue almost to the number of four thousand persons.
Certes this was the largess of gods word and the gospel. Whenever there
cummeth a proud teacher fournished with no small provision and furniture, as
well of liberal sciences, as of other good learning, laws, and constitucions,
so that he has in all things excedyng great skill and knowleage, crying often
that he shall not have time enough to prosecute his matier, that his audience
is not receyuable of so high mysteries, that he is drowned with copy of
matier, and stands in doubt where he may best begin: Do not we see it cum
to pass that his audience departs away hungry? much less then remains
there ought, when the feast is ended.

But of this frugall, and sparing feast of Jesus, there are left seven
baskettes full of broken meat, unspent. The abundance and plenty of the
euangelike feast, stands not in the multitude of sciences, as it were in
sundry kinds of meats so many in number, that the sight of them will take
away a man's appetite, and provoke him to lothsomnesse, nor in sauces made of
the mengling together of all manor of humayne and secular learnynges, but in
the virtue of the word delivered us of god, and truly ministered without any
fraud, or couine. When Jesus had thus fed the people, And he sent them away
etc,
then he sent them away. This is also sumwhat, happily to depart from the
feast or banquet of Jesus. So are they sent away, who render him hearty thanks:
who lay up his benefits in their souls, and there digeste the meat which
they have received: who after they be cum home (their bodies being now, as it
were well fed) do by good works doing, practice such things as they have
learned.

These things so done, Jesus forthwith departed thence, and hasted an other
way. The heardman must never be conuersaunt with his flock, but when it is
to be helped. He has healed the sick, taught the people, and fed those
that were in ieopardy to perish for hungre. After all these benefits sti^^ to
tarry with them, seems to be a point of such a one as looks for sum
thanks or gramercies. The necessity of the multitude, whether it be bodily,
or ghostly, is by all manor of means to be helped: but the nature of ye
people is such, that for the least good tournes of all, they are wont to give
most hearty thanks. It is the smallest benefyte that can be, to feed and
nourishe the body: it is a greater to heal it, and the greatest of all to
heal and feed the soul, with holy doctrine. None of them made him a king for
the doctrine that he preached* and the diseases he cured: But for meat, they
gave him a kingdom. And lest they would now have done the like again, he
departed straighte ways from them, And ye phariseis came forth, etc,
and taking with him his disciples (whom he chose because they should always
accompanye him) he took ship, and so came unto the coasts and borders of
Dalmanutha or Magedan. And that the unbelief of the Phariseis may the oftener
appear, they came likewise hither out of their country, not to be healed, but
to pike quarrels. For they had envy at his miracles, and envied also the people
which were helped with so many of his benefytes. For this cause they began to
reason the mattier with him, as though the miracles which he showed, And began
to dispute with him. etc.
had not been wrought by the heavenly power, because they were (as they said)
but base, and after a common cast. Wherefore in case he would have them, being
men far above the commune sort, and as you would say, heauenlike fellows, to
believe in him, they required him to show some sign from heaven, as Moses
obtained Manna from thence: and Helye brought to pass by his prayers, that
fire sodaynlye descended from the same place, and consumed both the burnt
sacrifice, and the wood, and to be short, all the water that was in the
trenches or cesternes by the altar.

The Lord knowing right well that whatsoever he had done, they would have had
a quarrel to him therefore, for if there had been any wonderful sign or token
showed the^ from above whereas the princes of darkness do reign, they might
with much more apparaunce of truth, have ascribed it unto Beelzebub, then
those things which they saw with their iyes, heard with their ears, and
handled with their hands, chiefly because it is a commune practice among the
expert in art Magike, And when he had sighed. etc.
to cause sudden showers, and dasshes of rain, thunder, lightnyng, hayle, and
tempest: the Lord, I say, perceiving this, sighed in his spirit, showing
thereby how woeful he was for their so obstinate unbelief. And as though he
had been in a fume, and chafed with anger, spoke unto himself on this wife:
What a froward nation is this, which after so many miracles seen, Uerily I
say unto you. etc.
yet nevertheless requires a sign, as though she had never seen none
before? Then he turned him to the Phariseis, and said: Of this one thing, I
assure you: there shall no sign be now given unto this nation, the which
only to tempt me, she requires from heaven. But she shall have a sign given
her that she looks not for, from beneath. And it shall be the sign of Jonas.
For this Jonas after he was swalowed up the space of three days, and believed
to have been dead, was delivered again out of the whales belly, when no man
thought it: even so the son of man after he has been hid about three days
space in the belly of the earth, shall rise up alive again, contrary to all
your expectacion and wening.

And he left them. etc.
When the Phariseis understood not these words, Jesus departed from them, as
from desperate persons, and returned unto the ship, and so passed over the
water: Thus the Lord Jesus desirous of man's health, often times changes
place, not seking for sacrifices, whereof he had long ago his fyl, but true
faith. This scarcely found he in the world, but yet every where rather then
among the priests, Scribes, Phariseis, and head men of the people. So ill does
the faith of the gospel agree with the^, that have the world at will.

Here, as they sailed, the disciples called not to remembrance how they had
forgotten to provide themselves of bread. For they had but one loaf with
them in the ship. Jesus perceiving how they were careless by reason of
forgetfulness, and not for the faith they had in him, gave them warning
thereof, and by that means caused them to be careful afreshe: Albeit this
their carfulness came not so much of distrust, as it did of an human
negligence, and forgetfulness.

For having their minds wholly fixed upon the words* and deeds of Jesus, they
had no remembrance of bread: and it was expedient for us that they so often
times forgatte how a great number of people was suffised with five loaves, to
thentent it should the deplier be fastened in our minds how those persons
shall want nothing, who with pure heart and mind, continuallye cleave unto
Christ. That ship is sufficientlye provided for, that has in it that one
loaf, which is Christ Jesus. Wherefore his pleasure was to stir up this
carefulnes in them, because he would heal them thereof. And for this purpose,
he gave them a charge saying: Look diligently that you beware of the leven of
the Phariseis, and of Herod. This word leven (which they heard, but wiste
not what he mea^t thereby) caused the^ now when it was to late, to be careful,
and take thought afreshe, how they should make provision for vitailes.
Therefore they began to whisper, and say softely: we have no bread. For one
thing brought another into memory. After they heard him once make mention of
leven, straightwayes it came to their remembrance that they had forgotten to
bye the^semselues bread. Of this matter they talked softely one to another, as
though they had made a fault through forgetfulness, because they bought no
bread. Howbeit this forgetfulness pleases Jesus very well, whenever through
the great desire we have of heavenly things, we forget corporal and worldly
matters. They feared left they should have been checked for their negligence:
but they were rebuked for their vain and superf^uous carpe and care. Wherefore,
says the lord, do you thus reason the matter among your selves, being
careful because you have no bread? Have you as yet, after I have enstructed
you with so many precepts, taught you with so many ensamples, and so often
warned you, no perceuerau^ce and understanding at all? Are your hearts yet
blinded? and be you in case, that you have iyes and see not? ears, and hear
not? Do you not at the least wise remember the thing which was twice done, of
late before your iyes? You saw, not long ago, how five loaves broken with my
hands, and dealte of you, suffised five thousand people, in such wise that
every body had his fill. And how many baskettes full of broken meat did you
then take up? The said, twe^ue. Afterward, when seven loaves likewise suffised
four thousand persons, how many baskettes filled you with the reuersion,
and meat that was left? They answered, seven. Then said Jesus: how then
chances it that sith you have been so often and many ways taught, you do
not perceive how this care for your food and living is superfluous: and that
the monicion which I gave you of the auoydyng the phariseis and Herodes leven,
pertains nothing at all to bread, but to thesche wyng of their doctrine,
lest you be likewise deceived as they deceive many a one. A very small piece
of leven makes al ye dowe sower, or sauery. If the leven be naught, then is
all the dowe marde. They make a show and semblant of godlynes, notwihstanding
they be very far from true godliness: and they dissent in opinions among
themselves, whereas both of them do shamefully err, and be out of the way.
For the Herodia^s do many times err by reason they be ignorant in holy
scripture, believing not that the bodies shall rise again: and all is because
they believe nothing, but what they se with their iyes: The Phariseis, although
they have the scriptures at their fingers end, yet blinded with evil lusts
and desires, do withstand true godlynes. You must be chiefly ware of their
doctrine, lest both your selves be infected therewith, and also other mo
hereafter, by the contagiousnesse of your infeccion. But embrace you the bread
made sauery with the leven of the Gospel, that you may likewise distribute
this pure bread to other.

In the mean while they arrived, and came to Bethsaida, and behold how every
where is ready matter and occasion ministered to show mercy. Here in a certain
street, they brought him a ^lynde manne, and desired him to touch him. This
blind body desired nothing himself, but intercession was made for him, by
other men. No man desires health of the Lord Jesus, but such a one as he
touches. For the first touch brings a man to the knowledge of himself. This
man was not pore blind, or a littell appayred, and decayed in sight, but as
bysome as was possible to be. They yt be so blind, have need to be led to
Jesus by other men, which by prayer may procure them theffectuall touch of
his holy hand. Jesus, who could with a beck have healed what blind manne
soever him lust, restored him not by an by to his fight, because he would
under a figure, show his disciples how much a do it is, ere such persons can
be brought to the knowledge of the truethe as of long time have continued in
their errors. Such a blyndnesse was the blindness of the Painims and
Gentiles, who so many hundred years, embraced the wurshippyng of Idols, in
stead of great godlynes. Such a one also was the blindness of the Jews,
which could not be made to forsake the supersticion received of their elders
whereunto they had so many years accustomed.

Therefore when the Bishop and preacher of Gods word, shall chance to mete
with such a blind man, what must he do? mark what Jesus did. First he took
the blind man by the hand. O blessed guide: but whyther did he lead him? he
lead him out of the town. That manne sets before his iyes the worste
ensample or patarne that ca^ be, whosoever follows the trace and steps of the
multitude. They favor themselves to their own peril, that say thus: I do
not this thing alone. Every man does so, as well as I. I had leauer play
the unwise manne with the multitude, then be wise with a few. Such as are
blind, are diverse ways in ieopardy, so long as they be among company. They
are laughed to scorn: they are run upon: they run, and strike against
other: they are thruste out of place, and have many a fall. Therefore first of
all the blind manne must be lead out of the place, whereas much company and
resort of people is. He walks now safely that has such a guide. What did
the Lord moreover? he spit in his iyes, and then put to his hands, and
touched them. Neither were his iyes, yet opened: so great was his blindness.
Then Jesus asked him whether he saw ought. As he had spoken the word, When
(...) had spit in his iyes.
the blind man lifted up his iyes, conceiving as it were sum little hope to be
restored to his sight, and said: I see men walkyng like trees. They that have
not yet perfitely received the light of the Gospel, whatsoever they see in
this world, seems much greater then it is in deed. They see a rich man, he
seems a plane tree. They see an head officer or a prince: they think they
see an Apple tree, or a Cypress tree.

They see a stoicke philosopher, with a great bearde, or a Pharisey trimmed
with broad hemmes and phylacteries: they believe he is a fygge tree. Now if
their iyes were cleansed, and things would show and appear unto them in their
propre lykenes, and as they be in deed, then should they perceive what manner
of trifles, and vanities, such things were, as seems so great unto him,
which is half blind. But the Lord who quenches not the smokyng flax, After
that he put his hands again upon his iyes.
nor forsakes him that has but half a sight until he seperfitly, did
eftsoon put his hands to the blind man's iyes, and forthwith he began to have
a clearer sight, and at the length attained such perfitenesse thereof, that he
saw all things clearly.

Blessed is he who having the iyes of his heart lightened by Christ, sees
every thing plainlye. Unto him those things seame least, which unto the
world appear greatest. Unto him those things seem foul and filthye, that
make the goodlyest show unto the world. Unto him those things appear
greatest, which seem vile and nothing worth unto the same. Whosoever thou be
that art a teacher of the Gospel, despise not the weakness of them which are
new beginners in learning the phylosophye and doctrine of the gospel. At the
first time it is enough for them to be brought out of ye town, that is to
say, to have departed from their old sins. Then must the doctrine of the
gospel be straight ways put forth, and preached unto them whereby their iyes
may be lightened: and first of all the rudimentes, and first principles of the
euangelike perfeccion are to be taught, upon the professing whereof, such as
enter into Christ's religion* and be nouices of the same may receive the
sacrement of baptism. Anon after, there must be taught them a more secret
and pithy doctrine, which shall make them to see, and perceive every thing
clearly. These things shall the ministers of Jesus Christ do. But Jesus
himself will vouchesafe to touch the blind man's iyes, with an hyd and
secret virtue, that he may receive his sight again.

And he sent him ho^e to his house.
After the Lord had done this good deed, he had the man return home to his
house, forbydding him to tell any body what was done. As often as he
commands any fac^e of his to be conceled, he teaches the priests thereby
how they ought not to seek for any praise and glory among men, if they
have done any thing well, and praise worthy, in the ministracion of the
gospel. Again if at any time he command his fact to be publyshed and
told abroad, it is a monicion for him that is healed of his sins, both to
knoweledge his own filthynes, and also to displa^e and set out the goodness of
god, unto whom only he is a debtoure, for that he is changed, and made a
new man. Now to return into his own house, is nothing else, but after the
time he has once received grace from heaven, not to forget what he was
before, and to what inconuensence he shall fall again, if he be not preserved
thoroughe the grace and beneficial goodness of almightye God. If it chance him
in his retournyng homewarde to cum into any town, that is to say, among a
sinful and a wicked multitude of people, which will rather laughe Christ's
religion to scorn, then believe in Christ, there ought he not vndiscretelye to
babble out the mysteries of our first profession.

Jesus said unto him: go unto thy house, and if thou enter into any town,
tell no body. He healed one before, which was both deaffe, and dumme. The
same fellow heard the word of the Gospel, and spoke redilye.

Now has he healed a blind man, who notwithstanding his sight be good and
perfect, yet is he commanded to keep silence among ungodly persons and
sinners, forasmuch as when he is cum home, the thing it self shall open the
miracle to such as knew him blind. For there is a time when it behooves a
man to profess the mysteryes of the gospel. Again there is a time when it
is better to concele the same.

Now makes he a trial how much his disciples have profyted ghostly,
proving whether such things be done in them spiritually, as in other have
been wrought corporallye, and by dark fygures. Therefore he departed from
Bethsaida, and went in company with his said disciples to ye little tounes
belonging to the city of Cesarea, surnamed Philippi. As he went by the way,
he asked them what the people supposed of him. For now after so many miracles
wroughte, even the common sort ought to have conceived some maruaylous great
opynion of him. Jesus was not ignorant what the common opynion was of him: but
his intent and purpose was, to show us which is the true euangelike faith,
that saves the faithful: and how much it di^^ereth from the inconstante,
and variable opinion of the common people. Whom (says he) do men say that I
am? The disciples answered plainly, as they had heard. Some men (quod they)
suppose thou art John Baptist, who is relyued again. Other some take the to be
Helye the Thesbite, whose coming was promised by Malachy the Prophet. And
again other there are, who think not that thou art Helie, Whom do men say
that I am.
but some other of ye old Prophets risen again from death to life. These
were the opinions of those men, who as then, had the greatest opinion of him.
For being themselves but men, they could suppose nothing of him above the state
and condition of man. They supposed him to be a man of great excellency, but
as yet they believed not how he was Messiah, the very son of God, and savior
of the world. Yet was this a rudiment and first principle (such as it was) of
the euangelyke and christen profession, the mystery whereof, was not as yet to
be disclosed to the common sort. For it being once discovered, no man can be
saved, save he which believes that Jesus is the author and original cause of
all health and salvation. The well of ye euangelike salvation, is a sure
belefe on Jesus Christ, the son of God, inspired us by the heavenly
inspiracio^. And to wring this belefe out of the Apostles, he said: The common
people, as I perceive, are wavering in their faith, having no constant opinion
of me, and yet have they a greater opinion of me, then such as said, I was
nothing else but a Carpentours son: then such as said I was furious and mad,
and sought me out to thentent to have bounden me with cheines: But whom say ye
that I am.
the^ such as said, I had the spirit of Beelzebub. But what say you, who be
of household, and of familiar acquaintance with me, and have been always
witnesses of all that ever I have done, and taught? whom say you that I am?
Then Peter the chief professoure of the gospel, made answer in all their
names, and said: Thou art that self same Messiah long ago promised of the
Prophets, the son of the living God, by who^ only halthe and salvation was
promised unto the world. When the lord had greatly allowed this open confession
of his, as inspired of God, and had given thereunto a worthy testimony of
blysfulnesse, and pronounced it to be the foundation of the church and
euangelike City, which no puissaunce of the deuell should ever be able to
shake: Then charged he them strayghtly, that they should in no wise discover
what they knew by thinspiracion of the father, before the time were cum. It
behooved that the people should awaite for Messiah and believe that he should
shortly cum: Howbeit as yet, it was not expedient to be known that Jesus was
Messiah. For thus was it necessary for one instruccion that glory should spring
of base and humble estate. The disciples of an humain affeccio^, abhorred the
displeasures of their master, much desirous to have him greatly esteemed and
taken for a ioly fellow of every body. But it pleased the everlasting wisdom
to observe the other order. Therefore Jesus began to teach them what he should
suffer, before he would have his greatness and excellency known unto the
world. The son of man (said he) of whom you have conceived so high an
opinion, must suffer great reproach, many pains and torments, be condemned
as a felon, of the Scribes, priests, and head men of the people: and in
conclusion, be put to a shameful death, as an evil doer, in somuche that
among wordly men, it is not possible for any manne to be counted more vile,
abiecte and desperate then he. But for all this, there is no cause why ye
should despair.

Keep steadfastly in mind your confession, which ye have made before me.
After they have persecuted me to death, I will rise and be alive again, on
the third day. And where as he had now and then before, sumwhat darkely
monyshed them of the premises, at this present he spoke his mind plainly,
because it appeared they could now away with such communycacyon, since they
had given so noble a verdicte and sentence of their master.

But for all that they could not yet abide to hear any mention of his death,
although they should thoroughe hope of his resurrection have taken comfort
again. The love wherewith they enbraced Jesus, was great: but yet was the same a
very worldely love, and an humayne affection. For as yet they had not received
the holy Ghost, which should make perfyte in them, whatsoever was imperfect.
And Peter ^oke him ^ side, etc.
Wherefore when Peter heard such fell and cruel words of condemning,
tourmentinge, and sleing, he was not afearde to take Jesus aside, as though he
would secretly monyshe him of some thing which should be for his weal, and
profit.

Forsooth this is man's wisdom, which oft^^^es studieth to go before the
wisdom of god. Yea he was bold to rebuke his lord, as though he had not
been well advised for that he would dye, since he might avoid death. And albeit
he believed he would be alive again on ye third day, yet he thought it much
better for him not to dye at all, then after death to reliue. This le^de tache
of Peter, although it proceeded of a certain hearty love toward Jesus, yet
did Christ openly, and sharply reprove, to thentente we should learn in all
things obediently to follow the will of God, and not with our fond judgment,
to go before his determinacions. It is not man's part to take Jesus aside, and
rebuke him, for fear lest he do, what he has determined to do. But we
ought reverently to beseech him, that he will vouchesafe to take and lead us,
whyther soever it please him. Therefore because he would clea^e wede out of
all their minds, this naughty affeccion, he first turned from Peter to his
disciples, and then beholding them (whom he knew right well did not dissente
in opinion from their spokesman, though he bolder, and more presumptuous then
the rest, was not afearde to speak his mind) he rebuked Peter again, of
whom he was rebuked before, saying: Why let thou me Satan? That word in
the Syrian tongue, signifies an adversary: as who say: Why doeste thou that
art but a disciple, assaye to go before thy master? Thou that art a man,
attempt to go before god? follow rather behynd. This is not man's business which
is now in hand. Thine affeccion and love is as yet a wordely affeccion:
neither sauerest thou of those things which are of god. If thou will be my
disciple, it becomes the to follow my death, and in no wise to hinder it. And
not the alone (albeit chiefly thee and the other who^e I have specially
chose^) but also all ye will profess themselves to be my disciples.

When Jesus had thus spoken, he commanded the whole multitude to be present
with his disciples, lest any should suppose that those words pertayned only
to these specially chosen persons. And when they were now all together, Jesus
spoke unto the^ with an audible voice, on this wise: Many there be which do
follow me rather with feet, then by imitacion of life. Neither do all men come
to me for one cause or purpose. For some are enticed hither by the novelty and
straungenes of my miracles: some with the desire of bodily health, and other
some by a great desire to hear my doctrine. But whosoever will be a true follower
of me, if he intend to be associate with me in bliss and glory, let the same in
the mean time dispose himself to be my fellow or partener, in sufferyng
affliccions, and death. Let him utterly renye himself, reserving nothing unto
himself in this world, but clean renouncyng all things even to contempt of
life: and finally let every man take up his cross, and follow me. Let not the
disciple be ashamed to follow his teacher, nor the servant to follow his
master. Neither let any intend to come to glory by any other way or mean
then that, by the which he shall se me go thither before him. Whosoever thinks
that he has in himself whereby he is able to attain salvation, shall perish.
And contraryly, whosoever distrustyng all his own aids, wholly puts himself
to my mercy, shall be saved. For it is not enough for my sake little to pass
upon lands, tenementes, parents, wife, and children: but life it self (for
the preseruacion whereof manne forgoeth all that ever he has) must likewise
be forsaken.

Be ye of good comfort: that never perysheth which is given to me, no rather
ye shall preserve that by losyng, which you should otherwise lose in deed by
evil keeping. Through faith of the gospel, to all men is given life
everlasting. Therefore he that sets more by this present life, then by the
grace of the Gospel, although he seem for a time to win the same, yet does
he in very deed, lose it. For no man can here prolong his life beyond the
time appointed. Albeit, to say the truth, neither in the mean time, and
before his death, lives a man in deed, except he live well and virtuously.
And after this life (which to all men is very short and transytory) he shall be
condemned to everlasting death. Now, whosoever for my sake, and for that he is a
steadfast professor of the gospel, puts his life in hasarde of death, shall
preserve it by me, which else should verily peryshe. Therefore, if there be
nothing so dearly beloved of man in this world, but he will be content to
ransom temporal life with the loss thereof, debatyng the matter with him
self in this wise: what shall it avail me to have house, lands, goods,
precious stones, wife and children preserved, if my self peryshe, and shall
not enjoy that I am owner of* Though all these things be in safety, yet do
they perish to me ward, if I fortune to dye. For what thing can be so dearly
beloved and much set by of man, yt is not to be contemned for the preseruacio^
of life?

If one would offer another as great riches and treasure as ever had Mydas,
and Cresus, the beautye of Absolone, the Monarchy and empire of the whole
world, and finally all sorts and kinds of pleasures and therewith say: take
these things, and dye: would not the other byanby refuse this offer made him
with such condition, and answer again? I love my life alone, better then all
these things. Sithe, I say, that every manne doethe wisely consider these
things with him self, so often as there is any immine^t danger of bodily
life, why do they not then more earenestly look upon, examyne, and way the
matter, whenever it concerns that life inestemable? Now everlasting life
is proffered unto thy soul: and will thou not exchange therefore the short,
and wretched life of the body? especially sith that every manne shall another
day receive his own body again, restored to a more blessed life? All men
must not of necessity dye for the profession of the ghospel: but yet every
manne ought to be ready in will and mind so to do, to the intent, that if the
case require, they may pass nothing upon corporal life, so that the life of
the soul may be saved. Whenever the storm of persecucion aryseth, then must
this cross be taken up. Albeit neither, even when all things be quiet, and
persecucion cease, shall any manne be without his cross, unless it be
counted an easy thing to renounce all natural affections, with all worldly
pleasures and inticeme^tes, to cut of the inordinate lusts of the flesh, to
bridle excess, to repress sensualytye and pleasure of the body, to subdue
hastines, and let pass reuengemente. For these things also must every
manne do, that will be my disciple, even at that time, when the world is
most quiet, and without busynes. But truth it is that the world shall with
all manner of engynes rise against those which profess my name, and threten
them with reproach, banyshement, imprisonment, torments, attayndour and
death. For this is a naughtye nacyon, and shall ever have in it more
reprouable, and naughty disposed persons, then good men: among whom it shall
be counted the greatest offense that may be, to profess my name. And if any
manne, the world being thus set, and bent against me* will be ashamed to
confess himself to be my disciple in this ungracious, and conterfeite nation,
where after short afflyction follows everlasting blysfulnes, him the son of
man will requyte, and be likewise ashamed to take him for his disciple, when he
shall eftsoon cum, not low, and contemned as he is now, but wonderful and
merueylous in the royaltye and glory of his father: not accompanied with a few
poor disciples, but environed with innumerable companyes of holy Angels.

The.ix. Chapter.

THey shall not be partakers of this glory, who will not now suffer the infamy
of my cross. The Jews looked for a merueilous kingdom of the children of
Israel which they supposed should begin, as soon as Messiah was come, and
therefore they could not believe that Jesus was Messiah, because he came so
poorly, and like an outcaste of the world: and much more were they offended
with the mention of his passion and death* They understood not how there were
two cu^minges of Messiah, ye first which after the estimation of the world, was
low and reproachful, and another full of majesty, and glory, which shall be in
the end of the world, to thenten^ he may join unto him his whole body,
delivered from all evils in the glory of the father: and throw down Satan
with all his members, into the fire of hell. He would that the day of his
latter cumming should be vncertainne to all men: but yet would he have every
man to be in a readynes against the same. Therefore forasmuch as there were
some among the people which by inward imaginacion said thus to them selves:
when shall this time of glory cum which he promises? And peradventure many of
them believed not that it should ever cum at all: Jesus stablished their
wavering minds with such words as here ensue: Be ye right well assured of
the thing I told you, that the son of man (whom ye now see humble and
low, and very shortly shall see more abject then all other) shall appear in
the fathers majesty, with all his holy Angels, and chosen disciples. Neither
is that time so far of. For there be some here in this company, There be
certain among them that ^a^de here. etc.
who or ever they dye, shall perceive that the kingdom of God is already come
with power.

Therefore let every man make himself ready, to thentent he may be found
worthy to be of the same kingdom. These words that the Lord spoke, the
Apostles themselves as then understood not, because there was in them double
understanding. For after his death, resurreccion, and ascencion, and after the
sending down of the holy ghost from heaven, then that virtue of the corn of
musterdsede, that is to say, of the Euangelike doctrine, began to show and
put furthe it self.

Now because the disciples should put no doubts, but he would once perform
what he promised concerning the majesty of his second coming, his pleasure
was to give them some taste thereof, and that before their death, so farfurthe
as man's nature was able to receive or away withal. Wherefore after six
days, Jesus took unto him three of his twelve specially chosen disciples, as
the chief and worthyest persons: unto whom his pleasure was to show this
fight, because they would make no words thereof, till the time were come that
they might lawfully disclose it. These were Peter, James, and John. Them only
he took away with him into a very high mountain. For they must be far
from all carefulnes of low and yearthly things, whom Jesus vouchesafeth to
show such a sight unto. He dayneth even in these days to give by secret
inspiracion, unto certain elect persons enhau^ced to the mountain of pure
contemplacion, some taste, and sight of the everlasting blissefulnes.

The people which abide benethe in the plain, know nothing thereof, and if a man tell them, they believe not. When the Lord, and his disciples were come
to the top of the mountain, first of all they fell to their pray^rs. For
prayer is the thing which chiefly prepares the iyes of the heart, and makes
them meet to behold such a sight.

And lo, as Jesus was in his prayers, the shape of his body was suddenly
changed. And he was transfigured* etc.
For his face, which before seemed not to diffre from the common physnamy of
other, shone as bright as the sun. Then did his clothes glister with
whytenes, surmountyng the whytenes of the snow: such as no fuller can by any
craft make the like upon clothe. Neither was Jesus seen thus alone, but with
him Hely, and Moses talkyng together. It was Moses office to talk with God.
And we read how Hely, was taken up and carried into heaven with a fyery
charyot. And there appeared unto them Hely as with Moses.
Doubtless their communicacion with Jesus, signifies the agreement of the law
and the Prophets. For the law shadowed and drew out Christ with mystical
fygures: and the prophets showed before by their prophecies, how Christ
should come such a one, and like in all points as Jesus came: and yet the
Jews would not believe. The matter whereupon they talked, was his glorious
death and departing, which he should in short space after fulfill at
Jerusalem upon the cross, so that here the mention of death did likewise
assuage that exceeding great pleasure, whereof man's mind was in no wise
receyuable. Peter being raui^hed with this unspeakable sight, And Peter
answered etc.
and therefore not well able to rule his affectes, brake their communicacion
begone of death, saying: Master speak no more of Jerusalem: Here is good
being for us. Therefore let us make.iii. tabernacles in this place, one for
thee, another for Moses, and the third for Hely.

These words of Peter, partly proceeded of the fear of death, which was
depely soncken into his mind, and partly of the great pleasure he had in
beholding of his sight, wherewith he was, as it were dronken. For like a man
beside himself and rauyshed of his wits, he wist not what he said. So great
was the fear wherewith these mortal men, not yet receyuable of ye divine
majesty, And there was a cloud that shadowed them etc.
were astonished. Therefore because they should not be overcome with this passing
great bryghtnes, there arose a cloud which ouershadowed them, and tempred
that insufferable light, so as they might away with it. This taste of the
divine majesty, was given to their corporal iyes. There was also somewhat
given unto their ears. For there sounded out of the clouds, the fathers
voice, being likewise full of majesty, which said: This is my most dearly
beloved son, give care unto him.

Now, how for very shame do the Jews to this present day, speak against
Christ, since both Moses, and Hely, which are of greatest authority among
them, bear him witness? since the father (whom they would be seen devoutly
to serve and worship) gave by his voice, And a voice came. etc.
the whole authority to his only begotten son. The Apostles were delighted
with this glory: but let him that will come thereunto, hear Jesus when he
exhorts to the imitacion of his cross. O Peter, do not thou from
henceforthe rebuke thy Lord: do not thou go before Gods determinacio^. Thou
heardest the fathers voice, which said: hear him who is my dearly beloved
son, as who say: hitherto you have heard Moses, and the Prophets
prophesying of Christ, they have now played their parts. He is alredie cum
whom they promised. Hereafter give no ear unto such as promise things to
cum: but hear you him that is present, and speaks my will and pleasure. No
man shall speak truer things. Whatsoever disagreeth with his words, that
utterly refuse you.

Anon as this voice of the father was heard, all things were suddenly
changed again into another shape and lykenes: for when they looked reu^de
about them, And suddenly when they looked round about. etc.
like men awakened out of their sleep, they saw not one jot of all that ever
they saw before, save alonelye Jesus, who was present with the^ again,
having the self same shape that he was wont to have. He showed them his
greatness only through a cloud, and they were not able to behold it. What
would they have done, if he had showed them his very hyghnes and majesty, even
as it is in deed? Therefore Jesus eftsoon humbled himself to their lownes, and
forsakyng the top of the mountain, came down to the rest of his disciples,
and the multitude. Here remember thou that art a preacher of the gospel, how
much more it becu^meth the to humble and abase thyselfe to the capacity of
the weak, the which wast once like weak as they be: and if thou have any
high or excellent qualitye in thee, the same is Christ's, and none of thine.

As they were cummyng down from the hill, or ere they camme to the multitude,
the Lord Jesus forbad those three to tell any body what they had seen, till
after the time that the son of man were risen again from the dead. Other
heretofore when they were likewise commanded to hold their peace, did so much
the more blase abroad those things which they were charged not to disclose.
But these.iii. because they heard the fathers voice saying hear him. etc. did
as they were commanded, keep secret what they had se^e, insomuch that they
disclosed it not to the residue of the Apostles before the time appointed. They
wyste not what the matter meante: but yet they supposed there was some earnest
cause, why Jesus would not have it published unto the people before his
resurreccion were known. For what other good should they have done by tellyng
it abroad, but made themselves a la^ghyng stock unto they faythles? Who would
have believed it to have been matter in deed, that Jesus had appeared in such
wise, sith men should se him sone after put to so much shame and villainy,
and in conclusion suffer death upon the cross? But the disciples (who durst
not after they had once heard the fathers voice, distruste the words of Jesus)
not understanding what he meante by these words ensuing: When the son of man shall rise from death. etc. fell to reasoning the matter among
themselves, and supposed verily that incontinent after his resurreccion, the
glory of that kingdom should begin, whereof they had now taken a say:
howbeit there was a certain scruple or doubt which made much against them,
and that was, because his death was at hand, the which he had often times
warned them of before, promisyng he would relyue on the third day after
the same.

But they had learned of the prophecy of Malachy, how Hely should come before
the great day of the Lord. And because they could not assoyle this doubt
among themselves, they moved the question to Jesus: Lord say they thou have
performed thy promise: We have seen the brightenes of the kingdom of God.
And demanded one of another.
Therefore we believe that after thy resurreccion, thou will cum in semblable
likeness, and such a one as thou diddeste whylere appear unto our sight. But
what is the cause that the Scrybes, taking their authority of the prophecy of
Malachy, do say, that the same day shall not come, unless Hely the Thes^ite
come before, to make the people in a readiness against the cumming thereof,
lest the Lord smite al men with cursyng? Certes Hely, whom we saw with the
in the mountain, is not yet come. Neither is there as yet any thing done by
him. Therefore, either the kingdom of God shall not come byanby after thy
resurreccion: or else there is an other sense and meaning of the prophecy, then
the Scribes do teach. Unto this question of the disciples, He answered and
said unto them.
the Lord Jesus made a doubtful answer, for that they were not as yet
receyuable of the whole mystery hereof.

For abhorryng those things which pertayned a great deal more unto their
salvation, they dreamed only upon the glory of that kingdom, whereof they
had taken a taste: perceyuinge not how this is also the kingdom of God, when
the holy ghost (the gospel being sprede abroad and every where preached)
subduethe all the puissaunce, both of this world and also of our ghostlye
enemy the devil. That kingdom began to appear, what time the lame walked,
the blind saw, the dumme spoke, the lepers were cleansed, and the devils cast
out. Now when this kingdom should come, whereof they had a little before
taken a taste, the Lord would not have them to know: yet to thintente they
should more pacyentely take his death, whom they loved out of measure, he
suffered them to dream for a while, that the bryghtnes of the same kingdom
should shortelye cumme, whereof there was a say given in the mountain.
Therefore he temperethe his answer so discretelye, that he approves the
prophecye, and yet does not altogether condemn the interpretacyon of the
Scrybes, but only reproves their ungodly argumentacyon, whereby they concluded
that the kingdom of God was not yet come, because that same Hely, Helyas
verily when he co^mmeth first, restores. etc.
which was promised long ago of the Prophet Malachy, had not as then
appeared in the world. For now the spyrytuall kingedome of God (which thing
the proud Scrybes and Phariseis understood not) began to come. Now was Hely
after the mystical understanding already come. Therefore Jesus said: both
that which Malachy prophesied of Hely, and also that which the Prophets
spoke before of the son of man, shall come doubtless. You read of Hely how he
shall come before the great* and dreadful day of the Lord, to turn the
hearts of the fathers, to their children, and the hearts of the children to
their fathers, to thentent that the younger sort and posterity, may perceive
how that is already come and performed, which their forefathers and elders
awayted for. Therefore this Hely going before, restore the all things, and
amendethe whatsoever is not right, lest the Lord come to the great mischief
and vengeance of all men, if he find them unprepared. And ye son of man as
it is written of him. etc.


But like as the prophecy of Malachy speaking of Hely the forecurrour is true:
even so are the prophecies of other Prophets like true, which foretell how
it shall cumme to pass, that the son of man or ever he show his majesty,
shall suffer many things, shall be set at naught, be mocked, and in conclusion
put to death. Yea, to say the truth, whatsoever was prophesied of Hely to
cumme, is already accomplished, and fulfilled: the which thing being as yet
unknown unto the Scribes and Phariseis, But I say unto you y^ Helias is cumme.
I disclose unto you my dear friends. For Hely is already cumme, who showed
how the kingdom of God was present, and moved all men to be repentaunt for
their former life. And yet, this notwithstanding, they which boaste and crake
upon the perfect knowledge of the prophecy, knew him not: And they which
loved better their own kingdom then the kingdom of God, delte by him, not as
he deserved but as them lyked. For he camme according to the prophecies of
Esaye, and Malachy, crying in wilderness how the great and terrible day of
the Lord, was present, how the axe was already put to the rote of the tree,
and that every manne should spedely endeavor him self to avoid the
vengeance of God cumming. But this Hely (who openly without regard of person,
rebuked every man's vices) they despised, and put to death. Neither will they
more gently entreat Messiah, then they have done his forecurroure.

Hereby Jesus declared how John was Hely, not after the body, but after the
similitude of spirit: who, whiles he neither spared kings, ne phariseis, was
cast into prison, and beheaded. As they did by the forewalker, so will they
do by his Lord: The same thing will they likewise do by those Apostles, that
shall follow him. For whosoever has sincerely preached that gods kingdom
should cumme, the same has suffered many affliccions of the ungodly. And whosoever
syncerely preaches y^ it is already come, must needs suffer the like. With
these words Jesus called back his disciples from ye dream of glory, to the
remembrance of the storm that was to cum, and hanged over their heads, that
is to say, from pleasant things to necessary.

In the mean while that they had thus commoned together, they were come into
the sight of the people, at what season a great multitude, were gathered about
the disciples, whom Jesus left beneath in the plain. He saw also the scribes
reasonyng ye mattier, I wot not whereupon, with his disciples. Now when the
people had espied Jesus unlooked for on their behalf, forasmuch as he had
preuely conveyed himself away with a few of his disciples, they were
astonyed, and met him cummyng full and whole, and saluted him.

Jesus was not ignorant what the scribes disputed on, but yet he asked what
the mattier was where upon they reasoned, to thentent that every body might
know what was done. And (...) etc.
And when both ye disciples and the scribes held their peace for very shame,
the disciples for that they assayed to cast out a devil and could not bring
it to pass, and the other because that in the presence of the disciples they
depraved the name of Jesus, as a thing vertulesse, and of no efficacy: one of
that multitude who ministered the occasion of the ^^asoning, showed the whole
matier even as it was, unto Jesus. Master, says he, I brought hither my son
unto thee, who is vexed with a dumme spirit, of whom he is pitifully
tourmented. For whenever the spirit, teketh him he dasheth him against the
ground, and then the child fometh at the mouth, gnasheth with his teeth, and
cries out, and all this while he pyneth and consumes away, by reason he is
thus vexed. Because thou wast not here I desired thy disciples that they would
chase away this spirit, and deliver my son. They assayed to do it, and
could not.

When the lord heard this, to show, that feebleness of faith was the very
cause why the young man was not delivered of the spirit, he making as though
he had been wroth and in a fume, said: O faythlesse nation which yet can
not by so many miracles as I have done, be brought to belefe. How long shall
I living here in earth, strive with your unfaithful obstaclenesse? how long
shall I bear with you? when will you come forward in those things that be of
the spirit? when will you believe those things that you see not, sith you
believe not the things which you see with your corporal ^yes? bring him
hither to me. And they brought him unto him. That sin cleaves fast, whereunto
the sinner has from his chyldehood accustomed. But after he was brought unto
Jesus, he was wurse vexed then he was before, by reason of the conflicte which
arose between the spirit desirous to amend, and sensuality tollyng and
alluryng him again, to his accustomed sinful living. For anon as the fiende
saw Jesus, he feelyng a contrary power to his, took the young manne, and
soore vexed him, insomuche that being dashed against the ground, and rolled
to and fro, he fomed at the mouth. This was a pitiful sight, to all the
people. But it is a much more pitiful sight when the sinner possessed with
grievous su^^es and of long continuance, is likewise vexed in soul. Howbeit
there is no sin incurable unto Jesus.

The Lord because the other should also know in how evil case he was,
asked his father how long it was, since his son first began to be thus
vexed: he answered again, of an infant. And the spirit does not only,
says he, thus vex him, as thou see, but also casts him oftetymes
headlong into the fire, and many times into the water, because to destroy him.
Here thou hear a very sore and cruel malady turned into nature: But if thou
can do any thing. etc.
and therefore the father feared lest it had been incurable. For he said
moreover. But if ^ou be able to do any thing have mercy on us and help us.
He did well to desire the mercy of Jesus, who could allege no merits: howbeit
thou hear a waueryng faith, when he says: But if thou be able to do any
thing. etc. That faith Jesus refourmeth, saying: doubt thou not what I am
able to do. For if thou could believe, there is nothing but strong and
steadfast faith may obtain it. As Soon as Jesus had said so, the father had
better hope and comfort then he had before, and declaring the great desire of
his mind with tears, and weping, said: I believe lord, and if my belefe be
imperfect healpe thou my weakness.

In the mean season, the people came runnyng together on every side, to see
this sight. When Jesus saw they were come (for his will was to have them all
to be witnesses of the miracle) then put he furthe that almyghtie voice
wherewith he calletth to life again when it pleases him, even the dead. He
threatened the foul spirit to handle him accordyngly, unless he would
incontinente depart, saying: Thou deaf and dumme spirit, I charge the to
get the out of the man, and that thou never from henceforthe enter into him
again. Jesus is in a fume with the spirit because he may show mercy upon the
man: geuyng us a lesson what we ought to do in healyng of sinners. A man must
so rebuke vice, that he may seem to love the soul health of the person. And
because we should know that man labors and speaks in vain, unless Jesus
speak with him by his secret virtue and power, the disciples commanded the
spirit to go out, but all was in vain, because Jesus was away. He is away
so often as our faith is cold and wavering, by the which faith, his will is that
we obtain all things. What was done at the emperious voice of Jesus? By and by
the spirit went out.

But to the intent it should appear that he went out against his will, he
cried, and vexed the sely wretch very sore at his departure. For now lay he
upon the ground for dead, in somuche that many said he was dead in deed. Thou
see here a figure of a penitent person, and him who turns from great and
accustomed sins, to amendment. Now has the hatred of sin delivered him
from sin: howbeit he is at the next door to despera^ion, whosoever both
knowleageth his own filthiness, and also has gods justice in remembrance.
But yet lies he happily dead that is dead to sin. For then remains there
nothing else, but that he begin to live again to righteousenesse. And this
benefyte gives also our most bounteous savior Jesus without whom there is
no safety. He caught the fellow by the hand, and lifted him up as he lay in
this trance, and furthwith the same, who before seemed dead, recovered his
former strength: and through the benefit of Christ rose up strong and
lusty. But unless Jesus had now given him new grace to lead a godly life,
it had been to no purpose that he was delivered from the dyuell at the
contemplacion of his fathers faith.

Now hears this deaf manne, which before had his ears stopped with
worldely lusts against the doctrine and word of the gospel. Now speaks
this dumme fellow, who before was tongue tied and speachelesse by reason of the
passions, and wilful pangues of the flesh. Now is the same at rest and
quiet, who before styred with the furious rages, sumtime of sensuality, and
pleasure of the body, sumtime of ambicion* and desire of worldly aduau^ceme^t,
others whiles of wrath, now of envy, now then of covetousness, was as it had
been ravished and carried by the constraynte of sum unclean and violente
spiri^e. All these things saw the Apostles, and said nere a word, for that
they durst not interupt the lord. The Scribes also held their peace being now
assured by the thing self, how it was not by reason the name of Jesus was
ineffectual and vertulesse, that this fellow was no sooner ryd of the spirit,
but for the weakness of faith. And as it chanced unto this young manne bodily,
so chanced it to the Pharise is spiritually. They were not healed of their
sins because they believed not the word, by the only v^rtue whereof, they
might have been healed. But when Jesus was cum into the house, the disciples
now being with him alone, asked him what was the cause why they could not cast
out the devil, sith they had before cast out so many in his name. For they were
disquieted in mind, with a certain humayne carefulnes, lest they had unawares
offended the Lord, and by that means lost the power, which he once gave
them to work miracles.

Jesus who is not wont to take away again, what he has once given, but to
encreace the same (yet will not he have his gifts negligently kept, and after
a rechelesse sor^e: and now has he sufficiently declared, in the father of
him that was healed, how weakness of faith was the only impediment why the
devil went not forth, the which faith was not as yet so strong in the
disciples, as it ought of congruence to have been) Jesus, I say, answered,
that there was a certain special kind of dyuels, which could not otherwise
be expelled, then by prayer, and fasting. For these be the two engynes which
are of most force against wicked spirits. For by prayer, the strength of
faith is renewed and quickened, as it chanced unto the young man's father, who
said Lord help my unbelief: And by fasting because it contains a certain
forbeatyng of all carnal pleasures, the rebellion of the flesh is subdued. He
must have a clean spirit himself whosoever goes about to cast out unclean
spirits of other. Jesus and the three disciples, were newly returned from
prayer. The rest of them kept compaynie with the multitude, and did neither
fast, ne pray, and for that cause were not able enough, to cast out a
dyuell which had so fast hold, and was so familiar. The more the trust of
our selves increases in us, the more the power to work miracles decreaseth:
The more the power of the flesh is mortified in us, the stronger is the holy
ghost by whose only power, soul spirits are expelled. We must therefore often
times pray that the strength of faith may in us be increased: we must also
mortify our flesh continually, to thentent that the spirit of Jesus Christ
may live in us. To be short, Christ doethe now prepare his disciples
against that hour when they shall be commanded to watch, and pray lest
they fall into temptacion. But because they took a nappe after supper, the weak
flesh had the upper hand.

unto them: whosoever receives any such child in my name, receives me. And
whos^euer receives me, receives not me but him that s^ut me. These things
done in manner before rehearsed, Jesus being accompaignied with his disciples,
began to take his journey to Iewrywarde, who pryuily, and as it were by
stealth, passed through the countreye of Galile, not because he feared death
(which in deed he most feruentlye desired) but left he should have seemed to
provoke the priests, and Phariseis to co^spyre his death before the time
appointed. This outward apperaunce of fear showed he, because he would clean
deliver his disciples from all fear, and also declare the weakness and
frayltie of the nature which he had taken upon him. As he went by the way, he
repeted unto them the same thing which they had diverse times heard him speak
of before. For he said as follows: That must needs cum to pass, which I
have so often times told you: the son of man shall be delivered into the hands
of men to be taken, condemned, mocked, scourged, and slain* You must make your
selves ready in mind against the cumming of these things, which undoubtedly
be at hand. But it is impossible for any of you so to do, unless the same be
free from all worldly affeccions, and be also stablished with the strength of
the spirit. I know that the mingyng of death troubles you very sore. But you
must be of good comfort, and take men's hearts unto you. I will not long
forsake you. For I will be alive again on the third day. The disciples were
so dull, and feeble wytted, that they understood not these words (not
withstandyng they were plainly spoken) supposyng there had been sum dark
mystery in them, because it came to their remembrance, how they had been
sumtymes before deceived with such figurative manor of speakynges, as when
they were commanded to beware of the Phariseis leven. Neither could they yet
conceive in mind the misterye of the cross, nor guess for what purpose he
would be slain, if he would soon after his death relyue again, sith that he
who can relyue when him lust, can also if it please him, not dye at all.

Therefore albeit they were greatly offended with these words, yet durst they
not ask him any question, And wet af^ayed to ask him. etc.
feared with them sample of peter, who to his displeasure, questioned with the
lord herein. For they heard Christ say unto him: Go after me Satan: They yet
sauoured of the world: for gods determinacion was to be reconciled to
mankind (pardoned of all his offenses through faith) by the sacrifice of an
unspotted lamb. The disciples dreamed upon a certain worldly kingdom, and
therefore as they trauayled by the way, they fell a reasoning among themselves,
who should have the prem^^nence, and upper hand in the kingdom of God,
which they hoped should very shortly begin. They saw a little before, how the
three disciples were preferred before the rest in going up to the Mountain:
they saw how Peter had the preeminence when the keys of the kingdom of
heaven were delivered, and yet sum of them were his auncientes, yea and
besides that kynne unto the Lord. And he came to Capernaum. etc.


When they were cum to Capernaum, the Lord asked them aparte what was the
matier whereupon they reasoned secretlye between themselves, as they went by
the way. But they holding their peace, and ashamed to make him an answer (for
they knew well that he being the author of all modesty and humbleness of
mind, would disalowe this their ambiciousnesse) Jesus because he would clean
wede out of their minds, this most damnable and naughty affeccion: sat him
down as one that would teach sum earneste mattier with authority, and
commanded them all twelve to cum unto him, and then said: If any of you
desire to be the first or chief man in the kingdom of heaven, the same shall be
last, and servant to all: so far wide is it, that the kingdom of heaven
ought to be esteemed after this worldly kingdom. And anon, because he would
the depelye^ fasten this doctrine in their minds, he called unto him a little
child, and set him in the mids of them. And when he had embraced him,
signifying thereby how much he defied proud persons, and loved such as are
humble and meke in spirit, then said he unto them: Do you see this little babe?
what is more abject and vile, after the estimacion of the world? yet they that
are such in humbleness of mind, simplicity, and godly living, as this is in
age, those do I set most store by. For reason will that I love them best,
which be lykest unto my self. This prerogative is not esteemed by riches,
revenues, power, statelynesse, and violence. For such as have these things,
as they most resemble heathen princes, even so are they highliest esteemed of
the same. Like as earthly kings believe that they are either honored, or
dishonored in their great estates: so in this Euangelike kingdom I think my
self to be either honored or dishonored in such little babes, whom the
world sets naught by because of their innocence, simplicity, and
humbleness of mind. If you know any to be more humble and low then I am, him
count ye for the chief manne in the kingdom of heaven. But if ye find none,
then take you me for the very sovereign: And as every man most resembles me
in con^^mning of those things, which great men sue for in princes courts, so
judge you him to be the most sovereign person. Therefore whosoever receives one
of such little babes, in my name, the same receives me. For it reioyseth me to
be received in those, whom I love as them that are like me. Again, whosoever
receives me being lowest of all men, after the estimacion of the world,
receives not me, but him that sent me. For as the master is honored or
dishonored in the scholars: so is the father likewise dishonored or honored
in the son.

By these words, Jesus took not away authority from such as be prelates, and
have the charge or ouersyght of the Lords flock, but plucked out of the
disciples minds, all desire of worldly auauncement. For the lowness of this
sort of little ones, is not esteemed after the quantity and strength of the
body, but after the humbleness of such a mind as claymeth nothing in this
world that is high, nor trusts anywhit to his own strength, but with
sincere faith hangs upon Christ.

By occasion of these words, there arose an other doubt among the disciples,
the which John propouned in this wise: Master (con he) when thou sentest us
out to preach the kingdom of God, we saw a certain fellow cast out devils
in thy name, and yet was the same neither of the number of the twelve, nor of
the seventy, whom thou dyddest afterward chose, and send out, nor none of
all the disciples, which follow us. Wherefore him, as one of an other sect,
and none of thy fellowship, we forbad: but whether we did well or no, we wot
not. Jesus answered: Forbid ye none such as are in any wise good to sprede
abroad, and preach the gospel. For you must not be disdainful in receiving
of those, which go about, by what endeavor soever it be, to auaunce the
word of god. You must not consydre whether he follow me as a disciple, but
whether he preach my name. If he cast out devils by calling upon my name, he
cannot lyghtelye speak yuell of me. And if he so do, then will the thing it
self reprove him. For it shall be said unto him: how dare thou for very
shame backbyte that name, which thou have proved mighty, and effectual in
working of miracles? Therefore do ye not upon light occasion suppose him to
work for a naughty purpose, whosoever does a godly deed. He that resists not
the gospel, in this point furthereth it, because he aydeth not them, which
take part against the same. Whosoever is not against you, makes for you. This
new doctrine must beeset forth whenever occasion serves: but with what
synceritie of mind it be promoted, it is no mattier to you, so that the
preacher do by any manor of means further the business which you go
about. For not only they shall be rewarded for furtheryng of the gospel
which shall cast out devils in my name, but they also who according to their
abylitie, will put their helpyng hands never so little to the aduauncyng
thereof. For whosoever will give you even but a cup of cold water in my name,
that is to say, in respect that ye are my disciples, and do my business, be
you right well assured, the same shall not lack his reward.

Again if any shall chance to let them, by whom the gospel is aduau^ced
(truly it is advanced not by those whom the world counts great, but by little
ones, simple persons, underlings, and men of no reputacion) if any, I say,
offend any of these little ones who have reposed their affiaunte in me, so true
is it that he shall not avoid punishment, that he should be much eassier
punished, if there were a mylstone tied unto his neck, and he cast into the
sea. The princes of this world cruelly punish such, as let their deputies to
put those things in execucion, which they have commanded to be done. They
hang them on a ieobet, and also many times quarter them, or cast them down
headlyng from sum high rock, or else drown them in the sea with a stone tied
unto them, for cumming up again: so true is it that they will not have their
great men offended, whom they use as ministers of their tyranny, that is to
say to oppress the people. But God will much greuouslyer punish such as
will let his little ones (whom he would to have the handelyng of thaffayres of
the heavenly kingdom for all men's salvation) that they cannot put their
kings commandments in execucion. For albeit they shall seem for a time so
to do unpunished: yet at the leangth shall they not escape the punishment of
hell. The tyrauntes of this world could invent no kind of death comparable
to that punyshemente, whereby both body and soul shall seem to dye with
continual tourmentes, and yet never can dye. Therefore study you not how to
be revenged. Do your business, and God shall punish those that will let you.

Now if there arise any let and impedimente, not of any persecutoure, but
on their behalf, which appear to be your friends, there ought nothing to
be so dear unto you, Wherefore if thy hand hinder thee etc.
that the love thereof may cause you to leave of the ministracion of the
gospel. Admit it be thy right hand, that is to say, thy father or very
nere friend, whom thou canste not spare: put case it be thy right eye, that
is to wete thy well-beloved wife, and sweet children: Admit it be thy foot,
that is to say, thy servant, or factour, whose service thou can not lack
for thexploiture of such affairs, as thou have to do in this world. Cut of
thy hand, pluck out thine iye, chop of thy foot that hyndreth thee to do
the business of the gospel. If thou canste bring with the to the euangelike
salvation thy father, thy mother, thy brethren, and thy systers, do it. But if
the tender affeccion thou bear toward them, withdraw the from the
ministracion of the gospel: and again if it should so come to pass that
whiles they refuse to be saved by thee, thou should also perish, and be
damned with them, then cast away natural affeccion, and let the charity of
the gospel ouercumme the charity of ma^ne: do the same thing in peril of thy
soul, that thou would do in the ieoperdie of thy body. If thou were at
such an exigent, that thou should either be slain, or else thy life be
saved with the loss of thy hand, thou would not stick in this case to
choppe of thy hand and so with the loss of one membre, were it never so
necessary, to redeem thy life. It were a thing more to be wished to attain
salvation with thy parents, and friends by the gospel: but if that can not
be brought to pass, then is it much better for the to forsake thy parents
(who do not only refuse to be saved themselves, but also go about to bring
thee to like confusion) and so to enter into life everlasting, as a man would
say, maimed, then with thy said parents, and friends to be cast in to hell,
that is to say, into fire which can never be quenched. There the worm
repentance that gnaweth the conscience of the wretched creatures, dies not.
For they live only to their tourmente and pain. There the fire wherewith the
damned souls are tourmented, is never put out. There shall both thy parents
and thou repent, but to late, and in vain: thou, for that thou folowedst their
unlawful affeccions to thine own damnacion, and they because they would not
be advertised by the, when thou exhortedst them to salvation. Neither shall
their calamity help the, nor thy torment any thing release or diminishe their
pain. Moreover, the damnacion of the parent that would not be saved, shall not
be laid unto his charge who hastened to do the business of the gospel.
Likewise after this manor cut of thy foot, consydering with thy self that it
is better for the to cu^me halt and lame to life everlasting, then with whole
feet to be thrown into hell, where neither the fire can be quenched, nor
the worm dies.

There is nothing dearer to man then his iye, And if thy foot be an
hinderaunce etc.
nothing more pleasant, then wife and children. But if thou be brought to
this strayte, that either thou must needs for their pleasure forsake the
gospel, and be damned with the^: or else forsake them, then whom (as touching
worldly affeccion) there is nothing more dear unto the: in this case stycke
not to pluck out thine iye, and cast it away: reckening it to be much
better for the, to enter with one iye into the kingdom of heaven, where there
is life eternal, then to have both thine iyes whole, and with them to be
thrown into the fire of hell. Let not here the weeping, and waylyng of thy
wife, nor the sweet words of thy children, any whit move the. They are fools
to weep because they are forsaken, since they might have followed the if they had
would. All worldly affeccions must be set aside, when gods commandment
compels it so to be. All losses of corporal things ought to be counted for
gaynes, whenever everlasting life is to be purchased. It is no delicate and
pleasant thing to profess my name. Persecucions, and worldly affliccions
shall arise on every side which may withdraw you from your purpose. But such
as take in hand the ministracion of the gospel, must vanquishe all these
things. He that will be a mete ministre or preacher of the euangelike
doctrine, must wholely yield him self to the will of God, to thentent he may
in no wise, neither for fear of persecucion, nor by reason he is corrupted
with any enticementes of fleshely appetites, swerve from the pure verity of
gods word, and the gospel.

For as no sacrifice after the law of Moses is lawful save alonely that
which is salted either with fire or salt or else with both: even so whosoever
will profess the phylosophie and doctrine of the gospel, must needs be
pourged with fire from all worldly affeccions, and be also poudred with salt,
that he may in no wise be corrupted with the infeccion or contagiousnesse of
yuell men. Worldly wysdom is vertulesse and unsavory, and neither preserves
him that has it from worldly corrupcion, nor yet is of force to preserve
other. Now must the teacher of the gospel, do both: that is to say, both
find the means that he be without corrupcion himself, and also take away
the same from other. This can neither be done by the philosophers wisdom,
nor by the Phariseis doctrine, but only by the virtue of the euangelike
philosophy: which with the tartenesse of truth byteth away, and consumes
what thing soever is in man in danger of corrupcion. The same thing does also
that fire of the spirit of God, which likewise consumes all carnal
affeccions, and purges men's souls thereof, yea, and in manor transformeth
into God, what thing soever it has once caught, in so much that they who
were before time entangled with the cares of worldly vanities, are now
(the same utterly contemned) all together ravished with the lone, and desire of
heavenly things. Whosoever is seasoned with this salt, can by no manor of
inticementes be corrupted, and fall from the purity of the spirit of the
gospel. He that is pourged with this fire, will despise whatsoever the
persecutoure can threaten him withal.

There is nothing better then fire if a man use it aright: nothing more
profitable then salt. Salt is good. etc.
But if the fire be cold, if the salt be made unsavory, and vertulesse, what
then remains to season the unsavory, and simple people with all? If they
that profess the spirit of the gospel, frayed with the threateninges of
men, do forsake their profession, and for fear of displeasure, feed and
uphold with their flattery the folly of princes, whom their duty had been
boldly to rebuke, what hope then remains? If such as profess the salt of
the gospel, do not only not heal the corrupt affeccions of other with the
tartenesse of truth, but also fall themselfes for their parents and friends
pleasures, and because to obtain earthlye vanities, from the hope of the
kingdom of heaven, and win hell, expouning and wrestyng the doctrine of the
gospel (which is the greatest offense of all) after thaffeccions, and lusts
of man: What then is there left to season man's folly with all? sith that
both they who ought to have been the seasoners, are them selves corrupted, and
the thing is also tainted, which only was left in the world to bring it at
one time or an other to amendment.

Have ye salt in your selves.
Therefore to thentent you may both ouercum cruel persecucions, and also
contemn all wordly affeccions for the gospels sake: and to thentent also you
may both provide for your own soul health, and bring as many as may be to
salvation, let each of you have in him the falte of the gospel. Let there
be peace, and mutual amity among you. Salt shall make you without
corrupcion: and concord, strong and mighty. Whereas variaunces do raygne,
there is not the salt of the gospel. Where as the vice of ambicion is, there
is neither peace, nor salt. Therefore the philosophers be at contencion and
braule one with an other, because they have not this salt. For this cause also
the phariseis cannot agree with the Saduces, and the Herodia^s, because they
all corrupted with naughty affeccions, lack the salt of the gospel. Your
doctrine shall season the folly of the world, if the people perceive nothing
in your affeccions, that is corrupted and rotten either by desire of glory,
love of money, gredinesse of reuengemente, fear of death, desire of life, or
to be short, by any other worldely affeccion: And if they also perceive that
like as your life, and doctrine shall agree, so in semblable wise you will
agree one with an other. Undoubtedly you shall agree, if you utterly abandonyng
all ambicion (wherewith such persons are attached as desire to rule and play
the lords in this world) do syncerely preach, and teach other, the heavenly
doctrine which you have received of me.

same matter. And he says unto them: whosoever puts away his wife, and
marieth an other breaks wedlock, to her ward. And if a woman forsake her
housband, and be married to an other, she commits aduoutrie.
AFter the Lord Jesus had with such lessons sufficiently prepared the minds of
his disciples against ye storm that was at hand, he departed out of Galile,
and went into that part of Iewry which lies beyond Jordan, whereas John first
taught. Now was Jesus so much renoumed in all places, that he could no where be
hid. Therefore anon as he was cummen, the people came flocking hither in like
manor as they were wo^t to do in other places. Neither was he at any time
weary of doing all men good, of curyng their bodies, of enstructing their
sowles. There lacked not here the phariseis, every where one manor of men,
and like themselfes. The multitude sought for health, and were desirous to
hear his doctrine: but the other desired more to take him in a trip, then to
be healed: to prove him, rather then to learn. And whiles they so did, they
colored their maliciousness with a visure of holiness, and cloked their
disceitfulnesse with a pretensed desire to learn. Oh wisdom unapt to receive
doctrine. They came to Jesus with body, whom they were far from with mind.
They put forth unto him a captious question, saying: What is thine opinion,
our Master? Is it law^ful for a man to put away his wife? etc*
Is is lofull for the husband to forsake his wife? This captiouse question
devised they among themselfes, trusting thend would be, that answering thereunto
he should be driven to grant either one inconvenience, or an other. Before,
he pronounced those blessed, who gelded themselfes for the kingdom of God.
Therefore if he being a favorer of chastity had now given sentence that it had
been leful for a man to cast of his wife because to mary a new, as the Jews
used communely to do: the^ should he have seemed to have taught contrary
doctrines. Again if he had answered that it had been ^^no wise lefull so to
do, then would they have laid against him how he had made the law of none
authority, which gives the husband liberty to put away the wife: The lord
because he would take these crafty fellows in their own craftiness (for they
prepared a snare for him out of the law) asked the^ again: what need you to
ask me this question, since yourselfes do profess ye knowleage of the law?
What commandment has Moses given you touching these matiers? They answered:
Moses suffered the husband, if there were any thing in the wife yt offended
him, by and by after a libel of diuorcemente given up, to put her away, and
mary an other, if it pleased him so to do. The Phariseis did so interpret
this sufferaunce of the law, as though those men did very well, who for every
trifling cause, would be divorced from their wives, and marie again not
understanding the mind of the law maker, which they might have perceived by
the beginning of the book of Genesis. Jesus therefore said unto them: And Jesus
answered and said. etc.
In that Moses gave you this liberty to forsake your wives, he favored not
diuorcement, but suffered the husbands to do, what carnal desire and
sensuality moved them unto, and would rather permit the less yuell, then open
a wyndowe to more greuouse enormities. He would rather suffer unlawful
separacion, then manslaughter, poisoning, or detestable murdering of wives.
For he knew the hardness of your hearts: unto the which vice, this thing was
given as a remeadie, lest greater mischief should have ensued. But in
paradise before the nature of man was fallen to this wickedness, But at the
first creacio^ God made them. etc.
matrimony was not so instituted, yt divorce should be made at the sensual
will and pleasure of the husband: but for ever to continue between man and wife,
and never to be dissolved. For at the first time god joined one to one, that is
to say, man to woman: between whom he would have so great love and charity
to be, that no separacion might chance. For this cause, says he, a man shall
leave his father, and his mother, and stick unto his wife, and they both
shall becum one flesh, so that being now conjoined in body and soul, they
are no longer two persons, but one, to thente^t there may be a mutual
participacion of weal and woe, between them. These words plainly declare that
God was not pleased with divorce, else would he disanull his first ordinance.
But Moses permitting divorce besides the will of God, provided for a season
for ye hardness of your hearts: supposing aduoutry to be a smaller offense
then murdering of wives. If this gentle permission of Moses do please you,
know you also the cause compelling him to give you this liberty. Therefore what
god himself has so conjoined at the beginning, yt it should always continue
undissolved, let not man part asunder. Put away the hardness of your heart,
and then shall there be no need of divorce: then shall separacion of man, and
wife, have no place. With such a sobre, and a discrete answer Jesus defended
gods commandment, and yet neither condemned Moses, nor minished the praise
of chastity, nor finallye brought himself in danger to be taken in the
phariseis snare, but rather snarled the^ with their own grinne, who came
purposely to entrap him. But after he, and his apostles were cumme into the
house, and they being with him alone had asked his opinion herein, then did he
more plainly condemn diuorcement. Whosoever, says he, puts away his wife,
and marieth an other, commits aduoutrye to herward. Again if the wife
forsake the husband, and marye an other, she commits aduoutrie to her former
husbandward. For it is not mete for christen men to be so hard hearted, that
they neither can away with their wives conditions, nor will by fair means
correct them when they do amiss, but for every tryflyng cause conceive
displeasure against them, and ymagine their death, except they depart, and get
them away. This is a Iewishe mind, which my disciples must in no wise have.
The Jew puts away his wife for stenche of breath, for blearnes of the iyes,
or for any such like fautes, whereas among christen men, there is but one cause
only, which dissolueth wedlock, and that is, the breach of the faith, and
promise of matrimony. For that wife which has letten an other manne have the
use of her body, is now no longer a wife, although she be not yet divorced:
and that husband which has letten an other woman have the use of his body,
is now before any separacion be made, no more an husband. As fire is not fire
unless it be hot, so wedlock is not wedlock except that of two be made
one. There cannot be one flesh made of three, or four.

as a child, he shall not enter therein. And when he had taken them up in his
arms, he put his hands upon them, and blessed them. When he had spoken these
words, there were certain persons cum thither, who had brought unto him young
chldren, to thentent he should lay his hands upon them, and bless them. They
saw how diseases were put away by virtue of his touching, and therefore believed
they that the same touching should also be good and wholesome for sucking children
against many such inconveniences as this weak and tender age is wont to be
indaungered with. The disciples supposyng it not to be sitting that their
Lord, for somuche as he was occupied about waightier affairs, should be
weryed with such triflyng matters, kept away the children that they could
not approach him, and further rebuked such as brought them, as though they had
disquieted him with their importunity. Uerilye a little before he praised little
babes unto them. Suffer the children to cum unto me. etc.
Therefore when he perceived how they would not suffer the children to cum unto
him, because it was out of their remembrance what he had said before of such
little ones, he put them unto silence, saying: Suffer ye the children to cum
unto me, and keep them not away from my touching. For unto such belongs the
kingdom of heaven. Those have in them an ensample of innocence and
simplicity, after the patarne whereof, proud malicious persons must be forged
a new, if they desire to be admitted into the kingdom of heaven. Let no man
think that these are to be set naught by, for their weakness or symplicitie.
This one thing I assure you of: Unless a man be borne again, and all
wiliness, covetousness, ambicion, hatred, wrath, desire of reuengement, and
envy, put away, becum such a one in mind, as these are in age, he shall not
be received into the kingdom of heaven. And to thentent he might the more
commend unto all men simple innocence, he took each of them in his arms, and
laid his hands upon them euerychone, and blessed them: teaching hereby how
Bishops ought to disdain the simple unlearned people, nor any other be they
never so bery underlings, or abject persons after the estimacion of the
world, but cherish the^ in every be half til they cum forward to a better
state of perfeccion. And above all things we ought to desire the Lord Jesus,
that he will vouchesafe to lay his holy hands upon such persons, and bless
the^. He will undoubtedly give unto little ones wiliness, whereby they may
escape the devils snares. He will give them a tongue that gods praise may be
made perfect by the mouth of infantes and suckelinges.

Now when these things were done in the house, and he gone forth into the
way, then came there unto him a certain young spryngalte, because that after
childhode was commended, this age should likewise be called from good
beginninges, to things of higher perfeccion. He fell down at his feet, and
said: Good master, what shall I do to purchase me eternal life? The askyng
of this question, smelled sumwhat of that vice, wherewith all such are
attached, as stand in their own conceit.

But gentle teachers are wont to wynke at this fa^te, if it be mean and
tolerable for the great hope an lykelyhode that is in this age to cum
forward. For he desires not so much to be taught of the Lord, what he
ought to do, as to be praised for the things he has already done. And he
calls him good, why call thou me good? etc.
whom he believes to be naught else but a man, as who say, that man had any
good thing of himself. Therefore Jesus, as though he were offended with this
arrogant name, says unto him: why do thou call me good? This name is far
above the state and condition of man. For there is none verily good save god
alone. For this cause, as he is an arroga^t person, whosoever takes this name upon
him: even so he that gives the same unto man, gives him more then it
becummeth him to do. With this proheme Jesus discouraged the young man which in
his own conceit thought himself not much unworthy to have this goodly
title, or name given him: and forthwith asked him this question: know thou
the commandments? Then to him demanding what they were, he answered,
recityng these common commandments following, for keeping whereof the Jews
challenged the praise of goodness and justice. Thou shall not commit aduoutry:
thou shall not kill: thou shall not steal: thou shall not bear false
witness: thou shall not begile thy nighbour: honor thy father and thy mother.
Here this young man hopyng to have been greatly commended, answered again with a
glad and joyful heart: Master I have ever kept all these, since I was a little
child. Jesus beholding his great towardnes (for he cloked not the matter: nor
did not, as the Phariseis, of a naughty mind, or proud stomach stand in his
own conceit) Jesus, I say, signified yt he was delited, even with thonely
endeavor of this age. Therefore he made sembla^t that this godly affeccio^ of
his, albeit it was imperfect, did nevertheless highly please him, who as it were,
embraced ye great li^elihode he espied in him to profit and cum forward in ye
doctrine of ye gospel, (for as that age seldo^ applies Godly living, so ^s ye
study thereof right co^me^dable in ye same) teaching us hereby, how we o^g^^ not
in any wise over sharply to rebuke young folks, in who^ we see any inclination
to theua^gelike and christian godliness: and by that means cause the^ to
withdraw their young and tender minds from the gospel, as sum over wayward
schole masters are wont to do, which by reason of their cruelty and
toughnes, be wont to teach good wits to hate learning: but with all
ientilnes to set them forward, and bring them to better things commending
their diligence, but yet nevertheless showing the^ with all what they must
endeavor themselves to attain unto. The^ Jesus te^pred ye gladness of this yo^g
man, who reioiced ouertimely, saying: That thou have observed these things, I
co^me^d the. But perfect righteousness stands not, as thou supposest, One
thing thou lackest etc.
h^rin. Thou lackest yet one thing. The^ to him merueiling, and as^ing what yt
should be, the lord answered: return home, and make sale of all that ever thou
have* and deal ye money which thou make thereof, among poor folks. Thou
shall not lose such do^es, but for earthly possessions, horde up great treasure
in heaven. And being lighted of thy burden, and fre from all encumbraunces, cum
and follow me. For then will I knowledge the to be a disciple of the gospel.
The young man wanted many things: but Jesus intended to show by touching of
this one soore, how far he was as yet from the perfeccion of the gospel.
After he had heard him say so, he went his way mournyng, because he was
disapointed of the praise of righteousness, which he well hoped he should
have had. For he was a man of great substance, and therefore it seemed unto him
a very soore thing suddenly to forgo the same. Yet departed he not as one
utterly to be despaired of. For he was neither wroth, nor murmured against
Christ, but went his way with mournyng chere and silence. He was commended for
his verteous and godly endeavor: but that he mourns cummeth of man's frailty
and weakness. For he understood not Jesus words, the meaning whereof was not
that a man would so much forsake his goods, as his affeccions. Whosoever is ready
and willing to leave all that he has, if the case so require, has forsaken
all things.

With this ensample, Jesus frayed his disciples from covetousness. Therefore
when the young man was gone away all sad and heavy, Jesus looked round about
on his disciples (for all this was done for their instruccion) and said: he his
gone. How much a do shall it be for them that have aboundaunc^ of money, to
enter into the kingdom of God* These words greatly amassed the disciples, who
supposed that uneath any one could be found, which would suddenly lashe out
great riches for the kingdom of God, although themselfes had forsaken a few
small things of little price or value. Therefore Jesus repeteth the things
which he spoke before, mittigating the sharpnes thereof with pleasant words,
and expouning the dark saying, which they understood not. My children, says
he, how hard is it for the^ that have great substance, and trust unto it, as
the common sort do, to enter into the kingdom of god? And lest this seem to
sore a saying, I will yet speak much sorer words the^ these, but most true
withal: It is easier, I say, for a camel to go through a nedles iye, the^ for a
rich man to enter into gods kingdom. The disciples after they had heard him
say so, were much disquieted in their minds, and reasoned thus among
themselfes: If no man can be saved unless he enter into the kingdom of God,
and if no man can enter into Gods kingdom, except he have forsaken his
riches: then since we see all men so inordinately love the same, that it seems
they will in no ease forgo them: what rich man can there be saved? This
carefulnes of the disciples, smelled of the godly charity of their Lord (for
they were desirous that as many as might possible, should enter into the
kingdom of god) but as yet they understood not the nature and virtue of the
christian profession, which commands us nothing to pass upon wife,
children, parents, no nor life to, if the case so require. It is the easiest
thing that may be, if a man way and pondre the thing self, to contemn and
set naught by richesse: With me^ it is impossible. etc*
and again it is the most grievous thing of all, if we regard the manours of
the people. Therefore the Lord perceiving his disciples to be careful, and
heavy, by reason of the words he spoke unto the^, and at the next door to
desperacion, recomforteth them again. But first he looks upon them as he is
wont to do, so often as he is about to speak any notable thing, or of great
importance. Why despair ye, says he, of the salvation of rich men? The
things which I require, be of much difficulty: but there are much harder
things to be performed. There is nothing harder, then to set naught by life
for ye gospels sake. Herein you shall have me your capitain. If there shall sum
be found, unto whom the gospel shall be more dear then life, will you then
despair, that there shall be sum who will set less by their riches, then by the
gospel* These things seem impossible to human affeccions: But all this is
easily brought about by gods help. God requires hard things, and such as
be far above the strength and power of man: but the same puts to his
helping hand, that man may be able to accomplish his commandments. And so
cummeth it to pass, that man can do that by god almighties help, which of
himself he is in no case able to do. Whosoever with all the heart of his body
trusts him, shall be able to do all things by him. Therefore he that passes
not upon his goods for the kingdom of god, sustaineth no loss thereby, but
has great profit and vauntage. And to know this, is a thing pertainyng, not
to man's wisdom, but to faith given us from heaven. For whosoever he be that
with heart and mind believes that for the goods forsaken, which hindered us
from doing the busynes of salvation, a hundredth fold so much is given us here
in this world, and in the world to cum life everlasting, the same will with
right good will make such an exchange.

Of these words whereby Jesus brought his disciples out of despair, the same
received more courage, and boldness* then they should have done. For now
Peter by co^paryng himself to the young man, who departed away all heavy and
mourning, began to stand much in his own conceit, saying: Lo, we have
forgo^ne all that ever we had for thy sake, and followed the. We have done what
thou while ere requiredst of the young man. To him thou promisedst treasure in
heaven: what reward then ought we to hope after? If a man regard the
valuacion of the Apostles goods, they forsook not much, especially Peter, who
was a fysher man, and with much a do gate his living, with his daily travail
and labor. But unto every man, his owen propre substance is greatest. And he
forgoeth very much, which so forsakes all his goods and riches, that he
has no m^nde, neither to restore, nor to increase the same again. He that
has clean put away all affeccion and gredy desire of riches, the same has
forsaken, not only so much as he was worth, but also so much as he might
have desired. The^ is no man yt has forsaken house or brethren. etc.
The lord after this rule estemyng the goods forsaken of the Apostles (who
with right good will did also forsake such things as were much dearer unto
them, as their parents, their wives, and their kynsfolkes) answered in this
wise: I tell you this for a surety: Not only you shall not be defeated of
your reward, but also there shall be none who for my sake, and the love of the
gospel, has forsaken house brethren, or sisters, or father or mother, or
children, or lands, but he shall receive for every of these things so
forsaken, a hundredth fold so much, and that even in this present life, be
the storms of persecution never so great. For much more shall increase
through the charity of the gospel, then was taken away by the cruelty of
persecutours. For one carnal brother or sister forsaken, he shall have so many
brethren, and systers: as fellows in professing of the gospel. The affeccions
of the spirit be more beheme^te, and pleasanter withal, then are thaffeccio^s
of nature. For one father, and mother, he shall have so many fathers, as
teachers: for one house forsaken, he shall have every where a house, whersoeuer
theuangelike and christen charity shall reign, which doubtless makes al
things common. For a little piece of land forsaken, he shall be partaker of all
the lands which the true professors of the gospel have possession of. And
if these things came not to pass, yet the loss of temporal goods shall be
sufficiently recompensed with the ghostely gifts of the soul, so that a man
had a hundredth times leue^ have the things received, then the things
forsaken. There is no comparison between such things as be transitory, and
will sone perish, although no man take them away, and the riches of the soul,
which no man can give but god alone: no man can take away, but he that gives
them. And if this seem but a small gain, there shall be added thereto the
possession of eternal life in the world to cum. With these sayings the lord
stayed the weak minds of his disciples, lest they should either forthynke
that they had forsaken such things as thy forsook, or else fall again in time
to cum to the love of worldly riches, and going about to be enriched with vile
things, wax miserable poor as touching the goods and riches of the soul.
It is a naughty chance when a man falls again from the love of the goods
of the soul, to the desire of the goods of the body: from true riches, to
vain and deceiuable riches: from everlasting commodities, to fading and
transytory. Now lest that by praysyng of his disciples for forsaking their
goods, and maisterynge their affeccions he should have given them occasion to
be careless, he spoke further a little sentence of like tenor as here ensues:
But many that now seem first, shall once be last. Neither are they to be
despayred of, who be not yet able to perform what the virtue and strength of
christian perfeccion requires: neither ought such to trust themself, as
have profited to a certain degree therein. For there are sum who have done the
like as you have, and yet for all that, they shall fall again to a more
mischievous covetousness. And there be sum, who at this present, cannot
contemn and set naught by their goods (of the which sort that young man was
one) the which in time to cum shall excel such as appeared to have forsaken
all the world. Finally it shall be found that those were poorest of all, who
after the judgment of the world, seemed richest: and contrarily such as
appeared to contemn al worldly things were most gredy and desirous thereof.
For this praise and commendacion stands not in things, but in affeccions. He
is the poorer man of both, who possesses such goods as fortune has lent
him, as though he had them not, ready to depart therewith, so often as his
neighbor is to be helped, not reioycynge over much if any increase be, nor
pynyng away for sorrow, if any thing be taken from him: then he that sets
great store by that little he has, and never makes an end to augment and
increase the same. Hereby he seemed to mean Judas, who albeit that he forsook
all that ever he had, as the other did, and followed Jesus, yet afterward was
he perceived to be a more naughty covetous wretch, the^ those, which after
the judgment of the world be rychest.

And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem.
With such words Jesus framed the minds of his disciples, by little and little
against the most grievous storm of all that was at hand, the mention whereof
they utterly abhorred. For now began he to go up to Jerusalem the which name
the disciples hated, because they had heard say, how their master should
there suffer much shame, and vilanie. In other places of the gospel it is
often times mentioned, how they went before, as when being hungry they plucked
the ears of corn. In this vyage they could not so do. For it is a painful
journey to go up to Jerusalem. It is for them that be of valiant courage, and
strong in spirit, and such in whom this world has naught that is his.
Therefore Jesus now goes before, and the disciples follow after all heavy, and
murmuring against him, because he would willingly put himself in manifest
danger of life. They both maruayled what mind he had so to do, and also
feared their own parts, lest he would bring them into like danger. Such
disciples, so gross, and weak withal suffered Jesus: and does it grieve us
since we be weak our selfs, to bear with the dullness of the weak? They
gaped after a kingdom, they desired to be partakers of glory, and reasoned who
should have the chife place or preeminence: but they utterly abhorred that
thing which was most necessary for their salvation.

Jesus therefore to give us an ensample how we ought in instructing of our
neighbor, to teach him rather necessary things then delectable, rather
wholesome things, then pleasant: After he had called unto him the.xii. whom his
will was should not only be witnesses* but also in some points partakers with
him of this storm: Jesus, I say, printed in their minds what he had first
covertly, and anon after plainly foreshewed unto them, saying: Lo, the time is
now cum, that I have so often told you of: We go up to Jerusalem, to thentent
you may perceive that I willingly, Behold we etc.
and wittinglye, will suffer what tourmentes, and passion soever I shall be put
unto. For I must not fly, sith the time appointed of god is present: this
sacrifice shall be made at Jerusalem, because that place is appointed thereunto.
And the son of man shall be delivered into the hands of the chief priests,
Scribes, Phariseis, and elders of the people. They shall condemn him as a
felon, and a wicked person, and at the le^gthe, after they have accused him of
diverse crimes, judge him to death. And then incontinent shall they deliver
him as a notorious misdoer, to the heathen people, that they may mock him, and
spitte upon him. To be short, he shall be scourged, and slain: but on the
third day he shall arise again from death to life. It is needful for you to
know, and remember these things, specially for twoe causes: partly lest ye
think that the same being altogether wrought according to Gods determinacion,
be done by hasard of fortune, unknowing to me, or against my will: partly
lest this storm when it is cumme, trouble you out of measure, as men that
thought nothing thereon. For it is not mete you should take it grievously, that
I will willingly suffer for your cause, according as my father has determined
I shall do: neither is it convenient that you should be dismayed, as at a
thing which has chanced unlooked for, since I have so often times warned you
hereof before.

Now when the Apostles were all in their dumpes, and like men amassed by reason
of these words, and durst not now counsayll him to the contrary: two of them,
that it is to wete, John, and James the sons of zebede, came unto him alone.
These.ii. after they heard him speak of his resurreccion, conceived good hope,
They sa^^^ unto him. etc.
that that same kingdom which he had so often times promised to cumme, should
very shortly begin. For as yet they had not clean cast out of their minds the
desire of worldly aduaunceme^t. For they set their mother a work, and by her
desired him to have sum preemine^ce and sovereign dignity given the^ in
the same kingdom: but or ever, they uttered their mind, they did what they
could to get a faithful promise of him before hand to have their request
granted, because it should not the^ be lawful for him to deny it them. The
Lord making as though he would deny the^ nothing whatsoever they demanded,
bad the^ tell on hardely what great thing it was that they sued for. For it
seemed that they would desire some weyghty thing, or high promocio^. Lord, say
they, our peticion and suite is, to have this honorable preferment in thy
kingdom, that we may sit next the, the one of us on thy ryghthand, and the
other on thy left. Jesus by askyng them a question, plainly bewrayed their
ignorance and rudenes. For as yet they dreamed upon a certain corporal
kingdom: as yet their minds were upon the primacy. Howbeit it was then no
time to rebuke the^ for their gross ymaginacion: but yet brings he the^
again to the remembrance of death, the which they so much abhorred.
Because, says he, ye perceive not what manner a thing the kingdom of God is,
therefore ye wo^te not what ye desire. You seek after vaynglory, and consydre
not by what means the true glory of my kingdom is attained. I will open you
the way, and if the same do like you, then trust ye verily to have the glory
that you desire, save alonely that it shall be a true glory, and not such a
one as you dream upon, and imagine it to be. Can you drink of the cup I now
make my self ready to drink of?

Can ye be baptized with the baptism that I shall ere it be long be baptized
withal? Ca^ ye dri^ke of ye cup* etc.
They of a gredy desire to have their peticion granted, as they folyshly
desired this preeminence, even so did they rashly promise for their behalf,
and say they could: notwithstanding as yet they knew not themselves ^righte.
Neither did the most gracious Lord rebuke the^ for this their great folly,
forasmuch as the time was not yet cum, that they should be receiuable of these
mysteries. As yet whatsoever they heard, they heard it as it were in a dream:
and yet did he with nevertheless diligence teach, and instruct them, ever
attempering his words to their weakness, because they being afterward, as
a man would say, wakened out of their sleep, and manifestly perceiving the
truth by the holy ghost, should with more entire affeccion love their Lord,
who being such a one as he was, would so iently bear with such manner of
disciples: and also because they being once grown to more perfeccion, should
again follow his ientlenes in bearyng with the weakness of their even
christen, whom they should happen to instruct, having always in their
remembrance, how ignorant, how forgetful, and how dull they also themselves
sometime were. This was an ambicious saying: Let us sit next the in thy
kingdom. It was unadvisedly spoken when they said: we can do it. For it was
spoken of the^, who would soon after deny their Lord and master for fear.
But such error as springs not of malice or obstinate euylues, but of
symplicitie, must either be rured, or else borne withal for a season. Therefore
Jesus answered: Truly ye shall drink of my cup, and shall be baptized with
the baptism that I am baptized with: but in time to cum. For as yet ye are not
able to do the thing, which ye believe ye can do. Therefore prepare your minds
hereunto: but leave all ye judgment of your reward to god the father. Let
your only endeuoyr be to counterfaite me, and follow my trace. He has for every
man his peculier rewards already prepared, and will distribute the same as it
shall please him. For this matter is not so ordered in the kingdom of heaven, as
it is in princes courts, whereas he is not always chief in dignity, which
deserves so to be: but he whom the prince or king chiefly favors. Sumtimes
he favors the naughtyest person of all. But with my father there is no
regard of person. Neither is it your part to regard the measure or multitude
of your merits and deseruinges, since you are able to do nothing of your
selves: nor to considre how far ye pass other. You must only do your endeuoyr
according to the power that God has given you, to follow me. Ye shall not be
defeated of your reward, although you think not thereon at all. For he that
fights for the rewards sake, and would not else fight unless he thought he
should be rewarded for his labor, clean disapointeth himself of the reward.
Let no man be his own judge, but do what he can: and then remitte the whole
judgment unto god.

And lo, how one evil sprang of another. The simplicity of these two
disciples, bewrayed a greater rudenes and ignorance of the rest. For after it
was cum to the others knowledge what the two brethren, although their request
was not granted them, had desired of the Lord, they all in manner disdayning
hereat, were angry with them and in their top, because not regarding their
simplenes and mean estate, they presumed to desire ye first or chief place
which was rather due unto them. There was none of them all but hoped he should
have had that preferment himself, according as each of them favored his own
gifts, and deserts. Doubtless these are the very affeccio^s of such persons,
as lead their lives in princes courts. Every man there highly estemeth
himself: every man warraunteth himself the most honorable aduauncementes,
and has great heart burning and disdain at others preferment save that the
ambici^n of courtiers is spiced with malice, where as the disciples ambicion
was nothing else but mere ignorance and symplicitie. And whiles they straue thus
for the preeminence and primacy, they had clean forgotten the words that
Jesus had spoken of the least, and greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and of
the imitacion and following of the little one. If any man ask the question why
the Lord suffered so great ignorance so long while to continue in his
disciples, by whose ministerye he purposed to have the doctrine of the gospel
preached, and taught throughout all the whole world: truly, the chief cause
was, because he would by little and little clean weed out of their minds, this
and such other naughty affeccions, and therefore does he suffer them so often to
fall again into the same affeccion, that is to say, into ambicion or desire of
dominion and preferme^t: even as if a man be soon delivered of an ague he
soon forgets both his disease and also the benefit of the physician, that
cured him: Again if he often times recidiuyng, and falling into the same
disease again, be at the length with much a do rid and healed thereof, the^
does he the more hate his disease, and also the more knowledge the benefit of
his healing, and shall better know how to cure other that are likewise
diseased. But Jesus when he had called them etc.
Therefore Jesus perceiving that the fond peticion of ye two, and the
disdaynfull wrath of the other, issued both out of one well, called them all
unto him, because he would ministre physic unto them all with one medicine.
As often, says he, as ye hear me speak of the kingdom of heaven (which
verily is a spiritual kingdom and differs no less from this worldly
kingdom, then the yerthe differs from heaven) do not you by vain and
fantastical ymaginacion, feign such a likeness and an apparaunce of things,
as you see here in yearthlye kingdoms. For ye know that those which seem to
be ^hiefe rulers among the heathen people of his world, play the lords over
such as be under their obeysaunce, and subieccion. And they which are great
men among the heathen do exercise their power and authority over them, that
they have rule and governance of. Beware there be no such thing among you.
Here a desire to help the neighbor, makes a man greater, and not ye desire
of worldly preferme^t. Therefore as I have also taught you before time, whosoever
desires to be great in very deed among you, let ye same be your minister: let
him, I say, not exalte himself to bear rule, but humble himself to do all
men good. For the son of man also came not. etc.
And whosoever will be chief among you, let the same be the servant of all
the rest: let him not challenge any soueraignitie or preeminence, but serve to
the end he may do all men good: not sekyng hereby his own honor, but referring
all the whole praise and glory unto God, whom he serves in his me^bres. Let it
not grieve you to counterfaite the ensample which you see plainly expressed in
me. For the son of man came into the world, not to rule, nor to lay the yoke
of bondage upon other men's necks, but to be a minister for every man's
salvation: and not only to serve for all men's wealth and commodity, but also
to give and bestow himself for the enfranchisyng of bo^dmen, to this end,
that by the death and loss of one, a great many should be saved. Of a truth
this is the very Euangelyke and chrystian soueraigntye, which whosoever will
desire, let him desire it as I do, and look for a reward, not such a one as
he appoynteth unto himself, but such as it shall please the father to give
him: like as I without condition obey my fathers commandments even to the
cross, wholly referryng the reward of mine obedience unto his will, and godly
arbitrament. It shall be a great shame for you to desire dignity as you see
worldly princes do, and to seek for a reward of the father of heaven. Either
desire you the kingdom of heaven, and look after an heavenly reward: or else
if you desire this worldly kingdom, then require ye not the reward of the
kingdom of heaven.

With such lessons and monicions they were before hand instructed and taught,
who went with Christ to Jerusalem. For the cleuer that every man is from all
affeccions, the better appointed is he to go to ye battle of the cross.

Now were they cum to the City of Hierico which is not far from Jerusalem.
Hierico in the Syrian tongue signifies the Moon. By the Moon is figured this
present life, which is nothing else but the common course of the world, where
some be borne and some dye: some be sick and some be whole: some grow toward
man's state, and some draw in age: sometimes chances glad things, and
sometimes heavy. For our cause Jesus came down from that heavenly
tranquillity, yet will he not tarry here, but hastes to Jerusalem, being very
desirous of man's salvation. And hitherto his disciples, and with them a great
multitude of people, followed him. Mark well how Jesus is every where as he is
called. Either he teaches, or heals, or else restores to life again. What
his death should cause through the belief of the gospel that was preached,
he showed now plainly by a corporal figure. Mankind was blind through
ignorance of the truth, and poor and beggarly for lack of all virtues.
Unless Jesus had passed by us, there had been no hope of light.

For a certain blind beggar well known of the people, called Bartymeus, the
son of one Timeus, Blind Bartymeus the son of Tymeus.
sat by the high ways side, who when he perceived him to cum, began to cry,
and say: Jesus the son of David have mercy upon me. First the brute, or
preaching of the Gospel, shows us that Jesus passes by: then the great
confidence which we straightwaies conceive of him, will not suffer us to hold
our peace when he goes by. For the sinner knowledging and confessyng his
wretched living, cries upon the merciful savior, and desires him to take
mercy and compassion upon him. He is at the next door to light, whosoever
knowleageth his own great blyndnes. To say, Lord have mercy upon me, is not
a saying of the Phariseis, who thought themselves to be men of a perfect sight,
but an eua^gelike and a christian saying. Neither use the Phariseis to say: O
thou son of David. For they say: is not this the carpenters son? That blind
man saw a greatdeale more in the dark, then the Jews do at this present day,
which boast and brag upon the knowledge of the law, and profess themselves
to be guydes of the blind. But the multitude of people is an impediment and
hynderaunce to the sely wretch, thus crying and calling for mercy. For what
other thing can they do but disturb and trouble? His conscience also cries
out against him, not with one voice, but with as many as are the offenses that
he knows himself guilty of, saying: what have thou to do with Jesus, which
art defiled with so many sins? The law cries and barketh against him
saying: thou cryest in vain: God is just: look after punishment for thine
offenses. The rulers of the Synagoge cry out against him, commaundyng that no
man preach, no nor be so hardy as once to name this name Jesus, saying: there
is no health and salvation in Jesus, but in Moses. To be short, the same
thing do the Philosophers and heathen princes. But that a man may know a very
euangelike and christen faith in this blind man, he gave not over when the
people thus cried against him, insomuche that being rebuked, and commanded to
hold his peace, he cried louder then he did before, saying: Thou son of
David have mercy upon me. The people were offended with his crying: Jesus alone
was nothing offended herewith, but stood still, and commanded him to be called
unto him. He heard him cry as he, passed by: but he made as though he had not
heard him. This came not of any daungerousnes on Jesus behalf: but was the
act of him, who went about to wring out of the man a notable faith, for the
ensample of other: and his pleasure was to teach all men by this blind man,
how and by what means light may be extorted or gotten perforce of Jesus. The
first hope to obtain light, is to have Jesus to stand still at our crying: The
second, to be called unto him, either by the teachers of the gospel, or else
by the secret inspiracions of the holy ghost. For the blind man could not go
unto him, unless he had been led and guided by holy scripture, which we ought
in no wise to despise, although it be ministered by man. The Apostles, and
preachers of the gospel, do happily call a blind man, when they call him at
the commandment of Jesus. But now adays they call without his commandment,
not unto him, but to the aids of human Philosophy, or Heathen learning, to
thobseruacion of Moises law, and to ye commodities and pleasures of this
present life. Assuredly these ^allers make the blind, more blind then he was
before. But the Apostles obeyng their masters commandment, And they called
the blind, saying.
called this man unto Jesus, and so true is it, yt they did not cry, and
brable against him, as the people did, that they put him (having good hope
already) in more hope and comfort, saying: Be of good chere, arise, Jesus
calls thee. The blind man conceived so great hope herewith, that he cast
away his cloak which defended him against the cold weather, and skypped out
of the place where he sat, and ran to Jesus. Here will I stay the a little
while, good reader, because thou may mark the great readiness of mind,
And threw away his cloak.
and fervent courage of this blind beggar. How often art thou called unto
Jesus? and do neither cast away thy cloak or ma^tell, nor skyp out of thy
de^ne of misery, nor run unto him ye calls thee, but tournest thy back, but
lingrest from day to day, but castest doubts, but ^^dest cauillacions and
feigned excuses, but waxest luskyshe in thy fylthe, and darkness, and had
rather ask an alms of ye world in a foul beggarly cloak then receive light
of Jesus, wherein is contained the sum of all felicity? What a goodly and
fair vesture is the garment of innocence, and clean life? What a foul
mantell has he yt is clothed with lechery, with covetousness, with excess
and ambicio^? How vile and wretched a beggar is he, who for a small and
corporal commodity croucheth and kneleth unto this world? How miserablye
blind is he, that neither knows himself, nor almightye God his maker? As
often as thou art called from this miserable wretchedness unto Jesus, either
when thou read the gospel, or hear the same preached, or else when thou
art drawn by a certain secret inspiracion of the holy ghost, why doeste
thou not then (all things laid aparte, that are wont to let and hinder a man
to attain so great felicity) leap up unto the hope of a better life? Why
runnest thou not with most sure faith unto Jesus, which only is able to
give the light, and will give it to all men? Jesus comes unto the: he calls
the: and do thou again for thy part grutche to mete him? Thou pynest and
wyddrest away even till thy dying day in thy darkness: but thou shall not
ever have Jesus passing by the. Certes after death he calls no man to
salvation, but to judgment. When he passes by here in this world, he hears
him that cries, have mercy upon me: here he stands still, here he calls,
here he gives light. This beggar has made the ashamed of thy slothfulness,
unto whom the Lord, when he was cu^men unto him said. What ayleth the to cry?
what will thou have me to do unto the? what* knew not Jesus why he cried? knew
not he what he should do? That is not so: but all this was done for our
custruccion. Many believed that this blind man looked for an alms of the lord,
because he was a beggar. For so now a days many cry unto Jesus: Lord have
mercy upon me. And being demanded what they sue for, what they desire to have,
one says, grant that I may be rich: an other, that I may get an office:
this man, that I may have a wife with a good dowry: an other give me bodilye
strength: give me long life: or grant that I may be avenged on my enemy. The
blind said unto him. etc.
But these things Jesus many times takes away from his friends, because it
so behooves for their salvation. The euangelike beggar desired none of all
these things. For he knew right well what ought to be desired of Jesus.
Therefore let us both hear and follow him: Rabbone says he, (that is as much
to say, as my master) make me to see. For being careless for all other
things, he desired nothing else but light, whereby he might see God and his
son Jesus, whom to know is everlasting life. For in scripture to know God,
is nothing else but to see God. O very Euangelike and christian prayer, How few
words has it? but how great faith? Doubtless this is that short prayer which
pearceth the heavens. Therefore, Jesus answered: Go thy way, thy faith has
purchased the health. He is not byanby a man undone, and cast away, which
sees not awhit with bodelyiyes: but whosoever sees nothing at all with the iyes
of his soul, the same cannot, be saved. To have recovered these iyes, is life
everlasting. Hear this saying thou pharisaicall fellow whosoever thou be, that
say: I ascribe my safety to mine often fastinges, to my long prayers, to mine
almesdedes and my sacrifices: and for that cause thou criest not with the
beggar, have mercy on me: but say, give me the reward due unto my
deseruinges. Now Jesus does contrarily ascribe salvation unto faith, and not
unto works.

The blind man straight ways recovered his sight, not because he deserved
it, but for that he believed. And being commanded to go his way, he followed
Jesus. Light is given the freely: thy blindness is taken away for naught.
Afterward thou art left to thine own arbitrament whether thou will use the
gift of god aright or no. Thou art not compelled to follow: thou have only
power given the to see Jesus: go now whither thou will, but at thine own
adventure. What did that blessed blind man? Heretourned not back again to his
beggarly cloak, or mantel: he returned not to his old beggerye, but forgote
all these things, and followed Jesus in the way. It avails but little to have
known Jesus, unless thou do thy deuoire to follow him whom thou see. Jesus
goes straight to the cross, hither must thou follow him, after thou have once
recovered thy sight a gain. As long as thou art blind, thou may cry: Jesus
have mercy upon me: but thou can not follow him this way, before thine iye
sight be restored. For who would follow him that willingly gives his soul to
death, unless he saw by faith, that worldly reproach were the way to
everlasting glory: that bodily tourmentes, and affliccions, were the way to
everlasting joys: that death were the way to life eternal. These things the
quick syghted of this world, see not perfitely, who do not only with all
their iyen look after rule, riches, honors, pleasures, and long life: but
also endeuoyre themselves to get the same by unlawful means, as by counsayling
before with Astronomiers, Soothsayers, Inchaunters, or Necromanciers. These
things, I say, they only see which believe the doctrine of the gospel, and
have sure trust that they shall receive and enjoy the reward promised in
the same.

The.xi. Chapter.

THat thing was not yet wrought in the minds of the disciples, which Jesus
expressed and set out by a figure, in ye blind man. They yet saw not perfitly
with their inward iyes, how happy is the death of those yt follow Christ's
death. They yet dreamed upon this worldly kingdom. The lord therefore, because
he would the better faste^ this in their minds, how such as will follow him,
ought in no wise to desire the kingdom of this world, showed them a spectacle,
whereby he derided and laughed to shorn all worldly pomp and glory, as a
thing that lasts but for a season, and soon shall perish: yet by the same he
plainly declared, that he could have commanded whomsoever he would, to do
what it had pleased him, save that his will and pleasure was rather to obey the
will of the heavenly father. Finally he would have all men to know how he
was the selfsame person, whom the Jews awayted for to cumme so many hundred
years before, (according to the prophecies and foresayinges of the Prophets)
for the salvation of the whole world. When therefore he approached, and was nigh
unto Jerusalem (for he was by Bethphage, and Bethany, which are two little
towns in the mountain called mount Oliuete, from whence a man might have
seen Jerusalem) he sent out from thence two of his disciples, giving them in
commandment to do as follows: Go ye, says he, into that town which you
see yondre directly against you, and by and by as ye be entered in, you shall
find an Asses foale tied at the gate, Go your way into the town. etc.
the which is not yet broken: and whereupon no man has ridden unto this day:
leuse it, and bring it hither unto me. And if any man ask you the question why
you untie it, say again: the lord has need of this, and straight ways he
shall send it hither to me. The disciples went their way as they were bidden,
and so came, and found an Asses foale tied before the gate, in a place whereas
two ways met, and leused it. In the mean while some of those that stood by,
when they saw strange meant untie the foale, said unto them: Syrs what mean
you? Why untie you the foale? The disciples made no other answer, then the
lord commanded them to make, saying: the Lord has need hereof. The other
notwithstanding it was unknown unto them whom they called their Lord, did yet
let the foale go without any further questioning, or reasoning the matter
with them. The disciples after they had untied it, brought it unto Jesus. Here
I would have the earnestly monished, good reader, that not only the words
which Jesus Christ spoke, but also whatsoever he did all his life long, was
not done at all auentures, but by the counsel and wisdom of god, for man's
erudicion. For there is nothing that has not in it, And they brought the
Coalte to Jesus.
either an ensample set out to thentent to move and stir us to virtue, and
godly living, or a representacion of the old prophecies, or a fulfilling of
the fygures, wherewith the law did as it had been, with certain dark
mysteries or riddles, sygnifie Christ: or else a sygnificacion of things that
afterward should happen and cum to pass. And whereas the mystical sense of
every thing is diligently to be searched out, yet the more he approached unto
the time of his death, when the business of our salvation should chiefly be
wrought, the more holyer mysteries were all things full of. For now was that
time at hand, the which he greatly thirstyng, and desyring all men's
salvation, spoke of before, saying: when I shall be lifted up from the earth, I
will draw all things unto me. For there was not room enough in Iewry for his
charity: And there the fruit of the gospel did not counteruayle the labor,
and diligence of the tiller. For this cause Christ sent for the wild, and
unbroken asses foale, whereupon no man had sytten before. This foale signifies
the Gentiles, who neither obeyed the law of nature, nor were under Moses
laws. For upon the Asses, that is to say, the Synagoges back, both Moses,
and the prophets had ridden. Certain of the new disciples are now sent out
to call the Gentiles, who call them not to Moses, but to Jesus. Here would
there not lack some which would brable and speak against them, and say:
What do you? why untie you the foale? For this foale had both many, and also
uncertain Masters, and was tied, and stood where two ways met. Whosoever is not
obedient unto gods commandments, has as many masters, as he has vices
that he serves and is subdued unto: and is so tied, that he has no house, but
stands in sight where two ways mete, ready for every manne that will take
him. But when Jesus calls, no man has power to resist. The Jews cried, and
said: This salvation is ours by promise. Why then are the Heathen Idolatours
joined with us? Unto them answer was made: he that is the Lord of all, has
need of such foales. He is now weary with laboring in vain among the Jews,
and desires to rest him upon the unbroken foale. That this foale is unbroken,
does not displease him, so there lack not obedience of faith. A new ryder
has need of a new beast to ride upon.

The disciples, who as yet wot not what the matter means, do nevertheless
with their diligent ministry, And cast their garments on him.
help forth and further the matier. They cover the foale with their mantels,
because he should not ride upon his bare back. O* whosoever thou be that art a
preacher, and teacher of the gospel, follow this diligence of ye disciples.
Whersoeuer thou shall see an unbroken Asses foale tied where two ways mete,
ignorant of the law of the gospel, and subject to many vices, but for folly,
and simplicity, rather then of any malice or obstinate euelnesse: and such a
one as will obey if a man lead it away, look thou untie it and bring it unto
Jesus. Cast upon it the mantell of wholesome doctrine: and then Jesus the Lord
of all, will vouchesafe to ride upon his back. Follow thou also the diligence
of the other, who against that Christ should ride forth covered the way with
their garments, that is, with ensample of the ua^gelike and Christian
godliness. Many there were also which decked the way with boughs, cut down
from trees, especially from the Palm trees which bear the figure of virgins,
and Martyrs. Jesus the Lord of all thought it a royal thing to ride through
such a way upon such a beast.

Now stay a little while, good reader, and compare me with this spectacle, or
sight, one of those that were chief among the Jewish priests: and first of
all regard what manor of personage is he, and how great, which rydeth upon
the Asses foale. It is the son of God, unto whom the father has given all
power in heaven, and in earth. It is the savior and governor of the whole
world. It is the author, Lord, and king, of all things that are created and
made: a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech, who with a beck was
able to do whatsoever he would: whose majesty all the orders of Angels do
adore and worship: who sits on the right hand of the father almighty. ^ith
his dignity compare me a bishop of one temple, which has bought ye
priesthode or prelacie lasting but for one year, of a wicked and Heathen king,
for a filthy sum of money. Compare the bare head of Jesus, with his tyare or
myter, all glysteryng and shining with gold, and precious stones. Compare that
sobre, and mylde countenance of Jesus, with his face puffed up with pride: with
his grym forheade, with his frowning brows, with his stately look, with his
contencious or uncharitable mouth. Compare the bare hands of Jesus, with his
fyngers laden with ringes, and precious stones. Compare the course, and homly
garment of Jesus with his tragical or masking apparayle, who wears nothing
courser the^ clothe of gold, or purple sylke. Compare the disciples mantels,
with his golden sadles, with his covering clothes of cry masyne sylke, The
Bishop of Romes pomp is covertly described.
with his silver styropes, but over gylte. Compare this commune Asses foale
that carried Jesus, with so many Mules trapped with sylke, and clothe of gold,
with so many royal coursers and great horses, with so many Palfrayes of great
price, with so many wagons, with so many chariottes, with so many chaires of
estate prepared to carry one man. Compare me the few, and poor simple
disciples of Jesus, with ye solemn pomp, passing the pomp of any worldly
prince, of such as go before the Bishop, of his hensemen, of Trumpettes of
sundryetune, of such as enuiron and guard his personage, of the bend of
horsemen, and footemenne: among whom as every of them is most proud, hye
minded and statelye, so is the same next the bishops own proper person,
and in greatest favor and conceipte with him. Compare the joyful cryinges of
the children that went before, and followed Jesus, who inspired with the holy
ghost, song this saying taken out of the prophecy of David: Hosanna, that is
so say, make us safe. Blessed is he that cummeth in the name of the Lord:
Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cummeth. Hosanna in the
highest. Compare, I say, these joyful cryinges with the vnghostlye
acclamacions, wherewith the multitude of flatterers cry upon and ungracious
Iewishe bishop, saying: God send the most holy father in God, long life. God
grant his hygheste priest the victory. I pray god that the most blessed and
chief prelate of religion may reign in prosperity. How much Jesus defieth
such bishops, this one thing plainly declares, because he commanded all that
colored and stately priesthode, with the temple thereof, utterly to be
abolished and destroyed. For these be they by whom even now in our days,
Jesus (who will be the only head of priesthode) is slain in his me^bres. He
seeks for those ministers that may bring unto him the Ass, that may cover
the foale with their ma^tels, that may strowe the way with Palm boughs, and
with godly acclamacions and cryinges, knowleage that the kingdom of the
gospel promised of the prophets is come and present. Neither gives he any
ear to the Phariseis muttring against him, and not contented with these
joyful cryinges of the people: but says that the very stones shall sooner cry
out, then gods glory be conceled.

With such a pomp the king Jesus entered into the royal city of Jerusalem:
the heavenly priest entered into the temple, and there as it was beseming for a
king, and priest, taught the people, healed the sick, made strong the weak
and feeble, as one usurping violent rule in another man's kingdom. In the
mean while the wicked priests, Phariseis, and headmen of the people freated
at the mattier, but the simple people easy to be enstructed cried joyfully
upon him.

Jesus as though he would have restored the decayed religion of the temple,
which the phariseis thought that time chiefly to flourishe, beheld every
part thereof, diligently bewyng and marking if any thing were done therein, not
besemyng the house of god: not because he passed so much what were done in
that temple, which he knew very well should within short space after be
destroyed: but his pleasure was to declare by a certain corporal figure what
manner a church he would have his to be, which he builded of lively stones.
Among these stones it is mete that the christian bishop be conuersaunt and
walk, having always a diligent iye, and seeing that there be nothing among
them, which may defyle the temple dedicated unto god. The things that defile
it are ambicion, filthle gain, covetousness, and falsehode. These
abhominacions the Lord Jesus does not suffer in his temple. And now the
eue^tyde was cum.


Now when the evening drew nighe, he returned into Bethanie, because that in
so rich, and royal a city, he could find no place to be harbored in. O
flower of religion, which cannot away with the chief prelate of all
religion. Oh misnamed Jerusalem, which blinded with worldely lusts, knows
not her pacifier. O happy Bethany which without the works of the law,
through the only obedience of faith, deserved to have Jesus to be her geast.
When on the next day in the morning earlye, he returned from Bethany to
Jerusalem, as he trauayled by the way, he began to wax hungrye, who in
very deed hungered man's salvation: and the swetest bread unto him that could
be was to redeem mankind, according unto the fathers will and determinacion,
albeit he was also, touching the nature of man which he had taken upon him,
verily pangued with bodily hunger, and felt the grief thereof as other men
do, by reason of the dries of his body.

Therefore when he saw a far of a fig tree, which because it was full of
grene leaves, appeared to have had some fruit: he ran thereu^to to se
whether it had any thing to assuage his hunger withal. It is a sore pain when
a man is very hungrye, and has nothing to eat. But it is a much greater
grief for one to see those miscarye through their unbelief, whom he is very
desirous to save. And when he came unto the fig tree, and deceived with the
allurement of the leaves, found no fruit thereon, he cursed it, saying: Never
man eat fruit of the hereafter while the world endures.

The disciples secretly meruailed between themselves why he thus cursed the
tree, especially sith the time was not yet cum, when this kind of tree is
wont to have fruit. Corporal honger has her proper anger: But theuangelyke
and spiritual honger, has a more sharp and bytyng testiness. Christ thought
every tarying over long whereby man's salvation was prolonged. And trees have
due times appointed them of nature, when to bring forth their fruit, so that
he may appear unreasonable to pray that it might be evermore baraine,
because it brought not furthe fruit before due season. Furthermore, for what
purpose ran Jesus to the fig tree to shake down the fruit if there had
been any, sithe he knew right well there was none? But this art which in
outward apparaunce seemed fond, and unreasonable, occasyoned the disciples not
only to be more attent and take better head, but also to ensearche the mystery
thereof. The Lord Jesus most hungry and desirous of man's salvation, found
fruit in the barrayne trees, where there was no hope of fruit, that is to
say, in common women, in Publicans, in sinners, in heathen folks, in the
womanne of Canaan, and in the Samaritanes. Only in the priests, Scribes, and
Phariseis, of whom all men had conceived greatest hope that in them should
be the sweatest fruit of the Gospel, found he none at all. They kept the
fortress of religion: they were continually in the temples: they had knowleage
of the law, and prophets: they looked pa^e with fastinges: they used long
prayers: they gave great alms: and besides this, their robes and broad
Philacteries made a wonderful show, as though they had been altogether given
to the study of virtuous and godly living. Truly these were the leaves which
promised the world tymely ripe fruit, even before due season. But the Lords
intent was to show that there is nothing farther paste all grace, and goodness,
then is ungodliness colored with a counterfaite show, or visure of holiness.

This fygge tree deserves to be cursed of Jesus, lest any manne deceived with
the goodly show of her leaves, would from hence forth hope to have of this
sort of people, any sweat fruit of theuangelyke, and Christian charity.

And Jesus went into the temple etc.
Therefore he departed from the fygge tree which deserved no ill, and came to
Jerusalem, wherein was the moral fig tree that had been so long time
nourished, and dunged in vain, and yet brought forth nothing else but leaves.
And when he was entered into the temple, he showed again another figure,
whereby to declare what purity besemeth the church of the gospel, and also
what cleanesse be cummeth an heart dedicated unto the spirit of Christ. For
with a scourge or whippe of cords, And he taught the^ salyng, etc.
he drove, and whipped out of the temple, the rablement of biers, and sellers,
and also ouerthrewe the tables of the money chaungers, and the stools of the
dove sellers, and suffered none to carry any profane or unclean vessel
through the temple. And lest he should have seemed to have been angry with them
causeless, he alleged the testimony of the prophet Esaye: Is it not, says
he, written? My house shall be called a house of prayer unto all nations, but
ye have made it a den of theaues, deceitfully doing the same thing therein
under couloure and pretense of the honor, and service of god that theaues do
to wayfaryng men in their iourneys. The Lord cared not greatly for the purity
of that temple, which his will was should be destroyed with the rites and
ceremonies thereof: but he set forth unto us the notable purity of the new
temple, whereof himself would be the chief workman and builder, covertly
sygnifying with all, how the priests, scribes, and phariseis, should be
worthily deposed from the principality of religion, who had so defiled, even
that ancient, and figurative religion, with their covetousness, falshod,
hypocrisy, and all kinds of filthynesse. We never read that ever Jesus was
so moved: never that he used like cruelty. What would he now do if he saw
his spousesse the church (which he washed with his own precious blood, to
make her clean unto himself, without any spot, or wrynckle) so to be arrayed,
polluted, and defiled with all manor of fylthynesse, and that by the very
bishops the rulers of the same? Who have not only catell, and pigyons to sell,
but also all holy things, which in very deed, can neither be bought, nor sold
for money. He sees it undoubtedly although he wink the rat for a season.
Neither shall such persons therefore escape unpunished, because god of his
great lenity and gentleness suffers them, to thend they should repent, and
cu^ to amendme^t. The day, the day shall cum, when that terrible scourge shall
be made, to whippe all those into the fire of hell that be defilers of the holy
temple.

And that it may appear what a great mischief the covetousness of priests
and phariseis is: when the chief of the priests and scribes, who had the
greatest porcio^ of the gaynes, saw these things, they sought a mean how they
might destroy Jesus. Oh fig tree barayne, and cursed in deed. They boast and
aduaunt themselves for the chief prelates of p^re religion, and yet, in the
name of God, be they sore displeased, that the defilers of the temple are
driven out a doors. There lacked not in them a wicked mind ready to commit
heinous murdre: but they sought occasion how they might safely accomplish
their desire. They alone could not find in their hearts to love that lovely
and amiable Jesus, For they feared him because all the people, etc*
who hurt no body, but did all men good. They feared him, only because the
people meruayled at his doctrine, and conceived an high opinion of him for the
miracles they had seen him work before. Oh wrong shapen holiness in them that
were professors of holiness. After they had purposed to do so wicked a deed,
they were not afraid lest God (unto whom nothing is unknown) would be
avenged: and yet stood they in dread of the people. Why did they not at the
least wise fear Jesus himself? They had both seen, and heard tell of the
great number of miracles that he wrought, which were an evident testimony that
gods power was presently with him, so often as he would himself. He that i^
able to chase away devils and put them to flighte, can much easlyer put them
in. He that with the bare word of his mouth, rayseth the dead, and calls
them to life again, can with much less difficulty, take away the life. If
they believe he is so gracious and merciful, that though he be able, yet will
he hurt no body: why then go they about to put such a one to death? If they
believe that he will also do, what he is able to do: why do they not, even for
very fear of punishment and vengeance, refrain from so wicked a purpose?
Doubtelesse this was that incurable blinddenesse of them, who thought in their
own conceytes none had iyes, and could have seen but they. Now when the night
eftsoon approached, Jesus, who had been all the day in the temple fasting and
without meat, departed from Jerusalem.

So often forsakes he the city, offended with the obstinate unbelief of the
inhabitauntes: so often cummeth he thither, to find sum fruit, if it would be in
so goodly a show of leaves. But would to god this cursed figtre had been
nothing else but barain, and not brought forth deadly poison. Jesus, the time
of his death and passion being now at hand, suffered no time to pass away
fruitless. He spent all the day in the temple, and bestowed the night in
prayer, and priuatelye animating and encouraging of his disciples. Again when
early in the mourning they returned from Bethany to Jerusalem, and passed by
the fig tree, the disciples perceived how it was withered, even from the very
roots, to the highest top.

Peter called to remembrance what Jesus had done the day before, and knew
right well how he had cursed the tree, and yet meruayling that it was
suddenly withered in all parts from the very roots, said to the lord:
Master: Lo the fig tree that thou cursedst is now withered. Peter meruayled
here at, not withstanding he had often times before seen him do far greater
things than this. Surely he had forgotten this lesson, how there is nothing
so hard, that faith is not able to bring to pass. Of faith springs all the
fruit of the gospel. And because the Sinagoge wanted this faith, we see how
she is clean withered. The church of the Gentiles blossometh and brauncheth
out with many crowns of Martirs, with many precious stones of virgins, with many
ensamples of virtue. On the other side, what is further paste all grace and
goodness, more abject, vile, and barayne, then the Jews are: Where is the
authority of the law becum? where is the merueilous show of religion or
holiness? where is the temple? where are the stately Scribes, and Phariseis?
Is not the fig tree all withered? Therefore, says he, if ye will blossom and
bring forth fruit, put confidence, not in your own strength, but in God.

I assure you of this one thing, if a man having a sure belefe in god,
command this fig tree to wither (which thing you marvel at, now it is
done) not only that shall forth with cum to pass, but also if he say unto
this mountain: Avoid out of thy place, and cast thy self into the sea, albeit
it seem a thing very impossible, yet if he speak the word nothing doubting or
mistrusting in his heart, but have conceived a sure belief of mind, that
whatsoever he say shall in very deed cum to pass, then undoubtedly whatsoever
he commands, shall be done. This belief toward god, shall cause that ye
shall desire nothing of him in vain. Therefore trust ye on my wa^randise, that
whatsoever ye demand of the father not mistrusting but he will grant you
your request, you shall obtain it, so that your minds be fre from desire of
reuengement: and on condition, ye desire but what shall be expedient for your
soul health. He that distrusteth, obtains nothing. For such a one believes
that the father either cannot acomplish his desire (whereas in deed he his able
to do all things with a beck) or at the least wise will not let him have what
he lawfully asks: that man also obtains not his request, and if he believe
his faith is a naughty shamlesse faith, whosoever desires the father to pardon the
trespaces that he has committed against his majesty, whereas he will not
again for his part release unto his christian brother, such offenses as his
said brother had committed against him. Wherefore when ye settle your selves to
prayer, forgive with all your hertes, if any body have ought offended you. For
under this condition shall your father in heaven release you your trespaces: If
you will not forgive your neighbor the fault which he has committed
against you, neither will the father of heaven pardon the offenses, whereby ye
have trespaced his goodness.

These things done on the way, they came again to Jerusalem, and Jesus,
according to his accustomed manoure, went unto the temple. The presence of
Jesus in the temple, is soul health in the church. Neither besemeth it such
as are in Christ's stead, to be any where oftener, then in the temple. They be
in the temple, which entermeddle with those things that pertayne to god, and
not unto this world.

What makes a bishop in a ca^pe among warriers? And as he walked in the
temple. etc,
what has he to do in theaters, yt is to say, in stages, and places ordained
for the people to behold sightes and enterludes in? what makes he in princes
courts? The phariseis, Scribes, priests, and elders were by bodily presence
often in the temple: but as touching ye spirit, they were a great way of.
Therefore when the hye priests joining unto them the Scribes, and headmen of
the people, because the matter should seem to be done by a lawful counsel,
saw how Jesus had all the multitude in the temple, diligently harkening and
listening unto his doctrine, and also how, by reason of his miracles, he
raygned and played the king, as it had been in another princes kingdom (for he
drove ^ut marchantmen, and such as carried vessels through the temple) they
went and interrupted him in his preaching, renewing their old manoure of false
reproving, and saying: by what authority do thou these things? And who
has given the license thus to do? They were not able to disprove his doctrine:
neither could they deny his miracles, being so many, and so evident with all:
nor find fault with them, sith he wrought them all for man's preseruacion,
and that freely. They sought occasion of authority, whereby they might have
some quarrel against him. For they would not in any wise that this glory should
have been given unto God: but all their whole dryft was, to have their own
authority every where highliest esteemed. If Jesus (whom they believed to be
nothing else but a man) had taken upon him gods authority, then would they by
an by have made a matier of blasphemy of it. If not, then had there not been to
seek, a forged matter of sedicion to lay against him, for that by his own
private authority, without leave and license of the priests and elders, he
presumed to do such a thing in the temple. What neded them to move this
question of authority? since his very deeds declared that all that was done,
was done by the might and power of God? sith the thing it self plainlye
showed, how this was he whom God by his Prophets promised long ago to cumme:
sith the father after his baptism, declared with his own voice, that this
was his singularlye beloved son, whom they should obey. Now the authority
of the priests, which they misused was good for nothing else but to let gods
glory. Howbeit their froward wilfulness, did also make much for the
aduauncyng and setting forth of his power, and goodness.

Jesus therefore, because he was not ignorant where about they went (for what
answer soever he had made, they would have found fault there with: and as yet
the time was not cum for him to disclose and confess who he was) Jesus, I
say, avoided this deceitful question with another wise demand. On this
condition, says he, will I make answer unto your question, if you will
answer me first unto mine. The baptism of John, whether was it from heaven
or of men? Soil me this question. Mark how easlye gods wisdom snarleth
man's wiliness, which uses all the craft and policy that may be,
against it. They had hearts replenished with all worldly subtlety: they
devised all the gylefull ways that could be invented: And yet whiles they made
trains to entrap him, they perceived that there were snares prepared and laid
for themselves.

And they thought in themselves etc.
For they thought thus in their minds: If we say, from heaven, then will he
reply: Why did you not then believe him, when he bare witness of me? If we
say of men, we stand in ieopardie to be assaulted of the people. For John was
of very great authority among the people, and the memory of him was reputed
blessed and holy, because no man doubted but he was a prophet in deed. And for
this cause, albeit they were proud fellows and of an haut courage, yet thought
they it better to be a little ashamed, then openly to be reproved, or stoned to
death.

Therefore unto Jesus, who required an answer, they said: We cannot tell. Then
Jesus paying them home again with a like answer, said unto them: If you know
not to me ward that ye know, neither will I show you by what authority I do
these things that I do. Compare my deeds with John's, and then way and ponder
with your selves whether it be mete, if ye doubted not of his authority, to
doubt of mine.

The.xij. Chapter.

AFter the priests, Scribes and head men had by reason they perceived the
train that was made for them avoided, as well as it would be, the
inconvenience of this question, the lord Jesus put forth unto them another
question by way of a ridle or dark parable, whereunto whiles they unadvisedly
answered; they both condemned their own wickedness, and also granted that
the authority (which they had hitherto somuche bragged and boasted on) ought
worthily to be taken away from them, and given unto other. The parable was
such. A certain man planted a vyneyarde, and hedged it round about, lest it
should be open for man and beast to run into: and dug therein a cester^e to
receive the new wine, and builded also a tower to defend it with all. When it
was in this wise sufficienty furnished with all necessaries thereunto belongyng,
he let it out to hier to husbandmen* and anon as he had so done he went into a
strange country. And when grape time was cum, he sent his servant to the
same husbandmen unto whom he had set it out, to receive of them the fruit
thereof. But they being in a conspiracy, took the servant, and all to beat
him, and sent him home again empty. This notwithstanding ye ientle landlorde
sent again another of his servants. And again he sent an other. etc.
But they now made worse through his lenity and gentleness, cast stones at
him, and brake his head, and sent him likewise away again all to reviled,
without any fruit, but laden with injuries. Yet for all that the same most
gentle lord went not about in all haste to be avenged, but now the third
time sent another servant, and him also they slew. Again after he had sent
diverse of his servants, one after another, And so when he had yet but one
beloved son. etc.
the end and conclusion was, that either they bet them all, or else slew them.
He had then left his only son whom he loved te^derly. Therefore because that
of his wonderful gentleness, he would prove all the ways and means that
might be to reconcyle them, last of all he sent him also unto them, thynckyng
thus with himself: Although they have despised my servants, yet at the least
wise they will reverence this my son. But the malice of the husbandmen
conquered all the lords clemency and goodness. But ye husbandmen said among
themselves etc.
When they saw how his son was cum, then fell they in a conspiracy
together, for a more mischievous purpose. Here now, said they, is the heir:
cum let us kill him, and by this means the whole heritage shall be ours. Then
laid they hands on him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew him.

When the lord had made an end of this parable, he asked the priests, and
scribes: What shall therefore the lord of the vineyarde do unto such
husba^dmen? They not markyng whereunto the parable or similitude tended, so
answered the lord that they gave sentence directly against themselfes. He
shall cum, say they, and punish the husbandmen, and set out the vineyard unto
other more faithful and trusty persons.

When Jesus had allowed this answer, he added a testimony out of ye p^^^e,
seeking for an interpretacion of them who professed the knowledge of the law.
Have ye not read, says he, this scripture following? The Same stone which the
builders refused, is made the head stone of the corner. This was the lords
doing, and it is marvelous in our iyes. Here awakened they and perceived how
their mischievous purposes were not vnowe^ unto Jesus, and understood also that
their incurable malice was plainly described by this dark parable. God
committed unto them his people, as a vineyarde diligently fournished with all
things belonging to the discipline of godlynes to be well husbanded. Then he,
as though he had been in a strange country suffered them to do therewith what
them liked. But they husbanded it to their own profit and commodity, and
nothing for the lords behoof, who ought of right to have received the fruit
thereof. When they were slack and neglygent in doing of their duty, he warned
them thereof by diverse prophets: but for all that they waxed every day worse
and worse, and at the length were ready to expulse Jesus his only son out of
Jerusalem, and put him to death perswadyng themselfes that he being once
slain, they should be the only lords and proprietaries of the vineyarde. But
contraryewyse it was then to cum to pass, that by the most just vengeance
and punishment of God (whom they had so many times and often despised) the
temple, and sovereignty of religion should be taken quite from them, and
given to the apostles. For afterward Jesus (who was by the^ as a naughty
stone, cast out of the building of the Synagoge) was contrary to their
expectacion chosen by the will of God, to be the head corner stone, in the
building of the church, that should be builded both of the Jews, They went
about also to take him.
and Gentiles: to thentent that he being the middle, and immovable stone,
should hold together those two peoples, as it were both the walls of the same
church, in one euangelike and christen faith.

They understood the Parable, they knew the Prophecye, and yet blinded with
obstynate malice would not turn from their wickedness, but for fear of the
people that stood round about them, went their way from Jesus, entendyng to
bring about by pryuye traynes, and subtyltie, what they could not openly do.
Surely there is none so mischeuous a kind of manslaughter, as that which is
cloked with a color of justice and holiness.

Wherefore making as though themselfes had been quiet, and no medlers, they set
a work certain notable wicked persons of the Phariseis, and the Herodians
which dissented in doctrine among themselfes, but in hatyng of Jesus agreed
all in on. Oh folysh wisdom of this world. They that have been so oftymes put
to the worse, do often times cumme again, and assail him, to thentent it may
appear that they are at all says vanquished, and in conclusion depart their
way as unequal matches to cope or encounter with Gods wysdom. For now was
it time that Satan (who of late assailed the Lord, but went away with loss of
victory) should by his guard, and mynisters bring forth all his artyllary and
engines against him.

Therefore they that are set up to play this part, For thou considerest not*
etc.
go unto Jesus, and propoune unto him a capcious question, because to seek
some occasion of his words, and answers thereunto* whereby they may have him
condemned before themperours deputy. They begin with a very flatering proheme,
as though he could be deceived with fair words, who so often times declares
how there is nothing that he knows not. Master, say they, we know right
well that thou art a teller of truth, and fear no man, but frankely
speak the truth without regard of person. Neither art thou any whyt moved
with the dignity, or high authority of any manne (as many other b^, that
flatter and coury favor with potentates and great men) but (men
contemned) thou trewly teach what god has commanded. Therefore tell us
also we pray the: Is it lawful for us to pay tribute unto the emperor? or is
it not lawful? The phariseis held stiffly that the Jews, being a people
dedicated unto god, ought not to be tributories unto Heathen Emperors, and
worshyppers of Idolles.

On the other side, the herodians defended themperous right. This deceitful
proheme tended hereunto, that if he had given sentence for the pharyseis, then
should he have been accused of the Herodians for an author of rebellyon, or
insurreccion against the emperor. Jesus, unto whom their craft and wylines was
not unknown, being not contented with them, for that they came not to learn,
But ^e understood their simulacion.
but to tempt him, answered: Why do you tempte me? bring me forth a penny
that I may see it. And byanby it was brought him. Their service was not to
seek in making of the train, which came purposely to take him in a trippe.
Then looked he on the penny, and said: whose is this Image, and superscripcion?
They answered: themperours. What is this? knew not Jesus (unto whom nothing
is unknown) the Image or title of themperoure: and did the Phariseis and
Herodians know it? Yes verily he knew it well enough, and that before he
looked thereon. But he sought an occasion to make a convenient answer unto
their deceitful question. Here was an ensample given to declare how they ought
to know nothing of princes affairs, And Jesus answered, and said unto them.
whose duty it is, for as much as they profess themselfes to be Christ's
vicars in earth, to preach^, and teach heavenly matters. Now hear an answer
worthy to cum out of Christ's mouth. Yield ye, says he, those things that
pertain to the emperor, to the emperor: and those things that belong to god,
unto god. He disaloweth not, if such as are dedicated unto god, give unto
the emperor, be he never so ungodly and wicked a prince, that, which is due
unto him for governing of the common weal, or what he otherwise violently
exacteth (because that loss of money does not make men ungodly) but he
monisheth us, occasion serving him, of a thing which is more to the purpose,
that is, how all ought to be yelden to god, that is due unto god. A vile piece
of coin had graven in it a title, and image of themperoure. If thou know
this title, and art content to give unto him his duty, how much more then
ought thou to yield unto almighty god (whose Image every manne bears) what
he ought of duty to have? When thou receyuedst Baptysme, Gods image was
printed and graven in thy soul. Why do thou then give it unto the deuell?
Thou gloryest in the name, and title of a Chrystian manne: Why yeideste thou
not unto Christ, that thou ^west him by reason of thy profession? All that
were there present maruayled at this discrete and wise answer. Two sects of
the Jews were now put to silence with one saying.

Then came the sect of Saduceis, who denied the resurreccion of bodies,
auouchyng manne wholly to peryshe after death. Neither believed they that there
was any spirit or Angel, wherein they dissented in opinion from the
Phariseis. These gross fellows had also a capcious question wherewith to tempte
gods wisdom. Jesus did then take upon him the person of an unlearned and
ignoraunte person: but that thing which in him was loweste, was higher, and of
more excellencye then that which in men is hygheste. They assailed him on
this wife: Master, Moises in the book entitled deuteronomium, has left us
this law, that if any married manne dye without issue, his next brother in age
should marry the wydow, and of her beget children to bear the dead man's name,
And if he deceasse without children to, then the next unto him should succeed
in his place or room. (...) were seven brethren.


It chanced that of seven brethren the eldest married a wife: he dyed without
issue: Then came the next brother in age, according to the prescripcion of the
law, and married the widow: and he being likewise departed without children,
the third brother succeeded: and after him all the other by course, unto the
seuenthe, and last manne. Each of them one after another, married her, and each
of them deceassed without issue. At the length the woman also dyed herself.
Therefore when the time of resurreccion shall cumme, and the seven brethren,
and the woman shall reliue, which of them all shall challenge her for his wife?
for in her life time she was like wise married unto them all seven. The Saducies
thought they would by thynco^uenience that they inferred of this case, make
the resurreccion of the dead to apeare a very fond thing, and disagreable to
reason: specially yt there should then rise strife and debate among the
brethren for the wife, which was common unto them all. Jesus grutched not to
teach those gross fellows, saying: Doethe not this question plainly declare
that you be in a wrong belefe, and altogether out of the way, for as much as
ye neither understand the Scriptures, nor yet perceive the power of almighty
God? The Scripture is spiritual: and God who made manne of naught, can raise
him again at his pleasure, from death to life. He will not only make the
dead alive again, but also reward them with life everlasting.

Now wedlock was invented among men for this purpose, because the thing (I
mean mankind) which of it self, and own propre nature contyneweth not for
ever, might by procreacion and encreasyng of the world, be multiplied, For
when they shall arise again etc.
preserved and continued. But whereas men neither dye, nor be borne after the
common course of the world, what needs there any matrimonye? For after the
resurrection of the dead, neither shall any manne mary, nor any manne give his
daughter in marriage to an other: but as the angels of god in heaven, because
there is among them no mortality, know not the use of matrimony: so shall
they that shall be relyued in the general resurreccion, be made like unto the
aungells, their bodies being all spyrytuall and immortal. Furthermore why do
you think it disagreable to reason to believe that the dead shall arise again?
Have ye not read in holy scripture (the authority whereof is counted among you
holy, and inviolable) what god said when he spoke unto Moses out of the
bushe? I am, said he, the god of Abraham, the god of Isaac, and the god of
Jacob, they were then dead, and yet does he call himself their god. Therefore
even the dead do verily live because their souls remain still alive.

And if it be so that their sowles remain, what great maystrye is it then for
God to call them again into their old bodies, wherein they dwelt before? But
if the dead be utterly perished, so that nether body nor soul remains
alive, then stands it not with reason, that he is called the God of the
dead. As no man glories that he is a king of those that are not, so is God
the God of the living, and not of the dead. Wherefore you Saduceis are far
deceived, imagyning that there shall be nothying in the life to cum, Ye are
therefore greatly deceived.
otherwise then you see in this present life. Those things no doubt have a
more true and blessed being which are not under man's corporal light, then
those which are seen with bodily iyes. There is nothing that more truly is,
then god, and yet he is not seen, but felt or perceived.

Yet for all this these wicked fellows made not an end to te^pte Christ. After
the Saduceis came the Pharyseis, and the Scrybes, who were encouraged to take
him in hand, because he hit the Saduceis in the teethe with ignorance of the
law. For the Scribes and the Phariseis auaunt themselfes more then other, for
the great knowledge they pretend to have in ye same: and dissenting in opinion
from the Saduceis, do believe there are angles, and spirits: and that men's
souls remain alive after the bodies be dead: and finally that the dead shall
rise again. These fellows being right glad that the Saduceis were put to a
foil and blancked, and that Jesus had answered to their minds, did like
learned men, propoune and put forth unto him by one of the scribes, set up
for the nones to play this part, a notable question out of the most inward
mysteries of the law. They asked him what was the chief, and greatest
commandment in the whole law? Jesus straightwayes answered them out of the
book entyled Deuteronomium, where as it is written on this wise: He asked him
which is the first. etc.
Hear O Israel, the lord thy God is one god, and thou shall love the lord
thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
with all thy strength. This is the chief and greatest commandment: next unto
this, is that that follows: Thou shall love thy neyboure none otherwise then
thyselfe. There is no other commandment greater then these two, because they
comprise the sum and effect of the whole law. When the Scribe heard him say
so, he said again: Thou have well and truly answered how there is one God, and
none other but he, and that to love him with all the heart, and with all the
understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, is a thing
which passes all burnt offrynges, and other sacrifices. Jesus perceyuyng that
he had right discretly answered, said unto him: Thou art not far from the
kingdom of God. For the euangelyke godlynes stands not in sacrifices of
beasts, but in cleannes of spirit. He is not far from this meaning, whosoever
prefers that commandment which is spiritual simple or plain, before all
other precepts, which be rather figures and tokens of true godliness, then the
thing self. But the common sort of the Jews believe verily that the chiefest
part of virtue and godly living, stands in visible things, as in washinges,
in keeping of the sabbath day, in choice of meats, in offered gifts, in
sacrifices, in holy days, in fastinges, and in long prayers. Whosoever with all
his heart loves god, for gods self (the which can never be loved enoughe) and
his neybour for gods sake: the same has made sufficient sacrifice. After that
Jesus had thus with his wisdom every where confounded and ouercum them, that
ceased they to tempt him, lest they should have departed with greater shame,
And no man after that durst ask him any question.
if they had been still reproved in the presence of the people. They counted
Jesus for an ignorant person, and anaunted and set out themselves among the
simple and unlearned people, what with their magnifike and hye titles, and what
with their tragical and maskyng apparel, as though they had been almost god
almighties peers. Howbeit the euangelike and godly wysdom, stands not in the
multitude of sciences but in pureness of spirit. As Jesus was reputed among
the scribes, Phariseis, priests, and head me^ of the people, so afterward
were the apostles taken for rude and ignorant persons among the Philosophers,
rulers, and princes.

But although the Scribes and Phariseis ceased to tempte Jesus, yet ceased not
to teach them. For when he had propouned unto them being assembled altogether,
a question, and asked whole son was Messiah whom they waited for, and they
had answered again out of the Prophets, the son of David: Now say the
Scribes y^ ^or^^, etc,
he moved a doubt that none of them all could assoyle, saying: how stands it
that Messiah is the son of David, since David himself inspired with the holy
ghost, speaks in the Psalm as follows? The lord said unto my lord, sit
on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footestole* Since thauctoritie
of the progenitoures is greater then is thauctoritie of the of spring and
neuewes, by what reason then does David call him, who shall be borne of his
seed, his lord? It is a like thing, as though the father would call the son
Lord. The Scribes, and the Phareseis, who had in them the spirit of the
flesh, as yet understood not this mystery. David inspired with ye holy ghost,
saw in Christ, who was not then borne, a thing far above the nature of man, where as himself was nothing else but a man. Now when the Scribes, and
Phariseis held their peace, and could make no answer hereunto, the most
part of the people favored Jesus, and had a great delight to hear him dispute
and reason the matter.

Wherefore Jesus perceiving them to be curable, and knowing also how the
priests, And he said unto them
Scribes and Phariseis of a purpensed malice* perseuered in their ungracious
purpose, began openly to disclose their naughtynes in thaudyence of the people,
not because to backbyte and slander them: but he took from the^ the visure of
counterfaite virtue and holiness, lest they should from thenceforth any more
deceive the people. For now the time required that he should so do. Therefore
putting forth and preaching unto them his own doctrine, that is to say, a
francke doctrine, and such a one as flattereth and coureth favor with no man, he said: beware lest the royal show of the Scribes, and Phariseis
deceive you. Which deuou^ wydowes houses. etc.
They study not your soul health, but their own glory. For they covet to
go in long roabes down to the ancle, to thentent they may appear to be men
of geat perfeccion: and they seek after salutacions in ye market place, and the
preferment of the chief seat in assemblies: and in all feasts, and bankets
the first place or uppermost room of the table. They use also long prayers,
because they may seem holyer then other. And by reason of souche colored
holiness, they crepe into the favor of blessed and godly wydowes, but
simple withal: which for diverse causes are apt to be deceived, either
because of the weakness of their sex and kind, Th^se shall receive greater
^a^n^cio^.
or for that they be wydowes, and lack husbands to defend them, or else
because they be rich and wealthy. To the^ cum they of their own swinge, under
pretense to be their patrones, and defendours, and with their counterfayte
holiness devour up their houses. But so little shall this their Hipocrisy
profit them that they shall be more greuouslier damned of god, for so much
as they covered their naughtynes with a color of holy and virtuous living.
Therefore take ye good head of those, lest ye be deceived.

These things done, Jesus went into that part of ye temple where the treasury
was, wherein the offered gifts were kept, and sytting directly against it,
beheld those that made their oblacion, And many that were rich cast in much.
and cast in gifts. And many rich folks cast in great gifts, whom the
priests would therefore should be counted as it were more holier then
other, measuring their godlynes, after the rate and measure of the gift that
they offered.

In the mean season there came also a certain poor wydowe, and threw in two
little pieces of coin, which made a ferthing. There was none among them all
that preferred not those rich folks before this poor woman. But Jesus
judgment far differs from the judgment of the Scribes, and Phariseis, the
which thing he would not have his disciples ignorant of. I tell you, says
he, for a certainty, this widow, be she never so poor, has given more to
the treasury, then all the other, which seem to have given most lauishely.
For the other gave of their abundaunt superfluity. They gave much, howbeit
they reserved more to themselfes. But this woman of her little poor substance,
has given all together, reserving nothing unto her self. For God does not
esteem the gift after the measure and value of the thing that is given, but
after thaffeccion and mind of the geuer. Jesus is pleased with such a wydowe,
and dayneth to be her spouse and conforter. The Synagoge like a proud
housewyfe boasts and craketh upon the riches of her righteousness: she
boasts upon her rich orname^tes of good works. She glories in her
houseba^de Moses, unto whom she was never obedient: She auaunteth herself,
because the prophets were her sons, whom she either slew with wicked
murder, or at the least wise persecuted. She has ever in her mouth, the
lords temple, the law of God, the Patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and
Israel. She goes with her guard of priests, Scribes, and Phariseis. But the
church like a poor wydowe has nothing to boast upon. She knowledgeth lack
of good works: and yet that litl^ that she has, she wholly dedicateth and
offers unto God. Now what can be poorer then such a wydowe, as leaves
herself nothing at all? She knowledgeth not Moses to be her husband, because
she knowethe not circumcision: because she abhorrethe the sacryfices of
beasts, being contented wholely to have offered up her self unto almyghtie
God. The Lord her spouse, inasmuche as he has forsaken the yearthe, and is
returned into heaven, semethe to have forsaken his wydowe: which now like a
woman destitute of all succoure, is spoiled, banished, imprisoned, afflicted,
and oppressed both of the Jews and Gentyles. She hears daily: where is thy
spouse? It semethe that she will starve for hunger, which having so small
substance, has clean forgone that little she had, and left herself
nothing. It semethe she will dye shortly with reproach of baraines, which has
lost her housband. But this widow which after the judgment of the world is
past all health, and utterly undone, the prophet Esaie comfort on this
wise: Be thou glad thou barayne that bryngest forth no fruit: break forth and
cry thou ye trauailest not: for the desolate has many mo children then she
that has an husband. Do not we se that this prophecy is fulfilled? The
synagoge is hongry, and dyethe. The church is encreaced and spread abroad,
triumphing in Martyrs, flourishing in Virgins, and reioysynge in so many
thousands of Confessors. She has not one farthing of her own proper riches:
but of her spouses riches, she has tried gold, fine and pure: she has
precious stones inestimable. For through sincere and pure faith toward her
rich spouse, whatsoever he has, she has the same. The synagoge, albeit she
seemed to give much unto God, yet did she reserve more unto her self then was
sufficient. Wylt thou see the Synagoge giving her gifts* hear the Pharisey
praying: I thank the Lord, says he, that I am not such a one as other men be.
Now mark me how much he reserueth unto himself when he says: I fast twyse
in the weke. I give the tenthe part of all my goods unto poor people. On the
other side, mark the fashion of the wydow. She knocks her breast, she dares
not once lift up her iyes to heaven ward, she does nothing but cry: God be
merciful unto me a sinner. The Sinagoge, whiles she craketh upon her own
justice has neither any of her own, nor yet gods justice. The church whiles
she renounceth and puts away from her all glory of righteousness and
knowledgeth her own unrighteousness, is enriched with the justice and
righteousness of her spouse.

The.xiij. Chapter.

THere was nothing in the temple that pleased Jesus, save the poor wydowe
only, in the which temple there was nothing else, but counterfayte devotion,
and feigned holiness. Let us also, who profess our selves to be the disciples of
Jesus, depart out of the Jewish temple. Let us set aside all trust of
carnal works, and embrace the ryghteousnes of the euangelike and chrystian
faith.

Therefore our savior departed thence to build an other temple, which should
be holy and spiritual in deed: and of buyldyng so substanciall, sure, and
strong, One of his disciples said unto him.
that the very gates of hell should never be able to prevail against it.
When he was gone out, one of his disciples said unto him: Master, behold
how great and houge are the stones of this temple, and what a strong
buildinge is here: couertlye meaning that it was a stronger piece of work
then that it could by process of time fall in decay or ruin. Oh Iewishe
iyes. They outwardly maruayled at stones couched and heaped together by man's
hand, as though Jesus had been delited with such a buyldyng. Jesus answered
again: Seeste thou this great and curious edifice? There shall a time cum
when there shall not one stone remain upon another vnthrowen down: much
less then shall the same buyldyng continue for ever. Now Jesus lotheth, and
contemnethe all that ever is seen with bodily iyes, for the great desire he
has of his ghostly and spyritual temple. As he sat in that part of mount
Olyuete (where he chose his lodging for that night) from whence the temple of
Jerusalem might be seen, And as he sat on most Oliuete.
the disciples called again to their remembrance his words, whereby he had
told before how it should cumme to pass, that the said temple should be
destroyed both stycke and stone, even from the very foundation. For they
supposed that the kingdom of god, whereon they ceased not as yet to dream,
should cum immediatlye after the destruction thereof. Therefore four of them,
that is to wete, Peter, James, John, and Andrewe, went priu^lye unto him as he
there sat, to the intent that like as he had showed unto a few persons apart,
the mystery of his transfiguracion, so should he likewise disclose unto the^,
being but a few, all the secrets concerning the time when his kingdom
should cumme and begin: which thing he would not perhaps open unto all the
other. And for this cause they said unto him: Tell us when these things shall
cum to pass, and by what token we may know when the same ^yme is already cum
and present. The Lord who had already weded out of his disciples all carefulnes
for sustenaunce, desire of reuengement, and providence of life or forecastyng
how to live, would also wede out of their minds all such curiosity as
makes a man over busy and inquisitiue, to know such things, as nothing
appertain unto his salvation. Therefore he so tempreeth his words, that by
the same he sygnifieth not only that the city of Jerusalem shall one day be
destroyed, but also that after his departure, grievous storms of persecution
shall rise against the preachers of the gospel: and finally that the end of
the world, or domes day shall cumme. But as it is expedient for all men to
know how they shall one day make an end of this present life, to thentent
they may ever make themselves ready against the same, so his will and pleasure
was to have his disciples fullye persuaded, that a time should likewise cumme,
when he would return into the world again, a judge both of the quick and
dead: but when that time should come, because it was not expedient, he would
in no wise have it known. Therefore he began to speak of these matters, in
such wise as here ensues.

Beware, says he, lest any manne deceive you. For there shall many come who
will challenge and take upon them my name, and every of them will feign
himself to be Christ, and by his crafty delusion, deceive many
uncircumspect persons.

The great busynes and rufflyng of the world, will show that my cu^ming
approaches, and the world is nighe at an end. But you must not strayghtwayes
when wars are moved, or when there is any terrible brute or rumoure of
wars to be moved, be so dismayed therewith, as though the same time were already
present. For these things shall cum, and yet shall not the end of the world
furthwith ensue. They shall only be preludes of the end yt is to come, even as
in an old man's body, diseases oftetymes thauncing, are foretokens that his
body shall shortly decay and perish. The temperature of the qualities is the
thing which preserves bodily health.

But when by reason the same qualities, do strive one against another, the
whole body is distempered, then is it an argument that the destruction thereof
approchethe. There shall nation rise against nation, realm against realm,
and one of them go about with great powers, and hosts of men, For there shall
nation arise against nation.
to destroy an other. Moreover the yearthe it self, as though it were not
content to norishe so wicked and ungodly people, shall be shaken with
yearthequakes, and so shall there be in sondrie places of the world great
dearthe and famyne, because it shall deny men their natural food and
sustenaunce. Furthermore the air as though it were angrye with the same ungodly
folks, unworthy of life and breathe, shall be noysomme, and deadelye. When ye
see many of these signs and tokens, yet look ye not byanby for domes day.
For these euiles shallbe only the beginning of the calamity to come.
Neither shall your selves be free from such evils and troubles. And therefore
look well about ye, lest ye be clapte in the necks or creye be ware. For
men shall accuse you, and bring you before councels and synagoges: and ye
shall be presented before kings and rulers, to answer in causes of life, and
death: not for any offense, or evil deed done on your behalf, but only for
the profession of my name: and this shall they do because all the world may
know, how they were worthily cast out of the kingdom of God, since they
so persecuted the preachers of the same. But let not these things much
trouble your minds. The cruelnes of wicked persons shall bring nothing to
pass against the proceeding of the gospel. Neither can any man slay you
before your time. For domes day shall not come, before the gospel be preached
throughout all the world.

You need not therefore to prepare you any worldly succors against the
violence and tyranny of persecutours, or take thought how to escape their
judgments. When there is any accion commensed against you, look ye go, and
appear, lest ye seem to despise the public authority. For this thing also
shall make much for the enlarging and spreading abroad of the gospel. But when
ye are going to appear, be you not careful, studying with your selfs what
answer to make, and how to tell your tale, for that ye are not seen in ye
law, but men ignorant in civil plees: as the common sort of the people are
wont to be careful in such case, who make Orators and Rhetorcians their
atturneys, and proetours in pleadinge of matters. For it is not ye that speak.
But whatsoever cumme the unto your minds, that speak you. For your selves
shall not be authors of such words as you shall speak, but instruments
only. The holy ghost shall speak by you, The brother shall deliver up the
brother, etc,
such things as shall be expedient for the busynes of the gospel. But such
persecucions must ye not only look for of alyauntes, and enemies, but also of
your friends, and kynnesfolkes. For one brother shall take the law of an
other, and accuse him of death worthy crimes, all natural love and affeccion
cast aside. And the father shall likewise accuse the son, contrary to
natural love and kyndnes. Furthermore the children shall also rise against
their parents, and cause them to suffer death.

And where as ye hurt no body, but bring the tydinges of salvation to all
men: yet shall ye be hated of all them that love this world, only for the
dyspleasure and malice they bear to my name, which you shall preach. But in
all these evils it shall be needful for you to be armed with perseueraunce and
constancy of mind. For whosoever continues in his good beginninges to the end,
shall be safe, because no calamity is able to destroy him, that with constant
heart and mind believes the gospel.

If ye require a sign to give you knowledge when this extreme calamity
hangs over your heads: when ye shall see the abhominacion that makes
desolacion standing in ye place where it is not beseming it should stand, then
let him which readethe Daniels prophecy, understand it. For then it shall be
high time for every man, al other things omitted and left undone to shyfte
for himself by flyeng away and to save his life, not by wordelye aids, Let
him that reads understand.
but by swyftnesse of flighte. Then let all that be in Iewrye, the
nourishingeste, and most famous part of the countreye, fly unto the deserte
and wild Mountains. If this calamity take any man on the house top let
him not go down into the house, nor enter into his parloure, or chamber to
fetch out any thing from thence: but as he is found, so let him get him
away and begone. And if at that season any manne be labourynge in the fields
naked, and without clothes, let him not run home again to fetch a way his
cloak, or mantel, but fly straight way some whither else: so swifte shall the
flood of ye misery and calamity be, which shall ouerflow this cou^treye.
Therefore in woeful case shall they be which are great with child, and they
also that have children sucking on their breasts, Woe shall be then to the^ that
are with child.
because nature will not let such as are with child to cast away their burden:
nor natural kindness suffer the other to fly away from their children. And
the only way to save the life shall be to fly without any taryinge. Therefore
desire you of god, that this calamytie chance not in the winter season, nor
upon the Sabbothe day. For ye must not only fly away as fast as your
legs will bear you, but also a great way of. But winter season because the
day is than short, is an ill time to fly far in. And the law for fendeth to
travail far upon the Sabbath day.

(...) that your flight.
All that the lord hitherto said, is spoken in such wise, that it seems
partlye to pertayne to the destruction of the city of Jerusalem: partelye to
the times of persecutions, which were most sharp, and vehemente, at what
season Stephan was stoned to death: and partly to the last end of the
world or domes day. Yet is there included in the same words, a moral
sense, which teach the us, how that being delivered from all worldly
impedimentes, and encumbraunces, we ought always to wait for the cummynge of
that day, when we shall be presented before almyghtye god to receive our dome
and judgment. He can never be prepare against the same, who either for love
of temporal things, or else through thenforcement of carnal affeccions, that
is to say, for his parents, wife, or chyldrens sake, is called back again
to the danger of the losyng of everlasting salvation. He is laden with a
vessel, who being ouercharged and let with worldly riches, cease to do
those things which pertayne to eternal health. He is burdened with a
mantell, who for taking head unto the body, regards not the soul. He is
slow of foot by carrying of an infant, who by reason of natural affections,
refrayneth not from those things which he knows right well are by all manner
of means to be exchew^dme hastes to that tayning of those, which he knows
ought (all lettes and impedimentes set aside) greatly to be desired. Winter
takes them flying, who for the little light that their weak faith gives, and
because charity is cold and faynte in them, do not finishe their journey,
and manfully go through whither they began to go. Moreover the
supersticious obseruacion of the Sabbath brings those persons into danger,
who by reason of an unright and aukeward judgment, tremble and quake for
fear, where there is no cause of fear: and where they ought chiefly to fear
in deed, are feareles: as when a man is bold to transgress the
commandment of God, for fearelest he break man's constitucions. For the
Lord himself taught openly that the Jews Sabbothe was well contemned, and
broken, for man's health and preseruacion.

Furthermore the words that ensue, seem rather to pertayne to the last day of
the world, before the which day, great business, and hurly burly shall
universally happen for the cummyng of Antichrist. For there shall be in those
days.
Those days, sayethe he, shall be so full of miseries on every side, that
there has not been like tribulacion and affliction from the creacion of the
world unto this day, nor hereafter shall be. If this affliction should long
while continue, as it shall be fell, and cruel for the season, there should
not one man be saved. But God of his infinite mercy and goodness has provided,
that this storm shall short while endure, for their sakes, whom he has
chosen to life everlasting. For of these will he suffer none to perish, what
storm of evils soever shall arise. Wherefore there is no cause why any man
should fear himself, so that he persevere and abide still in the euangelike
and christian faith, as nighe unto the shote anchor or surest refuge. No
puissaunce shall cast them down, which have a constant belief in me.

Only take heed that instead of me, you embrace not another Christ. There
shall be more ieoperdy of deceyuers, then of persecutours. For there shall
arise in those days false Christ's, who shall untruly challenge and take upon
them my name, and person. There shall arise also false Prophets, which under
a cloak and colored show of holiness, shall feign themselfes to be Prophets:
and in working of Magical wonders, and miracles cloked by crafty illusions of
devils, Lo, here is (...). etc.
follow the prophets, and me, so that even the very elect (if any power
could prevail against God) may be deceived by such ligierdemayne, and
iuglynge castes: Therefore if any man shall say unto you: Lo, here is
Christ, believe him not: or if any call you back to another place, and say:
lo, here he is: what place, what apperaunce of things, or what manner of
honor or serving of god soever he show you, believe him not. For after that
Christ has once forsaken the world, he cannot be showed nor pointed to with
fyngers, but will lie hid in men's souls, and this shallbe the sign and token
to know where he is: when any does with his life, and conversation express
his doctrine, and put it in execucion. Howebeit he will not cumme at domes
day, so as he now cummethe, but will suddenly and unlooked for show himself
from any high after the manner of a flashe of lyghtening, dreadful to the
wicked, who shall be cast into everlasting fire: and again amiable and louelye
to godly persons, which shall be called to the fellowship of the heavenly
kingdom. Therefore if you chance to live in these days, be ware ye embrace
not instead of me, sum counterfayte Christ.

Lo, I have told you all things beforehande. There remains behind, that
you retain and keep my words in memory.

Now after these forsayed calamities, wars, persecucions, famyne,
pestilence, and earthquakes be paste, there shall also ensue many other
wonderful signs and tokens out of heaven, all the elements being, as it were
yrefully set to take vengeance upon the wicked people. For the Sun, the
fountain of light, And then shall they see ye son of man. etc.
shall wexe dark, thereby as it were embraiding the ungodly with their
blyndnes, because they would not see the everlasting sun and lantern of the
world. Neither shall the Moon, which is wont to shine in the night, and put
away ye darkness thereof, give her light yt she boroweth of the Su^ne.
Furthermore men shall see the stars fall down from the firmament to the
earth, which have been so many hu^ndred years there fastened for man's behoue
and commodity. And besides this, the powers of the heavens (by virtue whereof
those merueylouse bodies have continued, even from the creation of the world,
their courses and offices appointed the^ of god) shall be moved: so great shall
the fear be of the dreadful day of dome approaching. These things done, all
that be then alive, shall suddenly, and with the twynkelyng of an iye, see the
soonne of man (who is now taken for an vnderlynge, and not regarded) appear
in the highest clouds with great puyssaunce, and in the glory of the father,
and with him innumerable multitudes of Angels. Then will he send out his
Angels, who will let none of his chosen be away, but will assemble the^
altogether from every quarter, whether they be quyc^e, or else dead, but must
suddenly be reliued again: he will send them out, I say, to gather all the
members of the mystical body unto their head, to thente^t that they which
have been partakers of afflictions and persecutions for the gospelles sake,
may likewise be companions and partakers with him, of everlasting joy and
blysfulnesse. It skylleth not whither that good me^ns souls have gone, neither
into what place their karkases have been thrown:: Aungeles shall find them
out, and gather them together from the four quarters of the world: and again
from the highest pole of heaven, to the low most. Every soul shall be joined
unto his own proper body, and all the elect and chosen people shall likewise
be conjoined unto their head.

Learn a similitude of the fig^tee, when his branch is yet tender, and has
brought forth leaves, ye ^^owe that summer is nere. So in like manner when ye se
these things cum to pa^se, understand that he is ^ye, even at the doors.
Uerely* I say unto you, that this generation shall not pass; till these
things be done. Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass.
But of the day, time knows no man, (...) not the Angels which are in
heaven: neither the son himself. save the father only. Now lest this day
cum suddenly upon you, when ye are nothing at all prepared, you may guess by
certain foresygnes and conjectures, when it is nere hand, even as ye may
conjecture and gather by the fygge tree that summer will shortly cum. For when
the branches of this tree begin once to wax soft and tender, being about to
bring forth their first fruit called grossi, and when the leaves be already
budded out, ye know that su^mer is not far of. But it is much certayner
that that day shall cum, then it is certain, that summer follows after
winter. This thing do I auouche unto you: This age shall not pass till all
these things shall happen. Among corporal things there is nothing more
stable and sure then heaven: nothing more immovable then is the earth: but yet
both heaven and earth shall sooner alter and change their nature, then my
words be vain, and of none effect. Be ye not careful to know certeynly when
that same last day shall cum, forasmuch as it is not given unto ye Angels to
know it: no nor yet to the son himself. For ye father has reserved this
secret knowledge to himself alone, because he perceived it was expedient for
your soul health he should so do. Be you most certainly assured that it shall
cum: but ask ye not when, lest by this means ye becum careless. Beware
always and take good head: watch and pray continually, since you are
uncertain when that dreadful day shall cum upon you. You shall take good head
if you will not trust unto worldly aides, neither put confidence in any
worldly creature: but wholly hang upon me, and my commandments. Ye shall
watch, if by refraining from superfluity, and all bodily pleasures, you will
wholly bend your selves to holiness of spirit, and virtuous living. You shall
pray, if you will most fervently desire those things, which are promised unto
the^ that still persevere and continue in the profession of the gospel. Satan
has his crafts to deceive even wise, and circu^spect persons. Against these
crafts you must use the wysedom, and policy of the serpent. The world, and the
flesh have their entisinges, wherewith they so delight the minds of recheles
folks, that (as I may call it) sleep, security, and forgetfulness of things
eternal, crepeth upon the^ ere they be ware. Of these things spryngeth either
contempt, or else despera^ce of the kingdom of heaven. God will not clean
forsake his chose^, but he loves wakefull and heedefull persons: yet will he
that when they have done what may be done by man's endeuoyre and diligence, they
nevertheless cease not to pray, fully persuadyng themselves how it is God yt
gives the beginning, proceeding, and consu^mation of everlasting blisfulnes. So
watch you, as though God will forsake you for a time: so pray you, as
though whatsoever ye go about, shall cum to none effect, without he put to
his helping hand. And because the Lord Jesus would the depeliet fasten this
doctrine in ye minds of his disciples, he added a similitude very fit for the
purpose. When I shall forsake you, says he, so demean your selves, as
faithful and wise servants would do, unto whom the Lord being about to make
a voyage into a strange country, has given authority to order and guide his
house: and has assigned to each of them his work, As a man which is gone
into a strange country, etc.
and office. Furthermore he has commanded the porter to watch for fear of
night thieves. These servants, because they be uncertain of their Lords
returnyng home, do still endeuoyre themselves to do their office and duty,
that whenever it shall chance him to cum home again, he may find them
watching. It is more certain that I shall cum again to you, then that their
lord shall eftsoon return unto them. There may sum chance befall, that he
miscary whiles he is from home in the strange country. But as sure as God is
in heaven, I will cum again, albeit the day when, be to you uncertain.
Therefore do you as good and thriftie servants are wont to do. Ever watch and
look after my retourning. You cannot tell when the Lord will cum, at even, or
at mydnyght: whethre at the Cock crowyng, or in the dawning of the day, lest
if he cum sodainlye (as he will cum in very deed) he find you sleapyng, and
slack, or negligent in doing of your duty. That I speak to you, I speak by
you to all that shall be borne until the world be at an end: watch you.
Every man must watch that will be saved: Every man must do the work that
the Lord has committed unto him, but especially and above all other, it
behooves the porter to watch, who watches for the safeguard of the whole
family. And although the people do sumtymes take a nappe, yet has the
shepeherde no leisure to sleep. Now is all this present life (wherein is no
certain difference between good things and bad, and wherein is exceeding much
ignorance or blyndnesse, and very little light) all this life I say, is in
comparison of the life to cum, And that I say unto you, etc,
nothing else but night. And albeit that in the end of the world the Lord will
cum once for all, to all men generally, yet comes he also to every man
severally at the hour of death. Therefore every man particularly ought to
watch against this his cumming, because it is even as uncertain as the other.
For he cummeth unto sum late in the euenyng, as in growyng age: to sum at
mydnyghte, as when they are in their flowers, and best lykyng: to other sum at
the Cockecrowyng, that is to wete, in old age. Ye must neither trust to
your strength, nor to your age. The time and hour of death is like uncertain
to all men.

The.xiiij. Chapter.

Now that most holy, and solemn feast of Easter drue nyghe, that is to
say, of Phasc, which word signifiethe in the Hebrew tongue, a passing over,
on the which day y^ holy blood of the unspotted lamb should deliver us from
the vengeance of the sleying sword, and being brought out of Egypt through
the red sea, and wilderness of this world, bring us unto the heavenly
Jerusalem, into a countreye flowing with milk and honye. For the Jews
passover, which they yearelye celebrate and keep most high and holy, was
nothing else but a figure and shadow of this sacrifice, like as was this
ceremony, that they did on these days forbear leauened bread, exhorting us
hereby, to such purity and cleanesse of life, as becummeth a professor of ye
gospel. After two days expired, the day that they called the preparyng day
should be. But as the chief priests and S^ribes, devoutly prepared and made
themselves ready to celebrate this corporal passover: so did they like
unwise fellows, wickedly make haste to offer up thatsame true lamb which
that solemn sacrifice had so many hundred years figured. For now were they
at a full point to slay Jesus: but because they durst not openly do it, for
fear of the people, they thought good to lay hands upon him, and put him to
death by gyle and treason. And for this their purpose, that day of all other,
was most convenient to thentent the thing of the new testament, But they say
not in ye ^east day. etc.
should agree with the figure of the old. They themselves, did not chose this
day, but it was foreapointed unto this sacrifice by the eternal decree and
ordinance of the father. For they counseylyng to gether how to slay Jesus,
said: Not on the feast day, lest there arise any business and hurly burly
among the people. Doubtless it is a Iewyshe fear to stand in awe of men,
and all this while nothing to dread god at all. Jesus knowing the time was
cum, in the which it was the fathers will to have that same everlasting
sacrifice to be made, departed not from Jerusalem, lest he should have seemed
to have failed at the place foreapointed unto this business.

When he therefore feasted at Bethany with his friends, in the house of Simon,
surnamed the leper, one of the geastes that feasted with him was Lazarus. This
house presents unto us, the agreyng, and friendly fellowship of the church:
the which being unclean, he washed and purified with his preuous blood: and
being dead through sin, and unrighteousness, he made alive again by his
death and passion. With such persons, Jesus loves to sit at table, rather
then with the priests, and phariseis, who thought themselves ^leane, and
alive, notwithstanding they were such in soul, as Simon, and Lazarus were in
body. As they thus feasted, there came in a certain woman having and
alabaster box full of pure, good, and precious oyntement, called the ointment
of right Narde: which brake her box: and powered all the ointment upon the
Lords head, as he sat there at the table. Jesus who was never delited with
the pleasures and delicacies of this world, loves to be anointed with such
manoure of ointment, after the spiritual meaning. The church is lauishe and
prodigal in bestowing this ointment upon her dear and well-beloved spouse. What
precious thing soever she has, the same reserueth she not to herself, but
powers it upon Jesus head, unto whom all honor and glory is due. The house
of ye church is in most ample wise enlarged and spread abroad throughout all ye
whole world: but the sweet savor, and fragrau^t smell of this ointment has
filled every corner and part thereof. This sweet savor allureth and causes
many a one to desire that they may be admitted into the same house, wherein
Jesus sits at meat with his friends. But there be sum which of spite and
envy, speak against the delicacies of Jesus: as the Jews, who rather seek
their own profit, glory, and commodity, then the glory and honor of Jesus
Christ. For so did certain of his disciples y^ yet sauoured of the flesh, but
specialy Judas Iscarioth: who being not contented in his mind, and muttryng
with himself against this womannes fac^e, said on this wise: what neded it to
wast or cast away this so pure good ointment? For it might have been sold for
three hundred pence, and with that money many a poor body have been relieved.
And the loss of this ointment grieved them so much, that they made a great
murmuring against the godly prodigality of the woman. That thing is well
lost, which is employed upon Christ's glory: Yea, to say the truth, there
is nothing that less perishes. The sinagoge is sparing to Christeward, What
need this waste of oyntme^t etc.
and wastefull or prodigal to her own person. Contrarily, the church
regards not the price and valewe of that she has received of Christ, but
breaks the vessel, and rashlye powers out all that ever she has upon her
spouses head. The poor wydowe which cast a farthing into the treasury,
pleased Christ hyghly. So does this woman content him also, which for his love
and sake, has lost her precious ointment. The widow knowleagyng her poverty,
brought forth all the poor substance she had, and cast it into the
treasurye: and the other being now rich and wealthy through the lords
liberality, did not only give him all that ever she had, but also sustained
the lose of her vessel. The one gave her goods and living: the other gave even
body and soul, if that can perish which is given unto Jesus. Where be they
now that grudge and murmoure against this prodigality, which is so pleasant
and acceptable to the aucthoure of grace? Christ gives of his own
plentifully, to thentent that the good savor of his liberality, may the more
be spread abroad: He requires no reward for any thing he geuethe: but here
only he is ambicious or desirous of honor. He wills that we knowleage his
well doing and benefits, not because he has any need of such praise and
commendacion, but it has pleased him by this mean to give us his gifts and
riches.

The Lord (of whom alone it is sufficient to be allowed) defends the godly
diligence of the woman against his disciples muttryng and murmuryng against
her. For ye have poor. etc.
Why, says he, make you this business with this woman? Suffer her to take her
pleasure. She has done me a good turn. For whereas you cloak your
covetousness with a pretense to socour the pore, know ye y^ whatsoever is
given to me, the same is given to a poor body. These commune poor folks, and
beggars, you shall ever have with you, whom you may do good unto, and help as
often as ye will: but ye shall not always have me present, to win my favor by
such corporal benefytes. I have been but once in my life time thus honored,
and the thing that is done, is not done to thentent that many should take
ensample thereby, to use such manor of bodilye refreshinges: but because all
men should after the spiritual sense and meaning do the like. This woman
wotteth not what she does, and yet with a godly endeavor and diligence does
she as much as lies in her to do. My death is nere hand, then will she
desire to anoint my body that must be buried. And because she shall not then
have time so to do, she preueuteth the time: and yeldeth me that honor whiles
I am alive, which she cannot give me when I am dead. But so true is it that her
godly endeuoire (which you speak and murmour against) shall not lack it
condign and worthy praise, that when my death shall by preaching of the
gospel, be renoumed and spoken of throughout all the whole world, she shall
likewise be remembered and spoken of, because she honored it with such a gift
and present before I dyed.

With these words the Lord caused his disciples to cease their muttring. But
Judas Iscarioth one of the twelve (who untruly dispensed the common money
given for the relief of the poor) could in no wise suffer the loss of this
ointment, When they heard that, they were glad.
but went streightwayes unto the high priests, to betraye Jesus unto the^.
For it was not unknown unto him, how they studied to take him by deceyte and
treason. After the high priests heard this, they were right glad. It
pleased them very well that one of householde with Jesus, should be the chief
worker of this mischief. They agreed of the sum of money that Judas should
have for his labor. And there was mutual faith found in that wicked
counsel, and conspiracy, which is seldom kept in honest and leafull
couenauntes. Judas believed the bare promise of the priests, without either
writing, witnesses, or sureties. He ymagined with himself which way he might
betraye Jesus unto the said priests, and Scribes after such a sort, as they
desired: that is to say, in time, and place convenient, lest any business
or insurreccion should rise hereof. For this condition was expressed in the
covenant. In the mean time, whiles Judas, and the hye priests counsayled
together how for to destroy him, Jesus went about the business of man's
salvation.

Now was the first day of the feast of sweet bread cum, on the which day
the Jews were wo^t to offer up their easter lamb. Therefore Jesus disciples
said unto him. Whither will thou that we go, and prepare thee thy easter
souper? Jesus sent out two of them to make provision therefore saying unto them:
Go ye into the city, and as soon as ye be entered in, there shall meet you a
man carrying a pitcher of water: him follow ye, and into what house soever he
enters in, say these words to the good man of the house in my name. The
master says, where is the soupyng chamber where I may eat my easter lamb
with my disciples? and he shall straightwayes show you a large souping
chamber, paued, and already prepared for the feast that shall be made therein.
There prepare you for us our easter souper. Here mark me the simple obedience
of the Apostles, such an obedience as they also showed before, when they were
sent out to fetch the Asses foale. Mark also this, that there is nothing hyd
and unknown unto the lord: so that it is manifest and plain hereby, that he
both foreknewe, and willyngly suffered whatsoever he suffered for our cause.
Further, mark his authority. At the naming of this word (Lord, or Master)
the ass was byanby let go. Again at the naming of the same word, the soupyng
chamber was furthwith showed them, so that it appears hereby, that it was in
his power to do whatsoever he would: he could with a beck have restrained the
priests, and phariseis, who went about cruelly to tourment him and put him to
death. The disciples went their way, and came into the city, and found one
carrying a water pitcher: whom they followed, and entered into the house where he
went in, and declared unto the goodman of the house, their masters
commandment. He without any tarying showed them a soupyng chamber, wherein the
disciples prepared their easter lamb, that is to say, the last and mystical
souper, which should both represent the figure of the old law, and also
sacramentally present and exhibit unto them, the sacrifyce of the new law,
and gospel.

In the euentyde Jesus followed with his twelve disciples, whom only as chosen
fellows, his pleasure was should be witnesses of all that should be done in
this most holy feast or maundye. When they were all set at the table, and
taking their repast, Jesus said unto them: I assure you that one of you that
eats with me, shall betraye me. As he had so said, eleven of them were
stryken with great sorrow and pensiveness. For there was none of them all that
knew himself fautie, save Judas only. But yet durst they not trust to the
weakness and frailty of man's nature. Therefore each of them desirous to be
delivered of this pensive carfulness by the lords discrying of the
traytoure, said unto him: Is it I? Neither was Judas, who knew himself
culpable, ashamed to say with the rest: Master am I he? Jesus to show unto
his disciples a perfect ensample of leuitie and meekness, thought it better
to suffer them a while to be troubled with heaviness, then to bewraye the
traytoure: vsyng all the ways and means he could, to cause him to return
from his wicked and mischievous purpose. Therefore he said: It shall be one of
the twelve, It is one of the twelve, etc.
who is so familiare with me, that he dippeth in the same platter that I do.
And this is the reward which he will give me for my gentle and familiar
entertainment. Now Judas perceived that it was not unknown unto the lord
where aboutes he went: and he saw also such meekness in him, as the like had
not been heard of before. Jesus would not discrie him (of who^ he should anon
after be most falsely betrayed unto death) unto the residewe of his disciples,
because they would peradventure if the treason had been opened, have cruelly
handled him for their masters sake. But oh incurable malice. What stone, what
diamo^d, would not so great gentleness make to relent, specially of him who
could hurt and displease with a beck? But the same ge^tlenesse more encouraged
the wretch to do this wicked and mischievous deed. Then went Jesus forth with
his tale in this wise: howbeit as concerning me, nothing shall be done
otherwise then I will my self: but as the prophets have said and prophesied
of the son of man, so shall it be. It is expedient for a great many that he
be delivered and betrayed to death. But yet woe be to him through whose
malice and wickedness, But woe is that man.
he shall be betrayed. He procures a thing which shall be soul health to other,
and to himself utter confusion. It had been better for him that he had never been borne. Howbeit this wicked mind, and purpose of Judas, was never a whit
reformed, neither with so great meekness of the lord, nor yet for dread of
the great horrible punishmente which he threatened him withal: so great a
michiefe is covetousness.

Furthermore in this souper, Jesus commended unto his disciples that most holy
sacrement or sign of his death, and of the perpetual covenant made with
those that would continue in the eua^gelike and christian faith: for this cause
he took bread, and after thanks given to god the father, brake it, and gave it
to each of them, saying: Take, eat, this is my body. Also he took the cup, and
after thanks given, gave it them, and they all dra^ke thereof. Then he said
unto them. This is my blood of the new testament which shall be shed for many*
Be you well assured of this that I shall tell you: from henceforth I will drink
no more of the fruit of the vine till that day that I drink it new in the
kingdom of God. When the souper was done, and grace said in the laud and
praise of god, according to their manoure and custom, the same night they
departed from Jerusalem unto mount Oliuete. We must ever thank, and praise God
both in weal and woe. All ye shall be offended* etc.
There Jesus knowing the frailty and weakness of his disciples, prepared and
stre^gthned their minds, that they might be able to suffer the storm of
persecucion which hanged over their heads. All ye, says he, shall be troubled
this night for my cause. And this thing did Esaias also prophecy of before. I
will smite, says he, the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered abroad.
But despair ye not. As my death shall trouble you, and cause you to disperse
and scatter abroad, so shall my resurreccion recomfort you, and gather you
together again. For I will reliue, as I said, on the third day, and being
reliued, will go before you into Galile. After ye have there seen me, you shall
put away all sorrow and heuinesse. When Peter, who as yet knew not his own
weakness, heard him say so, he answered again very manfully, but yet rashely
withal, saying: Although all the residewe be offended with thy death, yet truly
will I not be troubled therewith a whit. Jesus desirous clean to wede and
pluck out of our minds all trust of our selves, says unto him: O Peter,
thou deniest that that thing shall be done, which both the prophets, and I my
self (whom it had been thy part to believe, and in no wise to gainsaye or
contrary with words) have told before shall cum to pass. O thou rash
promiser: Yea, the stronger thou thynkest thy self to be, the more notably
shall thou be troubled above all other. This thing I assure the of: before the
cock crow twice this same very night, thou shall thrice deny me. Yet is the
presumpcion of Peter nothing abated herewith, Before the cock crow twyse. etc.
insomuche that he makes a more stout, and greater promise of himself, then
he did before, saying: Yea, if there be no remedy, but I must needs even dye
with the, yet I will never deny the. As Peter said, so said the rest of the
disciples, to thentent that they erring together, should be all reformed
together of their error, and know how unable they were to do any thing by
their own strength and power, and finally perceive how it was not possible for
any thing to be vain or untrue, which came out of Christ's mouth. A little
before, they al agreed together in confessing truly who Christ was, and the
common opinion of them al was praised in Peter. Here they agree altogether in
a rash confidence and trust of themselves: and in Peter alone the rashenesse
of them all is rebuked. Only Peter denied Jesus, and the rest would have done
the like, if occasion had been given them so to do. For they would have denied
him, if they had not fled away. The bold stomach of Peter, the which was
more constaunt in him then in the other, brought him into this danger. None of
all these things chanced unto the disciples of any set malice, as it happened
to Judas, but only through man's imbecillitie and weakness. And therefore
Jesus used the obstinate wickedness of Judas, to our salvation: and would have
the weakness and frailty of his apostles diuersely declared, because to teach
all other by them, how no man should warrant himself ought to his own
strength, but whenever the storm of yuels and adversities aryseth, wholely
to hang upon the heavenly aid and socoure: which so much the more presently
helps man, as he distrusteth his own strength and power. The apostles
could not yet be reproved by word: but the time would cum when the
experience of the matier should at the length make them to know themselves.

will be done. Therefore they came into a place called Gethsemamy. This
Gethsemany is a valey lying at the foot of mount Oliuete. No man can mount up
to the cross of Jesus, unless he first cum down unto this valey: unless he
humble and abase himself by renouncyng of all the aids and socours of man's
pride and loftiness. Here commanded he the other eight to tarry, and taking
unto him three, that is to say, Peter, James, and John, gate him away not
far of, because he would give himself to prayer and contemplacion. Behold
here the engines, and artilerye of the gospel against the violence of
persecucions. There were two things in Jesus most contrary: that is to wete,
his divine majesty, the^ which there was nothing higher, or of more
excellency: and his humayne weakness, then which there was nothing more
vile, or of less reputacion. Because unto these three disciples he had given
before some taste of his highness and divine majesty, it was his will and
pleasure they should now be witnesses of his greatest abasyng of himself,
and humility: to thentent that in the same Christ, they should learn, both
what they ought to counterfayte and ensue, and also what to hope after. Here
nowhere appeared his face all shynyng, and glisteryng like the Sun: no where
his apparayle whyter then the snow: no where Moses and Hely co^munyng with
him: and to be short, My soul is heavy, eue^ unto the death
no where was heard the fathers voice as it was before, but as a man utterly
forsaken and destitute of all help and socoure, he began to be soore
troubled with fear, and dismayed with great anguish and agony of mind: for he
was a very natural man, and notably expressed in himself, what is wont to
chance unto those persons, who are nothing else but men, whenever any such
storm hangs over them. Neither did he cloak and dissemble the thing among
his friends. I thoroughly, said he, feel in my mind, sorrow and heuinesse
lykest unto death. He sought for comfort every where, and found none at all.
But yet is it a certain kind of solace and comfort, to complain unto our
fre^des of our calamity, though they will not help us. Therefore he commanded
also these three to tarry here, and watch. That done, he went forth a little,
and as one clean destitute of all worldly comfort, and utterly forlorn and
paste help (as touching man's help) fled unto the father for socoure: of whom
yet he should not byanby be eased of his grief. Wherefore he fell down flat
on the ground: and lying grouelyng, prayed the father, that (if it were
possible) the time of this battle might pass away. The nature of his body
feared the tourment, and death that was nigh hand. Abba father (said he). Thou
canste do all things: take away this cup from me, that I drink not thereof.
Nevertheless let that be done that thy will has decreed, which wylleth,
nothing but what is most expedient and best: and not as the weakness of this
body desires.

When he had thus prayed, he returned unto his three disciples whom he left
behind him and found them now sleping. And then called he Peter, who a little
before had made so stout a promise, saying: Simo^, slepest thou? Could thou
not watch as much as one hour with me? This time admits no sluggishenesse.
For he slepeth not that goes about to destroy us. Watch, and pray, lest ye
enter into temptacion, because ye shall be in ieopardy to be ouercomen
therewith, if it cum upon you when ye are nothing prepared. The peril is like
commune unto us all. I watch and pray for your health and safety: And again
he went aside. etc.
do you like wise watch, and pray as I do, that you may overcome with me.
The spirit is ready, and wyllyng, but the flesh is weak. The spirit must be
stayed and stablyshed with watchyng, and prayer, lest, the flesh have the
upper hand. When Jesus had thus spoken he went eftsoon to the place from
whence he came, and made his prayers unto the father, with like tenor of
words as he did before: desyring him, that he might not drink of the cup
which was at hand: and anon he returned to his disciples and found them again
slepyng. They napped in the beholding of his majesty, insomuch that Peter
wiste not what he said. In like manor do they here sleep in the beholding of
his infirmity and weakness, and know not well what answer to make him
rebukynge them. Jesus returned the third time from prayer unto his said
disciples: and the third time he found them a sleep. Both they and we had
perished, unless Jesus had watched, and prayed for us al. Therefore after they
were wakened, he rebuked them because he would by them stir up and awaken all
slewthfull persons. Sleep ye, said he, from henceforth, and take your reast.
You have slepte enough. The thing self will now waken you whether you will or
no. The very point, and momente of the time is already cumme. Lo, the son of man shall anon be betrayed, and delivered into their hands that are all set
on mischief. And immediatlye while he yet spoke etc
Rise up, and let us go mete them. For now the lord Jesus had by prayer made
himself strong in mind against the storm of affliccions that was at hand.
Neither showed he any time afterward any token of fear, or werines: but gave
us an ensample of most co^staunt and steadfast patience unto the last hour. He
had no sooner spoken these words, but Judas Iscarioth one of the number of the
twelve chosen disciples, and among them taken for the chief, was cum, and
with him a great bend of soldiers fensed with sweardes and staves, against
Jesus being without armor, and weaponlesse. Neither lacked there here
authority. The hie priests, scribes, and head men of the people, sent this
power. Here mark me (good reader) the notable conflicte of the euangelike and
christian godliness against feigned and counterfayte holiness. Thus is the
truth of the gospel daily assaulted: thus does it always ouercum and get
the victory. There is none meter to betraye it then he, who professing
himself to be a preacher and teacher of the same, teaches those things that
are of the flesh. There is much more ieopardie of false doctrine, then of the
swerdes and staves of soldiers, that are notorious and open misdoers. Yet did
not Judas well trust to his own strength and policy, when he should betraye
the lord. He joined unto him a great bend of soldiers well weaponed, and
besides them, the authority of both the states, that is to say, both of the
spiritualitie, and te^poralitie. And all these things did they in the night,
having awayted as well opportunity of place, as of time. There must needs be
most horrible darkness, where Jesus is bound, and taken. This was the power
of darkness: and Satan was suffered a while to seem to have vanquished and
ouercum Christ. What greater blindness could there be then to go about by
man's policy to betraye him, unto whom nothing is unknown? then with
swerdes, and staves to assault him, who with a beck can do what him lust?
Judas did not openly show himself to be the captain of this ungracious
compaignie, but gave them first a token, saying: whomsoever I kiss, the same
is Jesus: Lay ye hands upon him, and lead him charely, lest he escape from
you. The priests were well ware of this, that the money should not be
disbursed unless Jesus were in their hands and custody. Then began Judas to
go a pretty way before the soldiers, as though he had goen about sumwhat else:
but yet he went so before the^, that he was ever in their sight. And anon as he
was cu^ unto Jesus, he saluted and kyssed him, according unto his accustomed
manoure. Neither did Jesus here abate any part of his ientilnesse toward the
traitor. He only nipped him by the conscience, saying: My friend for what
intent art thou cumme? He knew right well how he would never turn from his
wickedness, and yet used he all the means that might be, And he tha^ be^rayed
him had given them etc.
to refourme him: teaching us hereby to use all the gentleness, and fair
means we can possible toward sinners, because we be uncertain whether they
will one day turn and cum to ame^dment. If they amend, then have we wun the
soul health of our euenchristen: if they amend not, yet shall not our gentle
demenure be unrewarded. A kiss is a sign of mutual love and charity.
Charity declares us to be the disciples of Jesus. Wherefore there is no greater
point of enmity, then a feigned kiss. Certes such a kiss do false prophets,
e^e^ in these days give unto Jesus, which under pretense of christian
godliness, serve their belyes, and seek after the praise of the world: and instead of the spiritual fredo^e, teach a very Iewishe religion. At the token
of this ve^^mous kiss, the soldiers laid hands on him, and bound him. The
disciples when they saw this rufflyng and business, waxed fumishe and angrye.
And now Peter clean forgettyng what ye Lord had told him before, thought
the time was cum wherein it should be his part to do sum worthy feate,
according as he had right couragiouslye and like a bold man promised to do. He
drew out his swearde, and struck the high bishops servant called Malchus,
because he more fierce then the rest, And one of them that ^^ode by* etc.
first hasted to lay hands on Jesus. Howbeit the Lord so ordered the stroke
of his right hand, that he did Malchus no other harm, save alonely cut of his
right ear: the which the same most gracious lord anon as he had rebuked his
disciple, restored again, and so made him amends for the hurt of this small
and daungerles wound. So beneficial was Jesus to all men, that we ought to be
ashamed to have, so much as a will or an entente to be revenged upon any man:
I will not say to hurt such, as has not deserved our displeasure.

Further, as Jesus will not be defended with any other aids, then with the
swerd of the gospel, the which pearceth to the innermost parts of men's
hearts, so was it his will that this armed company of soldiers should know that
he could not have been apprehended by any puissaunce or power of man, unless
he had both willinglye and wittingly put himself into their hands to be
taken. I was daily with you in the temple.
Therefore he turned him unto them, and said: sirs what ayleth you to cum out
hither to me at midnight, with sweardes and stanes, as unto a thief that would
stand at his defense with like weapon? I was daily at Jerusalem, not privily,
but openly where every body might see me: in the place where most haunt and
resort of people is, I mean in the temple: healyng sick folk, and teaching
the truth. I was ever weaponlesse, and accompanied but with a small number of
disciples, who were likewise without armor and weapon. Why did ye not there
take me? Surely you might have done it then with less business, if it had
been so decreed.

But this is your time: insomuche that you may by gods sufferaunce, do now
to me what ye lust. And that it should so be, the scriptures, which
ca^^notlye, have foreshewed many years since. When he had said ^o, there was
but who might first lay hands on him: and anon the disciples fearyng
themselves, forsook their lord, and ra^ne away, sum to one place, and (...)
to another. It is lawful for weak persons to fly, who are not as yet (...)
and able to suffer persecucion. Albeit there chances a time, when that to
fly, is nothing else, but to deny Christ. There must we not fly, but even of
our own accord hasten to dye. When that by thy death the Gospel takes more
disprofite, then commodity, then fly away, and hyde thy self. But when that
by the same, the gospel has much profit, and contrarily great disprofite
and hinderaunce, if thou avoid the danger thereof, then stick not to go and
mete the hangman. And there followed hi^ a certain young man
There was among the twelve, a certain young strypplyng y^ loved Jesus more
the^ the rest, and followed him being led with his arms bound like a captive or
prisoner: whose ba^e body was clothed with one finelynne^ garment only. Him
they knew, and took. But he cast of his lynnen vesture, and so escaped out of
their hands, saving his life by the loss of his garment. He that so flies
after the spiritual sense, flies happily. For what else is this body but the
vesture and garmente of the soul? As often as Satan layethe hand upon the
soul, pass not upon the linen garmente, and so save thy self, and escape
out of his danger. Now behold how theuangelike veri^ie is handeled after it
is betrayed of a wicked disciple. The eruell garrison of soldiers leads it
bound to the chief men of both the states, who are in a co^spiracie to
destroy it. First it is brought unto the highest priest. There is no more
mortal an enemy unto Jesus, then is a wicked Bishop. Now because the matters
should seem to be done with more authority, thither assembled all the
priests, Scribes and elders. This is the authority of this world, which is
in a conspiracy aganste poor, simple, and plain verity, but yet invincible
withal. All this while Peter's heart failed him not. Howbeit he followed Jesus a
loofe, and was now a cloked disciple: and no marvel, sith the time drew
nere, when he would deny him. For man's bold stomach is good for nothing else
of it self, but to make the sinner more outragiously to offend. Therefore he
preased into the palace of the highest priest, and there sat amidmo^g the
lewd and ungracious company of servants, and warmed himself by the fire,
as one that would be rather a beholder of the Lords passion, then a follower.

In the mean season such of the priests as were chief in dignity (among
whom as every one was higheste in authority, so was the same more wicked then
the other) and with them the residue of the counsel, lest they should have
seemed to be rather murderers, then auengers of heresye, and ungodliness,
sought for sum witness against Jesus, whereby they might put him to death. They
desired nothing else, but his death and destruction, who freelye offered all men
life everlasting. Yet could there no mete witness be found. Jesus only was
he, against whom man's craftines could find no convenient witness For now
there came in many before the Judges, For ma^^ bare false witness.
who deposed against him, but their witness was so simple and sle^der, that it
appeared not to those most unjust fellows themselves, sufficient to condemn
him, whom they had in very deed condemned already among themselves, before
he was brought unto his arraignement. At the length there rose up certain
persons who gave sore evidence against him, saying: we will denounce unto you,
such things as we know certainly to be true. For we heard him say (with
these ears) I will destroy this temple made by man's hands, and after three
days expired, I will build another, But yet their witnesses.
that shall not be made with the hands of man. They would that this saying
should appear to be a blasphemye spoken against the Lords temple. Yet did
not their witness (albeit to aggrauate the haynousnes of the crime, it
contained sum truth) seem lawful and sufficient. A man would have said, that
the judges had taken conscience in the matter, and favored the defendaunte:
Howbeit this diligence of the priests was for nothing else, but because Jesus
should not by any means be quit and escape this judgment.

Yet all this while is there nothing done against him. There needs the help
of the highest priest or bishop of all, to destroy Jesus. He therefore
perceiving that the matter went but easily forward, rose up in the mids of
the counsel, and began to speak unto Jesus, sekyng sum occasion of his words,
whereby he might condemn him. Hear thou, says he, what crimes are laid
unto thy charge? Haste thou no answer to make hereunto? Jesus held his peace
and gave him not a word to answer. For, for what purpose should he have
answered to those things, which themselves judged but light matters, and of no
wayght? Therefore the highest Bishop still sought occasion, and questioned
with him, saying: Art thou that selfsame Christ the son of God, who is ever
to be praised? Jesus confessed he was. For it was not his part to deny that
thing, which it behooved all men to know.

And because he knew they would not believe in him, or at the leastwise would
contemn him, by reason of the weakness of his body: he added an other
sentence to fear them withal. You shall see (quod he) the son of man
sitting on the right hand of the divine majesty, and cummyng on high in the
clouds of heaven, with great glory, and many angels waytyng upon him. He
meant of his second cumming: when he will return, not likewise low as he
was then, but in divine majesty a judge both of the quick, and dead. The
wicked priests were ignorant in the law: yet might they have learned of the
Phariseis, that both the cumminges of Messiah, were prophesied of by the
prophets: the one not regarded and passed on, the other royal, and dreadful.
But they had no leisure to compare Jesus deeds, with the prophecies, and
foresayinges of the prophets. All that ever they went about was nothing else,
but to bring him to destruction. Here the highest priest clokyng his
wickedness with a vysure of Godliness, Then the hye priest re^t his cl^thes.
rent and tare his clothes thereby to make the blasphemy to appear more heinous
and detestable.

What needs there, says he, any further witness: yourselues have heard an
open blasphemy. The wicked Bishop desirous to set forth his own glory, could
not abide to hear Christ's glory advanced: supposyng that what glory and
praise soever had been given to Christ, the same should have been to the great
derogacion and minishyng of his majesty. ^oodnesse caused him a little before
to rise out of his place: and yet in so doing, he gave reverence unto the son
of god. Now does he rent his clothes, prophesying hereby, how it shall cum to
pass, that the true bishop reigning the carnal and figurative bishophode
shall be clean abolished and set aside. The glorious sinagoge was rent, but
Christ's coat remains still whole. What is farther from blasphemy, then to
set forth the glory of the son of God? then to testify that all shall come
to pass, whatsoever the Prophets have prophesied to cum? And yet the
ungracious bishop judges this to be such a blasphemye, as needs no
witnesses. What, says he, think you here in? All they with one consent gave
judgment that this saying was an offense worthy of death. Forsothe a mete and
a worthy council for such a priest. Now is it to be considered how
theuangelyke verity is entreated in such councels, where as a wicked priest,
who feign would be taken for a god, What think ye* etc.
cannot abide to have the glory of the son of god auaunced: where the
Scribes do not utter what they have learned of the prophets: where the head
men, and elders of the people, be in a conspiracy with the chief prelates of
the temple: where such waged servants, and hired soldiers bear a stroke,
as are of their own naughty disposicion inclined to all mischief. For now
some of them began to spitte at Jesus, as though he had been lawfully
condemned: and other some covered his face with a veil, and after they had
buffeted him, said: Prophecy, and arrade who has stricken the. Thus they
reprochefully scorned him, because he suffered the people to take him for a
prophet. Furthermore the priests servants did likewise beat and buffet him.
These things were more fell, and cruel then death: but this ensample was
ordained for our enstruccion. In sufferyng of reproach and vylany none passed
Jesus: but in workyng of miracles there were some, that went beyond him

While all these things were done unto Jesus, Peter being a fearful beholder,
sat in the neither part of the palace among the wicked bishop servants. For
there was a convenient place for him, sith he would deny Jesus. Hither came
a certain wenche of ye highest priest, which, after she had espied him
warmyng himself with other by the fire, and hadiyed him diligently, began to
know his shape and phisnamie, and said unto him: Yea thou too wast with Jesus
of Nazareth. Peter frayed with these words denied it saying: I know not the
man, nor wot not what thou meanest. It was conueniente that this stout
promiser, because he might the better know his own frailty, should be made
afearde of a wenche, to thentent that he afterward boldly professyng the name
of Jesus before rulers, and princes, should know that his boldness and
constant courage of mind, came not of man's strength, but of the holy ghost.
He therefore being now afearde, and half mistrustyng that place, gate him out
of the hall. Yet departed he not out of the bishops palace. Whiles he abode
here, the cock crewe. Peter heard that, and yet remembered not what Jesus had
told him: so greatly was he afraid. Then a certain damsel (when she saw
him) began to detect him again to them that stood about her, saying: This is
one of their number. Peter eftsoon avoided her saying with a lie, denying flat
that he was any of the apostles. And anon after when the servants which
stood by whiles the damsel knew and discryed him, had themselves well vewed
his favor and appara^le, they likewise began to know him, and said: Uerily
thou art one of them. For thou art of Galile. The first that detected him
was a woman. Oh what a peril it is for Christ's disciple to be known in
bishops, and princes courts? Unless he utterly deny himself to be Christ's
disciple, he stands in ieopardie to lose his life. Peter is also in
ieopardie, by reason of his mother tongue and country language. Such manor
of courts can abide no sincere and pure verity. Now shall Peter at the
length, be made a right courtier up and down. For he begins to swear
depely, Peter remembered the word.
and to curse withal, that he never in all his life time knew this Jesus, who^
they spoke of. And as he had spoken the word, the cock crewe again. Peter
came not to himself again, before Jesus looked upon him. Therefore at the length
calling to his remembrance the words that Jesus had spoken unto him, when he
said: before the cock crow twice, thou shall thryse deny me: he went forth
of Cayphas house, and braste out a weeping. Yet went he not to hang himself, as
Judas did, because he fell not of obstinate iuelnesse, but by man's frailty
and weakness, and that by the sufferau^ce of God, because his fall should be
our instruccio^. But this shower of tears which braste out of his iyes,
quenched the lyghtning of Gods wrath and anger. He wept not before he was
goen out of Caiphas palace. For there the more naughty pack that every one
is, the more he estemeth and favors himself.

The.xv. Chapter.

AL ye night was spent in Cayphas house, in destroying, mockyng, and skorning
of Jesus. In the morning earlye after they had cou^sayled together afreshe, the
hie priests, with the elders Scribes, and all the whole assembly, led him
away with his arms bound, and delivered him unto Pylate to be judged: who^
they had with their foreiudgement already condemned. Now are they of judges
becum accusars. Pylate, their accusacions and complaints heard, called Jesus,
and asked him: Art thou thatsame king of the Jews? Jesus answered. Thou
say: couertlye knowledgyng and confessyng that he was the selfsame. Yet was
Pilate not a whit moved with this answer, because there appeared nothing in
him whereby he seemed desirous of any worldly kingdom. Furthermore the hye
priests, lest he should by any means have been quit, gathered together
diverse criminal artycles against him, to the^tent that amongst many matters,
there should at ye least wise be sum thing in fine which would move any judge,
not being to unjust, and parcyall, to give sentence against him. And Pilate
asked him again.
Pylate perceiving how all was done of private displeasure and malice, sought
occasion to discharge him of such matters as he was arrayned for. Therefore
when he came again unto Jesus, and Jesus would give him never a word to
ausw^re, the^ said he unto him: Make thou no answer, since thou art in so
great danger to lose thy life? Se how many artycles these fellows lay against
the. Jesus from thenceforthe made no answer, who desired not to escape this
judgment, lest the utility of his death, should have been let or hyndered
thereby, and also because he knew right well that ye malice of the priests
would not yet have ceased, although they had not this way prevailed against
him. For this cause his will and pleasure was so to dye, that it might appear
that he died willyngly. The Emperors deputy, albeit he were a paynim, yet did
he abhor the murdering of a man, whom he judged to be an innocent and
gyltlesse person: and therefore used he all the ways and means he could
possible to deliver him. For he saw well there was no healpe to be had on his
behalf, whereby he might so do.

There was a custom among the Jews that at the feast of Easter, one of them
should be lewsed which lay in prison for any death worthy offense,
whomsoever the Jews desired to be given unto them. At that season there was
induraunce a certain notable felo^, much spoken of for his ungracious deeds,
named Barrabas, who had been a stirrer up of sedicion in the city, and in the
busynes, and hurly burly that he made, had committed manslaughter. Pylate
determined with himself to use this occasion to save Jesus. Therefore when the
people were cummen together, according to their ancient custom to desire to
have some felon pardoned, in token of their safe deliverance and scapyng out
of Egypt, Pylate answered in this wise: I have two prisoners, Barrabas whom
ye know, and Jesus who^ men call the king of the Jews.

Will ye therefore that I lewse unto you Jesus? Pylate perceiving that he could
have no aid and help of the priests, went unto the people because to have
had some aid and assistence of them, trusting that by their favor, Jesus
should have been delivered. And so had he been without fail, if the malicious
bishops (never weary to work mischief) had not moved them rather to desire to
have Barrabas pardoned, then Jesus.

whom ye call the king of the Jews? And they cried again: crucify him.
Pilate said unto them: what evil has he da^^? and they cried the more
fervently: Crucify him. And so Pylate wyllyng to content the people, let lose
Barabas unto them, and delivered by Jesus (when he had scourged him) for to be
crucified. When this thing had so chanced, contrary to the deputies
expectation (for he heard say that Christ was highly in grace and favor with
the people) yet ceased not he to help him, And they brought him to a place
named Golgotha. etc.
as much as in him lay. What then, said he, will ye that I do with the king
of the Jews loking to have heard of them a more favorable and gentler
sent^nce. But here the wylye Bishops were very circumspect, who had before
hand infected the minds of the comminaltie with their wickedness. Neither is
the authority of such bishops good for any thing else, but to move Princes,
and the people against the truth of the gospel. The people therefore cried
again: crucify him. The bishops had also beaten into their heads, that the
shamefullest kind of death of al, should be chosen out for him: because his
name should hereby be counted detestable and cursed among all the Jews.

For the law pronounced him cursed, whosoever hanged in wood. So studied they not
only to bereave him of his life, but also utterly to extincte and abolyshe his
good name, which was a fact much crueller then death. They could not abide
that any man's name should be counted holy, save theyrs. Neither did Pilate
here yield unto their fury, but spoke har^e against them, saying: I am the
Emperors deputy. It is not lawful for me to put any man to death, unless he
be duly convicted. What offense has he dooen wherefore he ought to be
crucified? Here the deputy nothing prevailed. For they cried outemore
^uriously: Crucify him. Yet for all that Pylate shranke not in Christ's cause,
till they laid unto his charge treason against the Emperor. It was not
convenient that Jesus should be done to death, except the Emperors authority
had served the fury of the bishops. Pylate perceyuyng what danger hanged over
his head, on the one side, of the Emperor, on the other, of the clamarous
people, albeit he knew right well that Jesus was an innocente and harmeles
person, yet willinge to yield and conform himself to the mortal hatred of
the bishops, Scrybes, elders, and people, gave sentence of death against him:
but with the same ^entence he both cleared the innocent of all crimes, and also
condemned the priests, and the people. For he pronounced him to be innocent
and giltles, whom he let them have to crucify. Such manner of Pylates shall
the truth of the gospel evermore have: and would to God there did not arise
among us some bishops, which are far beyond those bishops in all mischief
and ungraciousness. When therefore Jesus was condemned to death, he was first
beaten with scourges. But when the Jews were not here with satisfied, Pylate
delivered him to the garrison of ye soldiers to be crucified. So it pleased the
high wisdom of God that Jesus the fountain of al glory, should be put to all
kinds of vilany, by all sorts of people: to the intent we should not be
dismaide with any mane^ of worldly evils or adversities. Judas betrayed him: the
bishops, Scribes, and headmen of the people counseled together: the servants
took him: Cayphas the highest priest, chief worker of all this mischief
condemned him: the Council, and their servants scorned him as a condemned
person: the people cried out against him like mad folks: the Emperors name
makes the judge afraid: Herod despises: the Emperors deputy gives
sentence: and in all these is Cayphas, and in him the devil.

And the soldiers led him away into the common hall, and called together the
who^e ^ultitude, and they clothed him with purple, and they platted a croune of
thorns, and croun^^ him withal, and began to salute him: hayle king of the
Jews. And they smote him on the head with a read, and did spit upon him, and
bowed their knees, and wor^^ypped him. Now remains there behind, that the
wicked garrison of soldiers do likewise play their parts, and among the^ also
was Cayphas. All the shame and villainy that Jesus was put unto, all his
destruction (if it may be said yt he was destroyed) came of Caiphas, who
unawares wrought a thing most blessed and holy. For he made this sacrifice,
without which no man could have attained salvation. When therefore Jesus was
cast and judged to dye, Pylates servants led him into the hall of the
palace. For the Jews, who were desirous to seem holy durst not enter into the
palace of Panim; because they would come pure and clean to celebrate their
passover.

And yet was their minds in the mids of the palace, and in the very hands
of the soldiers, whom being of their own enclinacion ready to do all
mischief, they provoked and incensed thereunto. After Pylate had once delivered
his hands of Jesus, he thought it made no great force how he were done to
death. So did Herod favor the virtue, and goodness of John, that at the
request of a peuishe wenche he caused his head to be stricken of. Howbeit the
favor of Pylate was more constant then so, but yet in conclusyon he delivered
him to be crucified. And this was done lest any that professes the truth of
the gospel, should trust upon any worldly aid and succor. Then the
soldiers, because they would the more take their pleasure on him in puttyng
him to shame and villainy, called together the whole garrison of their
companions: and in m^^kage, clothed him with a garment of purple, as it had
been with a kings robe: the^ put they on his head a croune platted of thorns,
in the stead of a diadem, and being thus disguised, they began with one voice
to salute him, saying: Hayle king of the Jews. Furthermore they struck his
head with a read, which they gave him in his hand in ye stead of a scepter:
and did also spit upon him, and bowyng their knees, wurshypped him. Jesus all
this while held his peace, and patiently yielded to al their dispitefull
doings, transportyng unto his own person that shame and villanye, which was
due unto our offenses, because to advance us unto his glory.

These things done, they took of again the purple garment, and put on his
own clothes to the^tent that carrying his cross among misdoers, he might be
discerned, and known of every body. And this the malycious priests caused to
be done, because they would the more ali^nate and withdraw all me^nes minds
from him. As they were going to the place of execucion, they met a certain
fellow called Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander, and Rufus) cu^myng from
his ferme: whom making refusal to bear Christ's cross, the soldiers
(notwithstanding he was a rich man and of their acquaintance) did of a
souldiourly malapertnes compel maugre on his head to bear it: not because to
favor or ease Jesus, but for the spedier finishyng of the execucion. Some men
necessity constrayneth to embrace the cross of Jesus: But this is a blessed
necessity that drives a man to salvation. The apostles enforce no man to go
to Christ: but the soldiers used compulsion. Howbeit the violence of these
naughty packes has been many a man's salvation. They brought him into a
place slanderous and reprocheful, And they brought him to a place named
Golgotha, etc.
by reason that such as trespaced the law, there suffered execucion: called in
the Syrian tongue, Golgotha, and in Latin Caluaria, the which word implies in
English a place of dead men's sculles. There gave they him wine mingled with
myrre, to drink. For wine is customablie given to men, when they be a passing.
Howbeit that wine, for so much as it was corrupted with the bitterness of the
Jews, Jesus received not when it was offered him. For a little before he drank
with his disciples, and would not drink again of the fruit of the vine, till
he should drink it new in the kingdom of God. He hated the bitter wine
which the vine of the Iewyshe synagoge brought him forth, that was becum
bitter unto her lord, and tiller: and instead of ripe grapes, yielded the
fruit of the wild vine. He hated the vine of wicked persons, and thirsted for
another kind of wine. That was the new wine of the spirit of the Gospel,
the which spirit after his ascending up into heaven, he most plenteously
powered upon his disciples.

When Jesus was lifted up on the cross, those that crucified him, parted his
clothes among the^: and for his coat (which was wrought in such wise yt it
could not be divided) they cast lottes, whose fortune it should be to have
the whole. Now considre the poverty of Jesus, who had nothing left him in
earth. He hangs in the mids between heaven and earth. So must he be
naked: so must he be lyghted of all burdens: so must he be high, that will
encountre with the enemy of man's salvation. When David should fight with
Goliad, he cast away all the armor and weapon of Saul, whi^he did rather
burden him, then do him any stead. It was the third hour of the day when
they nailed him on the cross. There was set upon the cross the title of the
cause wherefore he suffered, which was this: The king of the Jews: written in
three languages, that is to say, in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. And with him
they crucified two thieves, in such wise that one of them hong on his right
side, and the other on his left, on either side enuironing him hangyng in the
mids. And this was done by the procurement of the wicked priests, because to
make his name shameful. The prophet Esai prophesied it should so be, saying:
He was reckened among the unjust and wicked.

Neither could the malicious bishops, and Scribes yet be satisfied with these
so great euyls and manyfold displeasures. For first the Jews passing by the
cross, rayled on him as he hong thereon: and as it were vpbraydyng him now
ouercum, said unto him in derision and mockage waggyng their heads withal: A
wretch, thou that destroyest Gods temple, and buildeste it again within three
days: Now show what thou canste do: Put furthe this might and power
whereupon thou braggest: save thyselfe if thou be able and cum down from the
cross. Neither did the high bishops or priests use any gentler language unto
him, who with the Scribes skorned him among themselves, saying: He has saved
other, but himself he is not able to save: He has made his vaunt how he was
Christ: he bragged that he was the king of Israel. If his promises be true,
let us see him ^owe cum down from the cross, and then will we believe o^n him.
The priests intended by these reproachful words, clean to withdraw all men
from the belief of Jesus. So are the Martyrs even at this day often times
scorned, and with like reprocheful words rayled on in their martyrdom, and
corporal tourmentes, so is the verity of the gospel verated, and laughed to
skorne of the miscreantes, which is many times so hardly handled, that it
seems to be utterly oppressed. Yet ceased not this outrageous raylyng against
Jesus. The two thieves that were crucified with him, rebuked the innocent as they
honge on the cross. But here also did Jesus according unto his name. For he
saved one of them.

At the sixte hour there arose a darkness, which covered all that land: and
endured till the nynth. Then Jesus destitute of all man's help, cried unto
the father with a loud voice, reciting out of the psalm the prophecy which
was spoken of him before: Heloi, Heloi, Lamazabathany, the which words
interpreted, areas much to say in English, as, my God, my God, why have thou
forsaken me? When some of them that stood by heard him speak these words, and
understood not well the Hebrew tongue, they said: he calls upon Hely. There be
many such false prophets, and interpreters of scripture, even in our time,
and ever shall be till the worlds end, which expound the words of Jesus, no
better then those scorners did. After that when he cried again: I am a thyrst:
there ran one unto him, and ^aught him a sponge full of vinegar, fastened to a
read, saying: Let him alone: let us see whether Hely will cu^ and take him down
from the cross. When he had eftsoon tasted the vinegar, he would not drink
thereof. He thyrsted another wine, which they would not give him, that refused
to believe the gospel.

Jesus (all things fulfilled) gave a great skryke, and therewith yielded up the
ghost. And byanby the veil of the temple which disseuered those things that
the Jews counted most holy from the sight of the multitude or common people,
was rent from the vppermoste part to the lowest. Shadows cease, and vanishe
away, as soon as verity cummeth once to light. Neither should it be any more
needful for any priest to enter into the sanctuary, after that sacrifice was
once offered up, and made: which alone was sufficient to pourge the sins of
the whole world. Now when the captain that stood right against Jesus, as a
minister, and witness of his death, who had seen many a one before put to
execucion, saw how that contrary to the manoure of other, he yielded up the
ghost and dyed immediatlye as he had given this great skrike, he said: Truly
this man was the son of God.

See here the first fruits of the gentiles, confessing the virtue, and power
of Christ. He that confesses him to be a man, and the son of God:
confesses him to be both God and manne. Albeit the captain as yet understood
by the son of God, a man notably beloved of God. Mark this also, how our
savior is every where a savior. When he was a dying on the cross, he saved
one of the thieves. And anon as he was dead, he drew the captain unto the
profession of Christen faith. There were also women that stood a good way of
and beheld all that was done: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the
mother of James the less, and of Ioses: and Mary Salome, the which all the
while that Jesus continued and taught in Galile, followed him, and ministered
unto him of their substance: and besides these, diverse other, which likewise
followed him in his voyage to Jerusalem.

When the euentyde drew nigh, forasmuch as it was the preparing day, so
called, because it was the eue^ of the great Sabbath: there came one Joseph of
the city of Aramathia, a noble, and a right worthy senatoure, who likewise
hoped after the kyndome of God. This man because he had a good opinion of Jesus:
was bold through affia^nce of his nobility, to go unto Pilate and desire of
him the body of Jesus. Pilate meruayled if Jesus being but a young man, were
already dead: because many had been wont to live two or three days after
their legs were broken.

Therefore he called unto him the Captain, who stodeby the cross, and
demanded of him whether he were all ready dead, or no? And when by his
informacion he was well ascerteined that he was d^ad in very deed, he gave the
body to Joseph. For Jesus as long as he lived, suffered himself to be beaten
and spit upon of wicked persons. But anon as he was dead, he claymed his
dignity, and would not be handled but of godly persons, no not somuche as be
seen but of his disciples, who were appointed to life everlasting: teaching
thereby, that no man should challenge his dignity in this world. Let a man
by honor, and dishonor, by glory, and reproach, only endeavor himself to
finishe the business of the gospel. For dignity begins never to floryshe
till after death. Joseph being right joyful that he had obtained so precious
a gift, bought a piece of fine linen clothe, and therein wrapped the body,
and laid it in a new sepulcher hewed out of free stoone: and then rolled a
great stone to the door or entry of the sepulcher, that no man should lightly
convey away the body by stealth.

But of the women which beheld the lord when he dyed, two followed him unto
the sepulcher: that is to wete, Mary Magdalene, and Mary Joseph, markyng where
the body was laid, to thentent that they might at time convenient thither
repair, and honorably perform the solemnities, and ceremonies belonging unto
burials, according to the manor and usage of that nation.

The.xvj. Chapter.

BEcause that on the preparyng day (on the which day the lord was buried a
little before the euentide, immediately after the Sun setting) it was not
lawful to do any work for the reverence, and high solemnity of the Sabbath:
these women ceased for that time to make further provision for spices, as they
began to do, awaytyng for the end of the next day following. And anon as the
Sun was gone to glade, and the time come again when men might lawfully
return to their business, then came Mary Magdalene, Mary of James, and
Salome, with spices ready prepared, to enoint Jesus. And early in the morning
upon the first day of the sabbothes (the which followed next after the
sabbath was ended, and was the third day from the preparing day) these well
disposed women came to the sepulcher, what time the element waxed now fair and
bright about the Sun rising, and said one of them to another: Who shall
roll us away the stone, from the door of the sepulcher? The stone was great,
and houge: and it passed woman's strength to remove it. And they looked about if
they could get any body to help them, and in ye mean while that they thus
looked back, they saw the stone already removed to their hands. The^ anon as
they were entered into the door of the sepulcher, they saw a young man sitting
on the right side of it, clothed with a long white garment. With this sight
though it were a right joyful sight, and a token of good luck, yet because it
appeared suddenly, and at unawares, they were amassed.

But byanby an Angel recomforted them with sweet and pleasant words,
saying: you have no need to be afraid. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was
nailed on the cross. He is risen: he is not here. Behold the void place
where they had put his body. Therefore all this that you have prepared to honor
and reverence him with all, is superfluous.

Get you hence rather, to show unto his disciples, being greatly dismayed with
their Lords death: but especially unto Peter (who because he denied him
thryse, is twyse as sorry as the rest.) Get you hence, I say, to show them how
Jesus will go before them into Galile. Thither let them follow. There shall you
see him alive, whom ye now bewail as dead. But these women, what for great
joy and gladness, and what for the fear they were in by reason of this
strange sight fled out of the Sepulcher, and spoke not one word as long as
they were there: so greatly were they afearde.

As yet Jesus had not appeared to any body: but after he was risen, he
appeared first of all to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven
devils: and this appering was the first day after the great Sabbath early.
She incontinent showed the disciples (who wept and mourned for their lords
death,) what she had seen. But when they heard her tell how he was alive, and
that she herself had seen him, and heard him speak, they gave no credence
unto her words. So clean out of memory was the thing which he had so often
times promised, that is to say, how he would rise again on the third day.
The same day that he appeared unto Mary Magdalene, he appeared also unto two
disciples in the likeness of a stranger and wayfaryng man as they went from
Jerusalem into the country. But they knowing at the length that it was the
Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and showed unto the resydew of the disciples,
what they had seen. Neither was such things as they told, believed of the
most part.

Last of all when he was ready to depart hence, and return into heaven, he
appeared unto the eleven Apostles as they sat at meat (for Judas was then
dead) and hit them in the teeth with their unbelief, and hardenesse of heart,
because they would not believe those persons, who had seen that he was risen
again from death. For it was not requisite that all should se his death, and
resurreccion, but sufficient for the faith and certainty of the gospel, that
the thing was ^nce proved by mete and convenient witnesses: Else how shall the
heathen give credence to those things that were done, if they would likewise
discredit the apostles report, as Thomas, and some other of them did at the
beginning. And Jesus said unto them. After all those things are now at the
length proved, and right well known of you by sure arguments and profes: go
your way into all the world, and preach this gospel to all the nations
thereof. He that believes and is baptized shall be saved
For I dyed for all men, and likewise for all men have I risen again. It is
not now needful to keep the ceremonies of the old law. It is not needful
to use any mo sacrifices, and burnt offeringes to pourge sins. Whosoever believes
the gospel (which through my death offreth to all that believe in me, free
remission of all sins) and being washed with water, receives a sign or
token of this grace, the same shall be saved.

Who so believes not the gospel (there is not why he should trust to the
obseruacion of Moses law, or heathen learning and philosophy,) the same
shall be damned. This way is open for every manne to go to salvation by: but it
is but one way only.

And lest your preaching should not be believed, there shall be joined thereunto
a power to work miracles: so that there lack not in you an Euangelike faith:
In my name shall they cast out devils.
and so that the thing self do require miracles. The chief power and virtue
of the Euangelyke grace, lies hyd in men's souls: but yet when for the
aduauncyng of the gospel there shall need any miracles, the same shall not
lack for the weakes sake. They that will believe in me, shall cast out devils,
not in their own name, but in mine: they shall further, speak with new
tongues, and drive away serpents: and if they drink any deadly thing or
poison, it shall not anoye them. They shall lay their hands upon the sick,
and they shall be whole. When these things are wrought and done in men's
souls, then is there a much greater miracle wrought, but the same is hid and
not seen. Covetousness, pleasure of the body, ambicion, hatred, wrath and
envy, be very poisons and deadly diseases of the soul. These diseases shall
they cure and put away in my name, and that continually. But for the weakes
sake, and such as are hard of belief, the other miracles shall also be often
times wrought, to thentent the gross sort of people may perceive, that in my
disciples is a spirit more puissaunte, then all man's strength and power.

When the Lord Jesus had spoken these, and other mo words to his disciples,
he ascended up into heaven, where he sits on the right hand of god the
father. The disciples after they had received the holy ghost, preached as they
were commanded, not only in Iewry, but also in all other regions and
countries: and the matier went forward, notwithstanding the world resisted,
and was bent against them: the Lord Jesus puttyng furthe his mighty power by
his holy spirit, and their ministry: and euerywhere confirmyng with ready
miracles, whatsoever they promised to do with words.

FINIS.
To the most virtuous Lady and most gracious Queen Katerine, wife unto the
most victorious and most noble prince Henry the.viii. King of England,
France, and Irelande. etc. Nicolas Udall wishes prosperous health, and long
continuance, with grace, peace, and all ghostely coumforte in our Lord Jesus
Christ.
Like as our master Christ in the gospel, most gracious Queen Katerine,
when the woman that had lived wickedly, being now by his grace called from her
sinful life to perfect repentance and amendme^t, came unto him sittyng at
his repastein the house of Simon the lepre, and washed his feet with the
tears of her iyes wyped the same with yt hear of her head, poured forth upon
his head a precious sweet ointment, and also anointed his feet therewith, did
so well allow her devotion, her earnest zele, and her tender compassion which
she had to ^oumfor^ him, that he did not only among all the cumpany declare
her present ^^mfort in forgeuyng her even there all her offenses and wickedness
before paste, but also promised that she should not lose the condign reward of
renoume for her te^dre gentilnes to him showed, in so much that before all the
presence he openly protested, that wheresoever throughout all the world the
gospel were afterward preached, there should she in such wise at al occasions
he had in mind, that the remembrance of her good heart and thankefulnes
toward him, should never dye nor be forgotten. So Luke the evangelist; and
Paul with the other apostles of Christ did in their holy writings, not only
make me^cio^ of suc^ men and preachers, as were faithful workers or ministers
in Christ's vyneyard, but also by whatsoever good matrones and devout women
they saw and found either that god was glorified and his honor ad^au^ced, or
ye gospel preferred, the word of god furthered* the preachers of the same
maintained, the yonglinges in the faith cherished, the true chri^^ia^s in their
poverty refreshed, the need of the faithful releued, or the vnf^^^ed beleuers
in adversities comforted and succored: to such godly women they did not
forget ne let pass to give loud, praise, and commendation, as well for the due
reward of the parties selves, as also for the good ensau^^le and encouragyng of
others to do the like. For this cause does Luke in his gospel more the^ once
make mention of Marie Magdalene, of Ioha^na, the wife of Chusa, of Susa^na, and
Marie the mother of James. And in the acts he neither forgets ne omitteth
to commend Priscilla, Tabitha, Lydia, Damaris. For this consideracion Paul
co^me^deth unto the Romans, Phoebe, Marie, Eryphena, Tryphosa, Persis and
others. For this respect did Hierome wait a whole treatise entytled of noble
and famous weme^, whose nobility and also renoume he estemeth and measures by
none other thing, but by their godliness, deuocio^, zele, and endeavor to
setforth Christ's holy gospel, and by their godly conversation joined with
most studious diligence in readyng the scriptures. Wherefore most gracious
lady, although here now to renew the memory and praise of the manifold most
excellent virtues, and ardent zele of your highness toward the promotyng of
the knowelage of gods holy word and gospel, be a thing more due to your
most worthy de^er^es, than easy for my rude pen to express them, and more
apperteineth to my duty, then it stands with mine ability and power
accordingly to set them forth: yet so to do at this present I have thought
partly a thing nedelesse: because your excellency does so far s^^^ounte
and pass all praises which my slendre vtteraunce is hable to give you, that I
should therein seem to do a much like thing, as if I would bring forth a
smouldring smokie fyerbrand in a bright sunnie day, of purpose to help augment
the clerenes of the sun: and partly super^luous, because that on the one side
all men do already know your incomparable virtues, and do with one accord
magnify the same, and on the other side, for yt your highness does so much
te^dre and seek gods glory that ye evidently declare yourself nothing less to
mind or desire, the^ the vain praises or commendacion of this world. Yet
like as the shadow does remediless follow and accumpanie the body in the
sun light, so glory and renoume does ineuitably follow and associate
excellent virtue. And where the deserts of true virtue are so great and so
just, it cannot be chosen but that glory and renoume must arise, and so much
the more, because your highness, (as much as in you lies,) does flee it. For
glory (says the phylosophical p^isee,) is of the nature of a Crocodile,
which being a beast in the flood of Nilus in Egypt, has this property, that
if one pursue him to suppress him, he flees and will not a^ide: and if ye
flee, than will the Crocodile follow and overtake you. And forasmuch as glory
is by the ph^losoph^ers d^^^ined to (...) constaunt and perpetual praise given
to any party by a common consent of good people, for ^he excellency of virtue
evidently showing it self in the (...) party, (as in deed virtue cannot be
hidden but will appear) how ca^ it be possible that your renoume should dye,
whose manifold excellent virtues do from day to day more and more increase?
How can your praise de^^y, whose arts and monumentes are consecrated to
immortality, as things not builded upon the sand of ambicious fekyng nor
(like bubles in the rain water) puffed up with a^ vnce^tain blast of worldly
vanity, but founded upon the sure rock o^ Gods word, from whence issues the
lyuelye and the same everlasting fountayn of true glory in deed? Neither may
your highness in this case refuse any man's words of praise and
commendacion, for as much as it is a matter as l^^dable to a^knowelage the
good things, which in deed are in us praise worthy, as it is vncomme^dable
through vain arrogancy to take up on us that we have not. And though your
grace is so far from all ambicion and also affec^ion of this worlds reward,
that ye have no iye to any mortal man's recompense, yet cannot good folks
but extolle and magnifye the inestimable noumbre of divine gifts of grace, so
plentiousely heaped and couched in so noble a Princess. Though ye would have
your well doings, hydden and unspoken of, yet cannot the gratitude of the
people hold the peace, or pass it with silence. Though your gracious
benignity require no thanks, yet cannot the honest hertes of the people
forbear or refrain by open protestacion to acknowelage by whom they daily
receive incomparable benefits. Though your modesty nothing less seeks then
the fame of your good acts to be blown abroad, yet cannot our duties but
brast out into words of testifiyng how much we think our selves bound unto
your highness: so that although the great and manifold benefytes which I have
privately received at your graces hands, did not now move me, yet could I not
in this most just occasion of the public gratulacio^ hold my peace. For your
virtuous living ^ue^ from your te^dre years enbraced, followed, and still
continued, your pregnaunt wictines joined with right wonderful grace of
eloquence, your studious diligence in acquirynge knowelage as well of other
human disciplines, as also of holy scriptures, not only to your own edifiyng,
but also to the most godly ensau^ple and enst^uctio^ of others, your
incomparable chastity, which as a most precious jewel y^ have by avoiding
all occasions of idleness, and by conte^nyng prouocacyons of all vain pastimes
kept not only from al spot, but also from al suspicion of stainyng, your
singular modesty coupled with passing great integrity and innocence of all
your behavior, your other manifold inestimable gifts of grace, and among them
most principally your studious seeking to promote the glory of God and of his
most holy gospel, have been the things that have moved the most noble, the
most renoumed, and the most godly Prince of the universal world, our most
gracious sovereign Lord king Henry the eight, to judge and esteem your grace a
me^e spouse for his majesty, and among so many women of nobility, of honor,
and of much high price and worthiness, you alone to pick out to be his most
dear beloved and most lawful wife. Neither do we doubt, most gracious
lady, but that as the providence of god has fourmed and aptised your grace to
be a worthy and mete spouse for such an housbande, so has it by a special
eleccion deputed and prese^ued the same to sum high and notable benefit of the
commonweal, and to be an instrument of his glory. The towardnes and
likelyhode whereof, like as in men's opinions undoubted, so does it already
begin to show it self in a noumbre of things which otherwise were not to
be looked for to proceed from any woman: much less from a woman of nobility
brought up in the court of a king, where Fortune commonly noureeth, cockereth,
and pampereth her derlinges, such as by her will she myndeth and labors to
corrupt with wealth, idleness and vanity, and least of al from a Queen being
set in place, where if she would becum fortunes wanton, she might without
controllement swim in the delices of all such prosperity as might occasion
her to dote on worldely felicity, and to forget god. But the Psalms and
conte^platife meditacions, on which your highness in the lieu and place of
vain courtely pastimes and gaming does bestow your night and days study,
and which ye have set forth as well to the incomparable good exaumple of al
noble women, as also to the ghostly consolacion and edifiyng of as many as
read them, do well declare not only the thing to be true which Socrates
affirmed, that is to we^e* that women, if they do so apply their minds, are
no less apt, no less witty, no less hable, no less industrious, no less
active, no less fruitful and piththy in the acquiryng or handlyng of all
kinds of disciplines then men are: but also how godly ye bestow your time how
littell ye set by the world, how much ye thirst righteousness, how
carefully ye seek the kingdom of god in the mids of a thousand occasions,
which otherwise might withdraw your high estate therefrom.

And because ye so much tender the g^ory of God, that according to the lesson
of Christ ye do first of all other things and principally seek y^ kingdom
of heaven* therefore has he, according to his promise in the same place
contained, and does, and still will of his own provision increase unto you
all kinds of necessary coumforte and consolacion, in much better wise then
your grace could devise, in much larger manner them your own self would wish,
and in far other sort then ye could imagine to look for. These blessings
has his eternal truth and infallible promi^se performed unto your highness,
because ye seek him more then the world, because ye more mind godly
contemplacion then courtly solaces, because ye more tender his glory than any
temporal commodities, because ye esteem the knowlage of his word more precious
then perle, gold, or any treasoures subject to corrupcio^, because ye
prefer the adua^cyng of his holy word before and above al other things,
because ye cease not with all your power, with all your dilygence, and with
all your industry to set forth to all men's knowlage his holy gospel and
testament, the only food and coumfort of our souls. And not only does your
grace with most ernest zele from the first hour of the day to the twelfth,
labor in the vineyarde of Christ, susteinyng the burden of all the who^e day,
and the parc^yng (...) of the smouldring nonetide in your own ^er^o^e: ^ut
al^o at your e^^eding great cost and charges do hire other workmen to labor
in the ^ame vineyarde of Christ's gospel, to the end the same may fruc^^fy
and so ple^tuou^ly bring forth, that al English people may to their health and
ghostly con^olacion be aboundauntely replenyshed with the fruit thereof. And as
a good captain partly to the encouraging of his forward ^ouldiers, and partly
to the shaming of dastardes, or false ha^ted loyterers, ledeth and guides his
army and g^eth himself before the^: so your grace, far otherwise then in the
weak vessels of woman sex is to be looked for, do show unto men a
notable exaumple of forwardene ^e in setting pen to the book, par^ely to the
great coumfortyng of such as feign would do good if they durst, and partly
to the shame and consumelye of sluggardes, who having good talentes do keep
them fast lapped up in their napkins, and live idely. And by this means does
your highness right well declare that all your delight, al your study, and all
your endeavor is by all possible means enploied to the public commodity of
al good English people, the kings most loving and obedient subjects, to be
nou^led and trained in the readyng of Gods word, and in the meditacion of his
most holy gospel. For this ghospel is the same treasour hidden under y^
cloddy hard ground in the field of the letter, which your grace after ye had
found, did for joy selle all that ye had to bye thatsame field withal. And
well may such persons be said to have sold all that they had, who set less
by all the world then by the gospel, and as well for the obteining of the
knowlage to themselfes, as also of desire to help make the same common to
others, does not spare to spend out the treasoures of their gold and
substance. This is that same precious margarite that Christ speaks of, which
your grace seeking for with great desire, (when ye had once found) sold all that ye had to bye, and thought your treasoures well bestowed if it might so
fortune that ye might find means to make all English men which would read
or hear it, to be partakers of the same. This is the grain of mustardesede
which when it was so fine and so little that the unlearned sort of English me^
could scarce possibly feel or see it, ye of your excedi^g charity and zele
toward your country folks, did in such wise help to sow in the field of
England, and did so cherishe with the fa^^e ^atleing earth of the Paraphrase,
that where before it was in the iyes of the vnlet^red, the least of al seeds,
it is now shot up and growe^ much larger in breadth, the^ any other herb of ye
field, so that it now spredeth the branches in such a coumpact, that al
English readers may therein find many places where to light, and to bylde them
nestes, in which their souls and consciences may ^o their ghostely coumfort
quietly repose themselfes. This is the spiritual leaven which your grace
being a ghostly housewyfe for the behoufe of all the whole royalme of England,
and other the kings majesty's dominions* has in such wife hydden in all the
whole four peckes of English meal, East, west, North and South: that by the
benefit and mean of this paraphrase, it is now al made sauoury and of a
pleasannt re^ice to al English peoples taste. Where the text of the gospel
before was in sum parts (though always special good and holsom food and very
restoratiue to such as were able to brook it,) yet to the co^plexcio^ of
gross, rude and grene stomaked Englismen disagreeyng and hard of digestion,
yet ye by procuring the whole paraphrase of Erasmus to be diligently translated
into English, have min^ed it, and made it every English man's meat, though his
stomach be never so weak or te^dre. Where before in sum parts again it seemed
to be so light meat, that the grossest makes did no less to the it, then the
children of Israel did Manna in deserte, when, they said: Our soul is
qualmishe over this meat being toto light, and is ready to cast it up again,
your godly cure in conseruyng it with the paraphrase of Erasmus in English,
has made so ^ounde and substanciall meat for all complexcions of people, that
it may be to every body like the abundance of quailles, rainyng down in
wilderness from heaven, such as best stood with every bodies stomach,
appetite, and most desire to be ple^teously fed withal. Where of it self it
is a meat most pure and simple, and therefore to su^ defutie mouths used to
none but fine terms, to the painted colors and exornacions of Rethorike, it
seems dry and vnpleasau^t, it is now by ye eagredulce sauce of the paraphrase
made more liquide to ru^ne pleasauntly in the mouth of any man which is not to
much infected with indurate blindness of heart, with malicious cancardnes, and
with to to much perverse a judgment. For Erasmus like as he does in all his
works excel and pass the most part of al other writers: so in this work of
the paraphrase upon the new Testamente he passes himself. Therefore most
gracious Lady although your demerites are so far above al praises of man,
that how fer soever I made in magnifiyng your virtuous disposicion, your devout
study and endeavor to do good things, I shall be sure not to incur any
suspicion of flatery* yet do I at this present omittyng al other things, only
in Englandes behalf make one among the rest in rendering public thanks to
your highness, as well for your other godly travail in furtheryng the
knowledge of Gods word, as also most specially in setting men in work to
translate the Paraphrase of Erasmus upon all the new Testament, wherein ye do
both to the young and to the old, as well to the high as to the low, and no
less to ye rich then to the poor, show much more bounteous liberality in
deling about and in making common unto all good English people the heavenly
Jewels of Christ's doctrine, then if ye should open all ^inges cofers of
worldly treasures, and deal to every one such abundaunce as might make them
al welthy and rich for ever in this world. And as ye have herein done a deed
worthy such thanks and rewards as lies in none but only God to repay, and a
deed to us your most loving and obedient subjects so beneficial as no heart can
esteem, (muchelesse any tongue or pen express:) so doubt I not but that ye
have done a good thing to your most regal spouse the kings majesty so
acceptable, that he will not suffer it to lie buried in silence, but will one
day when his godly wisdom shall so think expediente, cause the same
Paraphrase to be published and set abroad in print to the same use that your
highness has meant it, that is to say, to the public commodity and benefy^e
of good English people now a long time foore thirstyng and houngrynge the
syn^ere and plain knowledge of Gods word. For his most excellent Majesty
being a man after the heart of the Lord, being a right David chosen to destroy
Goliath the huge and cumbreous enemy of Israel without any armor, and with
none other weapon but the stone of Gods word cast out of the ^yng of the divine
spirit workyng in him and his laws made here in England, and being the
elected instrument of god to pluck down the Idol of ye Romish Antichrist,
who following the steps of his father Lucifer has not only usurped a kind
of supremitie and tyranny over all princes on earth* as well christen as
heathen, but also has ensourged against heaven, and has lift up and exalted
himself above al thing that is called God, making void the plain
commandments for the aduauncing of his own more then Pharisaical tradicions,
peruertyng the true sense of the holy scriptures and wiestyng them to the
maintenance of his abominacions being both before God and manne detestable: his
highness being our Ezechias by the providence of God deputed and sent to be
the destroier not only of al counterfeit relygio^s (who swarmed among us like
disguised maskers and not mummers, but mumblers, who under the cloak of holiness
seduced ye people, and devoured the houses of rich widows, and were
mainteners of al supersticion, idolatry and rebellion) but also to root up al
Idolatry done to dead images of stone and timber as unto God, and committed to
other creatures in stead of the treatour, directly against the express
words of the precepte: Thou shall have no mo gods but me, his most
excellent majesty (I say) from the first day that he wore the imperial
Croune of this realm, foresaw that to the executing of the premises it was
necessary, that his people should be reduced to the sincerity of Christ's
religion by knowing of Gods word: he considered that requisite it was his
subjects were nousled in Christ by reading the scriptures, whose knowlage
should easily induce them to the clear espiyng of all the fleightes, of the
Romish iugglyng. And therefore as soon as might be, his highness by most
wholesome and godly laws, provided that it might be leful for all his most
faithful loving subjects to read the word of god, and the rules of Christ's
discipline, which they professed: he provided that the holy Bible should be
setforth in our own vulgar language, to the end that England might the
better attain to the synceritie of Christ's doctrine which they might draw
out of the clear fou^tain and spring of the gospel, running evermore clear
without any more or mud, rather then out of ye muddie lakes, and puddles
purposely infected with ye filthy dregs of our Philistines the papists, who
had stopped our spriges to drive us to their poisoned muddy gutters and
forowes. By this his majesty's most godly provision it has cum to pass, that
the people which long time had been led in error and blindness by blind guides,
monks, friars, chauons, and papistical preachers, do now so plainly see the
clear light, that they do willi^gly abhor idolatry and supersticion: they do
now know their duty toward God and their prince; they do now enbrace y^
verity for verities sake: they see where and how the leaven of the papists
has by continuau^ce of time and for default of scripture, soured all the whole
batche of Christ's doctrine: they see how being led by blind guydes and
pastors in the derkenes of ignorance, they fell daily in the deep pit^e of
manifold errors with the same guides, they see that like as the old Phariseis
in the time of Christ's being upon earth, had corrupted the sincere doctrine of
gods word; and the pure understanding of the law, teaching the people to leave
their poor fathers and mothers destitute contrary to the plain commandment,
rather then to let their treasury to be not enriched, which kind of offering,
themselves of me^e couetise had inverted, and did apply the same to the
mainteynaunce of themselfes in gluttony and sensuality: so now had the wicked
papistry devised a mean to pick the rich folks purses, and the poor
vulgar people clean to dengur under the color of going on pilgremage to this
or that stock of man's handy making, and under pretense of sekyng health of the
soul and remission of sins, at the hands of Peter, James, John, and Marie,
which could not give it, but when such things were asked them, blushed to
bear god tho^ly autour and gener of all good things to be so blasphemed. They
see now that like as ye covetous Phariseis passed less at the violacio^ or
breakyng of gods precepts, then of their tradicions, and put more justice in
washyng the outesyde of their dishe or their cup, then in the innocence of
life and purity of the conscience within, in offryng of myntes and rue for
their lucre, then in perfourmyng the office of charity to the neighbor,
sooner to wynke at their own blasphemies against god, then to remit a small
trespace committed by their weak brother against the fond ceremonies which
they and the lawyers had devised and added besides the law: so the beast of
romish abominacion to had clean subverted the true interpretacion of Christ's
gospel, and by his mere tira^nie joined with most crafty delusion, to had
inuected into Christ's church and holy congregation, al things that were
contrary to Christ, that is to wete, instead of pure faith such as Christ
requires, a faith lapped in a patched cloak of beggarly works and ceremonies
of his own dressyng, and setting forth instead of religion, supersticion:
offrynges instead of charity: buildyng of chauntries in place of releuyng and
mainteining the lively temple and image of God in the poor: encensyng of
images instead of the pure sacrifice of an innocent life: instead of trusting
in gods mercies trusting in tre^tals and masses of scala cell: instead of
heaven, a purgatory consisting of material fire, and the same to be redeemed with
money given to him: instead of declaryng our free redemption in Christ and by
Christ sealed with his most precious blood, the Antichrist of Rome seduced the
simple people to put their affyaunce for remission of sins and obteinyng
the joys of heaven, by his pardones contained in a piece of parchement or
paper with a lump of lead ha^ging at it, and to be bought of him or of his
generation the monks and friars for money: instead of the holy bible, legenda
sanctorum, the miracles of our lady, and martiloges, which themselfes devised
and never durst set forth until the party of whom they were made, had been
an hundred years dead, for fear of being taken in a lie: instead of obeiyng
our liege lord and sovereign, to be subject to foreign potentates: with other
abuses so innumerable, that no time or words may suffice to declare or reken
them up. And in this blindness had England still continued, had not god of his
infinite goodness and botto^les merry reised up unto us a new Ezechias to
confou^d al idols, to destroy al hillalters of supersticion, to root up al
counterfeit religions, and to restore (as much as in so little time may be)
the true religion and wurship of god, the sincere preaching of gods word, and
the book of the law, that is to say of Christ's holy testament to be read of
the people in their vulgar tongue. That if in so little time having no more
help but the mere text of the Bible, the people through the goodness of god
and the instincte of his holy spirit have had the iyes of their heart and soul
so opened, that they have not only espied the abuses before mentioned, and
thousands mo in which the Romyshe Babylon has certain hundred of years
holden all christendo^e captive and thrall: but also have so co^formed themself
to the sincere doctrine of Christ, that they do with most glad will, with most
earnest zele, and with most studious diligence enbrace the truth, abhor the
errors wherein the^ were before drouned, detest the supersticions wherewith they
were before delited, hounger and thirst the sincere knowlage of Gods word by the
goodness of God, and the gracious provision of our most noble Ezechias King
Henry the eight, now daily minystred unto them: how is it likely that they
would profit in godly knowlage if they had sum other godly exposicion or
declaracio^ of sum good sincere writer upon the new Testament for their ferther
edifiyng? Of which sort truly there cannot one manne be picked out more apt
and mere then Erasmus, especially in this his Paraphrase, which your highness
of a most godly zele has thus procured to be turned into English: whose
doctrine as it is not in any point (after my poor judgment,) corrupt, so
does it without violence or extremity of words utter the doctrine, edifye
the conscience, declare many abuses, detecting the enemies of Gods word and
supplanters of his gospel, by such true and lively marks, that they may be
easilye known, so that it cannot be doubted, but it should be incredible
furtheraunce toward the rypyng of the knowelage of Gods word, if it
might or shall so stand with the pleasure of one fayde most gracious
sovereign Lord, being next and immediately under God our supreme head.
Which thing verily I would wish and pray to God might so frame for two
consideracions, the one, because that the people having the Paraphrase of
Erasmus, shall have the pyth of all the doctors and good writers, that have
any thing set forth for the declaracion of the ghospels, the Acts, and the
Epistles, so that Erasmus may stand one alone in as good stead as a great
number of other expositours setfoorth together: and the other, because my heart
does wyshe that ye setting forth of gods glory, the destroiyng of idols, the
confoundyng and defacing of all popish trumpery, the publishing of the bible,
and gospel of Christ, so godly by his highness intended, so stoutely entered,
and so luckily begone, might by the same our most gracious sovereign be in such
wise prosecuted and brought to effect, that when heaven no longer willing to
spare him to the world, but that he must give place to nature, shall call him
to receive a croune of immortality, and he for desire thereof shall willingly
surre^dre and give up this imperial croune of worldly dignity, to the most
regal Impe his son, our noble prince Edward, he may deliver to the same a
people so well framed, and trained to his hand, that the same may with all ease
and prosperous success, and without any let of stumblyng blocks to be laid
in his way by papistrie, continue the godly trade now at this day well
begone and (thanks to god) luckily proceeding. I would wish (as in deed I hope
no less,) that he might not need to be put to any ferther trauayl or cure, but
well to co^serue and keep things in the same stay and order that his most noble
father minds to leave all unto him. Our David Henry theight has already so
substancially cast the foundation, and reised the buildyng of the Temple, that
I trust it shall be no burden for our young Salomo^ to consummate and fynyshe the
same when his time shall cum. But now I perceive my self, while I enter into
opening the desire and prayer of my heart, to have entered into such a large
field of talk, which the experience of king Henry's exaumple concerning the
trade of religion, and the hope of prince Edward to be a right follower of so
right a ledyng father, does minister unto me, that except I here suddenly
break of, I am drawn to wade so fer in their praises, that I were not hable
in long time to find any way out again. Omitting therefore at this present the
most worthy and most lustely deserved praises of them both, I shall turn
my style sum what to treat of Luke, whom it pleased your highness to commit
unto me to be translated. Which commandment when it came first unto me in
your graces name although I knew how little it was that I could do in this
kind, yet was I glad that your commandment did so iustlye concur with the
determinacion of mine own mind and purpose. For I had long time before with
mature deliberacio^ and also with advised eleccion appointed with my self to
translate this paraphrase upon Luke, as soon as any such liberty might be,
and to make it unto your grace a testificacion of my duty and thankful
remembrance of your manyfolde benefits before done to me of your mere bounty.
And two things there were that had moved me to take this province most
specially in hand, ye ^^e because that as Luke is the longest of all the
Evangelists, so is he of al men noted to have written his gospel most
exactely, as well by relacion of ye Apostles which were present and conuersaunt
with Christ while he lived on earth, as also by the instruccions of Paul, who
was most earneste and full in the iustificacion of feith, and most piththy
against the iustificacion of words (albeit they do al in this point of
doctrine thoroughly consent and agree.) The second was, for that Erasmus who did
in this paraphrase bestow more diligence then in most of the others, had
specially dedicated the same unto our most noble king Henry theight. And I
thought I could not devise any apter gift to present his most dear beloved wife
withal being of the like zele, affeccion, godliness, and devotion that he is,
then the same work, translated into English, which I certainly knew his
majesty to had singularly well allowed and most graciously accepted in
latin, and in perusyng thereof to be daily excedyng much delighted. And I
nothing doubt, most gracious Lady, but that the readyng thereof should cause no
less delectacion of mind to you, if ye thing were so well done as sum man of
more learning perchance could have doe^ it. And in this behalf none other
refuge I have but to your most benign favor and pardone well to accept mine
honest heart, mine earneste zele, and willing labors. For as touching the
translacion self, though I judge and plainly confess my self to be by many
degrees inferior in knowledge and faculty to all the others whom I hear that
your highness has appointed to the translating of the other parts, and though
I cannot of my self promise any hablenes to take such a province in hand: yet
(my heart better seruyng me hereunto then perchance my hand has done) when I
saw that your graces resolucion and pleasure did help to minister courage to
mine own hertes desire, I conceived boldness to attempt and enterprise the
thing, and thought it most expedient to show mine obedience and prompt good will
to do your commandment, trusting that though I have not been hable in all
behalfes and points requisite, fully to discharge ye office of a good
tra^slatour, yet I have expressed ye se^ce and meaning of the autour. As for
the grace of the latin tongue I think impossible to be lively expressed, as
this autour does it in the latin by reason of sundry allusions, diverse
proverbs, many figures, and exornacio^s retoricall, with Metaphores
innumerable, which cannot with ye like grace be rendered in any other language
the^ in the latin, or greek, besides that an infinite sort of words there
be, whose full importyng cannot with one mere English word equiualently be
interpreted. And this imperfeccion I have to my little power so labored to
redoub, that I trust there be not any point of piththie significacion any
where contained, which I have not in one or other place of the sentence by sum
means thoroughly touched. And for as much as I consider it to be a paraphrase,
that is to say, a plain setting forth of the sense of the text with as many
words as the circumstaunce thereof for the better linking of one sentence to
an other does require, I have not so precisely bound my self to every word and
syllable of the letter, but that I have taken more respect to thexplanacion and
declaring of the se^ce, the^ to the noumbre of the latin syllables. In
translatyng of the very text I think it requisite to use sum scrupulositie
(and if the translatours were not altogether so precise as they are, but had
sum more regard to expressing of the sense, I think in my judgment they
should do better) but in a paraphrase which of it self is a kind of
exposicio^ and of co^mentary, I think it nothing needful to be so precise in
the words, so the sense be kept. And this I dare auouche, that if any
interpretour should in sum places be as brief in the English translacion as
the autour is in the latin: he should make thereof but a dark piece of work.
For that is the only thing that makes the very text self so derke as it
appears to be. In Luke I have had sum what the more business, because that
the Latin exemplaries (thorough whose defaulte of negligence I am uncertain,)
do vary and not well agree, sum having more or less then others, sum having an
other word than an other copye hath^ sum being otherwise poynted then the
rest. Whereby I have in sum places been driven to use mine own judgment in
rendrynge the true sense of the book, to speak nothing of a great noumbre of
sentences, which by reason of so many members, or parentheses, or digressions
as have cum in place, are so long, that unless they had been sumwhat divided,
they would have been to hard for an unlearned brain to conceive, much more
hard to conteyne and keep it still. As touching the style (because the
judgments of readers be diverse, and sum love length, sum desire brevity,
sum can well away with elegaunte speech, sum have all curiosity, sum commend
an eloquente style, sum think nothing to be plain enough, sum will be busy
judges, of other men's writings and do nothing themselfes:) it may please your
most gra^ious patience to suffer me to say my poor judgment, for the
satisfiyng of them that are reasonable. First I would not have every reader to
require in every writer to be like his own wit or conueyghaunce, or style,
or phrase of speaking: but rather to consider that every man has a vein of
his own, either by imita^ion so confirmed, or by long use so rooted, or of
desire to be plain and clear, so grown into an habit: that he cannot
otherwise write then he does. Sum writers hate brevity, and sum think al
long things to be tedious, and yet is neither of these two sorts to be
reproved, so ye ma^^er be good, the making fine, the terms apt, and the style
flowynge with ^ut curiosity or affectacio^. For like as Cicero was so copious
that nothing might be added unto him, so was Demos^henes so brefe that nothing
might be taken away. The Same in latin is between Cicero and Saluste. But Tully
would not leave till the iye, the ear, and also the mouth of the reader were
full even in every sentence: Saluste was loath to tyer any of these with a whole
oracion. The Laco^s could abide no length, the Sophistes of greece could
through their copiousnes make an Elephaunt of a ^lye, and a mountain of a
molle hill. And this I speak rather in commendacion of eloquence, of copy of
elegan^ie of style where it is, then to claim that there is any such here.
Ou^de, Tullie, Erasmus could have proceeded in any their inuencion eue^
infinitely, sum other wits could not so. Sum love it when it is style like,
and sum care for no more but the bare sense. But eloquence of it self, and
copy (that is to say shift of terms) is a virtue in an oracion, and that
thing chiefly gives to b^kes that the latin men call genium, that is life
and continuau^ce, that every man will an hundred years after set store by it,
and esteem it worth many times readyng over. What other thing commends
Chaucer and causes his works to be more set by then thousands of other
freashe hastye books hastily shootying forth like May flowers, and not
wythering but utterly diyng with the first readying? Nevertheless no man of
our time and in our English toungue (which none but our selfs for our own use
do much pass on,) writes so ornately, but that he has in sundry words and
phrases sum smatche of his native country phrases, that he was borne in. Yet
this notwithstanding sum there be, which have a mind to renew terms that are
now almost worn clean out of use, which I do not disalowe, so it be done
with judgment. Sum others would ampliate and enrich their native language with
mo vocables which I also commend, if it be aptely and wittily assaied. So that
if any other do innouate and bring up a word to me before not used or not
heard, I would not disprasse it: and that I do attempt to bring to use, another
man should not cauayle at. For an easy thing it is to deprave, and a small
glory for one man, in matters of nothing, to labor to deface an other. But
for as much as both do our best, we ought rather thus to think the one of
the other.

This man has seen that I have not: I see no man is so barrain, but he is able
with sum word or other to help garnishe his mother tongue, with other like
sayings proceeding from humanity and favor to encourage such as are
studious. And what if one labor to enrich his country language, as Tullie
glories that he did amplify the latin tongue, is he therefore to be blamed, and
not rather to be commended? Thus much I say for the defense of writers and
styles in general. As touching mine own style in this present work, if I
should be so straightly examined, I am (as the Greek proverb says) in like
case as a man that should hold fa^^ a woulf by both ^ares. For if he hold him
still, he has a shrewe in handelyng and cannot so continue ever: if he let him
go, he is in ieopardy: so should I in this matter stand in a strait ^rake,
either to incur suspicioun of arrogantie, if I maintein mine own, and by
standing in defense thereof to be denied opi^at^^e, or ambicious of
singularity: orels I must be driven to grant an error, where perchance
(...) is. Lettyng pass therefore all such kind of trauersyng, I shall remitte
this whole cause (as Tullie does of his book which is entitled De (...)) to
the judgment first of your highness, whom if my la^^^rs do (...), I shall
the better like my self, and than of others, others I say, in who^ rests
humanity to take and interpret all things is the best in whom is moderation
rather to pardone sum faults, than to condemn the thing which though they
can, they will not amend: in whom ^s faculty and knowlage to judge right: in
whom rests favor to wynke at a little ^eippe or stoumb^ing in a long piece of
work: in whom learning and skilfulnesse does work indiffere^cye of
affeccion: and finally in whom dwells reasonable consideracion of man's
infirmity* that the best learned does sumtimes err, and no man at all times
does all things right. For unto such an one as will be a more ^e^ere and
heavy judge on an other man's labors, then himself either would be, or would
have others to be on his own, I can say nothing but this: I for my part can do
no better, if I could I would, and in case ye will either for respect of the
public benefit which is meant herein, orels for ^one toward me, or else for
any other just consideracion take your pene and amend any fault that ye shall
see* I shall not only not think any wrong done to me, but also I shall with
all my heart give you thanks for that ye so much tender either my poor
honesty, or the thing self, that ye would put to your helpyng hand to make it
well. And thus I surceasse with my vain talk any longer to deteyne your
highness from the fruitful readyng of Erasmus, whereof may redounde such
edifiyng and increase of knowledge to the same, as the labor of readyng may be
well bestowed, and the book through your graces commendacion be one day set
forth to the public utility and benefit of all the whole devout
congregation of this church of England.

Yeuen at London the last day of Septembre, in the year of our Lord.MD.xiv.
The preface of Erasmus unto his paraphrase upon the gospel of Luke.
Unto the most puissaunt and most victorious Prince Henry the eight, king of
England, France, and Ireland, and defendour of the Catholic faith, Erasmus of
Roterodame wishes long health, with all honor and prosperous continuance.
Most regal and princely King Henry, I send unto your highness Luke the
physician, not any other Luke then ye had of him heretofore, but the same Luke
speaking somewhat more plainly and also more at large unto the ears of such
as are used to good latin. Neither do I suppose it any thing needful for me
here now in this matter, to spend labor appeacyng and satisfiyng these
kind of people, which commonly allege unto such as I am, that it was a
sentence by right great learned me^, very well taught, that in giving of gifts
or prese^tes men ought to have a special iye and regard, that the things
which we give, be apt for the parties that they are given unto. I for my
part did this thing not long sense, at what time I dedicated the Paraphrase
upon Matthewe unto Charles the Emperor: yea and before my time also it has of
right excellent clerks, by prescripcion of aunciente custom and usage, been
plainly declared, that any kind of argument what ever it be, is rightly and
well dedicated unto princes, whom though we know that they will never read it,
yet is thus much utility and benefit gotten thereby, that under the title of
their names, the work is the better ha^led to the fa^sies of studious persons,
according as Plinius finely wrote, certain things even for such only respect
to be reputed very precious, because they are dedicated for jewels in temples.
But certes the waywardness of sum persons toward books, when they cum^
newely forth, is so great, that they will bid away with the books out of
their sight, ere they take any assay or taste of the same. And by this means
there perishes as well to the writer ye feute which he hoped to have thereby,
as also to the reader, his due profit and utility. And at such men's hands,
one thing at least wise shall the title of noble princes obtein when it is set
in the first frount of any book, that they will not give sentence on it to be
utterly naught, that they will not disdain it, that they will not spet on it
before they have red it. Albeit eue^ otherwise also the godly zele and
affeccion of sum princes does make, that whosoever sends the gospel to any
King for a present, shall not seem to do against good reason. For by men of
right good credit, and such as use not to lie, it has been repor^ed unto me,
as well that Charles the Emperor, in case any vaca^t time of leisure may in
so great unquietness and troubleous state of the world be gotten, does
gladly bestow the same in readyng the gospel book: as also the most renoumed
Prince Ferdinando, brother to the same Charles, much and often to have in his
hands the Paraphrase upon the gospel of Saint John, which not very long
agon I dedicated unto him: yea and furthermore that ye right noble king of
Denmark Christie^e, which thing may to your highness also be well known, has
books of christian religion often times in his hands, and that he with great
desyrefulnesse uses to read my paraphrase upon the ghospel of Matthew. Why
than should the ghospel seem to be unaptly sent unto those which are handlers
and lovers of the ghospel, which gospel certes is to be had and used in the
hands of all persons as many as remember and think themselfes to be
Christyans. Now although after the rate of worldely dealyng, such a thing is
most chiefly to be given, as the party has need of to whom it is sent, yet
after the rule of the gospel, whosoever has already, to him must needs be
given, that he may have plenty. Wherefore me thought I should do but as might
best stand with congruence, to send this Euangelical physicion unto your
highness, for as much as the same is so far from disdainyng holy scriptures,
that (as your own writings do testifye,) ye have above the mean rate
profited in the same, so that if a man give unto your grace any thing to holy
scripture apperteinyng, he shall not seem so much to give a gift, as to make
amends and recompense for a pleasure received. Moreover if this be a thing
specially above others in all haste provided for, that in the kings and
Emperors courts there may from time to time be physicions ready and pressed at
hand (being men exactly learned and of approved fidelity) to take charge that
the princes be dye be preserved and kept in health: how much more does it
stand with congruence, that Luke the physicion should there be reslaunte, who
does not with scammony or ellebour preserve the healthful state of the body,
but does with an heavenly pocion deliver the soul from diseases that violently
hale men to death everlasting, that is to were, yt unknowing of the truth,
mistrustfulnesse and unbelief toward God, the love of this world, ambicion,
avarice, riottous excess, hatred, envy, and such others? For these diseases
is all the life of mortal men subject unto, and daily in danger of falling
into them, as John thapostle says, where he bewayleth that all the whole
world is set in naughtiness, neither any thing else to reign therein, but
concupiscence of the flesh, concupiscence of the iyes, and pride of the life.
And in so much the more peril and hasard of the said diseases do the princes
stand, as they are more then others made wantons and derelynges of fortune, and
have liberty without check or controllemente to fullfyll their own sensual
lusts and appetites. But now me seems I shall not spend my labor in vain
but to good purpose, if I shall in a few words commend and set Forth unto
your highness, first Luke himself being the physicio^, and then the pocio^ or
medicine that he brings with him, albeit I put no doubts but yt as well the
one as the other is already (as in deed they ought to be) unto your godly ze'e
and devotion in most best wise accepted. Forsooth this same is that excellent
man Luke an Antiochian by the country and nation that he was borne in. And
Antioche is a city which was in old time of so great fame and power, that so
much part of all the country of Syria as reaches unto Cicilie and butteth
upon it, had the name given it thereof; And the said Antioche was in this
behalf more happy and fortunate then very Rome it self, yt Peter ye apostle
had his first see here in this city of Antioche and that Paul, and Barnabas
did in the same city receive their dignity of the charge and funccio^
Apostolical. Now to our present purpose this Luke was of familiar acquaintance
and comiersacion with all the Apostles, but most specially a follower and
disciple of Paul, and also a companion of his in all his peregrinacio^, never
separated nor divided from his coumpany. By linyng in coumpany with the
Apostles, he wrote his gospel: and by the things which Paul wrought and
did, Luke being a present witness of them, he wrote the book which he
entytled, the acts of the apostles. And that history of the Acts, he
continued until the second year of Paul abydyng at Rome, that is to say,
until the fowerth year of Nero, the Emperor there. Whereof men gather a
consecture that the book was written in the same city. and fully agreed it is
among the learned men, ii. Cor. viii.
that this same very Luke it is, of whom Paul the Apostle does so often times
make mention: as for e^aumple, in his second epistle to the Corinthians, where
he thus says: We have sent with him our brother, whose land is in the gospel
throughout all the congregacions. Again, where he writes to the Collossta^s,
he says: dear Lukes the physicion greteth you. Colloss. iii. i. Tim. iiii.
And again in the secound epistle to Timothe: For Demas has forsaken me,
loving this present world, and is departed unto. Thessalonica: Crescens, is
gone into Galacia: Titus into Dalmacia: only Lukas is with me. Yea and this
point moreover is leaft to us by ancient writers, that as often as Paul
calls it by ye name of his gospel, (as he does to Timothe, ii. Tim. ii.
where he says: Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David arose again
from death according to my gospel. etc.) he ^^neth of the ghospel of Luke,
because that like as Mark wrote the history of the gospel at Peter's word,
by his settying on, so did Luke at the word and biddyng of Paul. Hierome is of
the opinion and judgment, that Luke was more expert in the greek tongue then
the other were, and by reasoaso^ thereof wrote the discourse and process of the
story after a more e^act and gromidely sort^ then the others did, that is to
were, taking his entrance at the first concepcion of John the Baptist, and
making relacion of very much ma^ter touching the nativity, and concerning
the babehoode, ^ea and certain points furthermore concerning the childhood of
Jesus, making also rehersall of many parables and miracles which the other
eua^gelistes for love of briefnes had let pass he any thing spoken of. And
where ^s not one of all the others went any wh^t ferther then the time of ye
Lord Jesus being assumpted into heaven, this man alone did in an other second
book make a further continuacio^ of the story concerning the church, how it
first sprang up, and how it grew more and more to sprede and show it self.
Thus much moreover the writers affirm: that like as Matthew wrote his
gospel, and Peter his epistles, chyefely unto the Jews: so did Luke write
his gospel most specially to the Gentiles, as one that was a disciple of
Paul's, which Paul as he was the teacher of Gentiles, so did he write all his
epistles unto Gentiles, except the only one epistle to the Hebrews, of ^eaufou^
and writer whereof ^t has evermore been doubted whether it were Paul or not.
He wrote his ghospel after Mark, but yet before that John ^o^e his, by reason
whereof being but a disciple, he is set before John who was an Apostle. And to
conclude, it is written that a long lived manne he was, which thing was in a
physicion, even as of congruence it ought to be. for he followed ye cou^sa^le of
Paul, which wrote: It is good not to touch (...): he lived a single man four
score and four years.

The bones of him after he was dead, were removed and conveyed out of Achaia, to
Constantinople, together with the bones of Andrewe the apostle, in the
twe^tieth year of Co^stancius. Ye have now a phi^icion for the soul of a
physicion for the body, a man by his familiarity of conversation, with the
Apostles habled, and by mo testimonies then one of Paul the apostle, commended
and praised, and by the wholle consent of all the faithful congregacio^s
allowed. For where the gospels of many were rejected and refused, Luke was by
the consent of all the congregacions voices received, to make up that same holy
and mistical quaternitie, which Moses in old time limyted out, when he
expounded unto us the fower-studdes or rivers welling up out of one spryng in
paradise, which studdes do water all the earth universal: and the which
quaternitie the Prophet Ezechiell afterward saw, wh^^ he plainly set out unto
us (as it had been in a picture) the four mystycall beasts and the four
wheles in one. Now if it be so thought good, let us in few words, sumwhat
speak of the pocion or medicine that he has given us. He had been wont out
of Hyprocrates to take medicines wherewith to remedy diseases of the body, but
this medicine of the ghospel, wherewith to cure and heal our souls, he took of
the Apostles, which had both seen and heard Christ, yea or rather of the very
holy ghost himself.

There was among the physicions of old time, a certain kind of medicine of
passing great efficacy and virtue, which medicine they called in Greek the^^
Chr^i^^^s, that is to say, Gods hands, like as there is now a confeccion that
is called manus Christi. But yet was there never any medicine invented by the
Phisicions, that was able to remedy al diseases of the body, though they make
never so much vauntes and boast of that same which they call, pa^^^^, a
medicine (as they affirm) effectual and of much virtue, but known to us man.
Once the sickness of old age gives place to no phisike. But this same medicine
of the ghospel is in very true deed, the manus Christi* which thorough sincere
faith does once for altogether take away all diseases of the souls, and
gives immortality: which thing apperteineth only unto god to do. And certes
it was a thing not vnfearly ne unskillfully spoken in the proverbs of the
Greeks, that words and talk is the physicion of a mind being dyseased and
sick: yea and sum there has been, which believed that the diseases of the body
also might be driven away with certain hearty words aduysedly spoken, having
a certain magical virtue and efficacy in them. The Lord Jesus was a phisicio^,
who while he lived here on earth, did with his words put away diseases of the
bodies, were they never so sore, or of never so long continuance rooted in
them. Yea and with his words he raised dead folks to life again. For his
word was no word of magike: but the almightyful word of the omnipote^t
father. The same Christ did also with his word drive away diseases of the
souls, when he said: Son thy sins are forgeuen the^ and in an other place:
Go thy ways, thy faith has made the whole. And in co^sideracion hereof the
prophecy had before promised y^ Christ should be a physicion. For it says in
the book of Sapience: For neither any herb ne any supplyng plaster has
healed them, but thy word, o Lord, which heals all things. Thissame verily
is that true (...), that the phisicious speak of, as before said. Also the
mystical psalm has this sentence. He sent his word, and he healed them from
their utter peryshynges. The liuelye word of the father is Christ. He had
sent Moses and the prophets: and by them was the nation of the Jews taken in
cure to be looked unto, but they were not clean healed. Only the word of the
father was of sufficient virtue and efficacy to heal the diseases of man,
and not only the light dyseases, but also the mortal and deadly
sickenesses. For it is a mark whereby to know that it speaks of deadly
sickenesses, when the prophet adds, from their utter perishynges. At such
time as the stomach is so clean fallen away that it abhors and refuses
all kind of meat, than grows the sick party to wards his death, and of
such manier a disease was all the whole universal world sick, before the
cumming of the heavenly phisician. Which thing had the psalmiste a little
tofore spoken: Their solle abhorred all kind of meat, they were drawn nere,
even to the gates of death. There had been many soondry dren^hes tempered by
the philosophiers, as for exaumple, by the sect of Pythagoras, by the
Academikes, by the Stoikes, by the Epicureans, and by the Perepatetikes,
promisyng perfect health of the minds, yea and heavens bliss too. Moses
tempered many pocions, prescrybyng and appoyntyng soondry ceremonies of
religion and of seruyng* god: the prophets also made much and many
temperynges to the same end and purpose: but by reason of diseases growyng
strong and preuayling, the physic and medicines auailed not, ne did any other
good, saving that it increased the diseases, and bewrayed the same that it
might appear. The stomach of the soul being corrupt with naughty desires,
as it had been with evil and hurtefull humors, did on the one side turn
their face away from the moral precepts and lessons of the philosophiers
composed with great labor and study: and on the other side by the
ordinances and prescripcions of Moses* they were made the more supersticious,
but nothing the better men. As for the bittur chydyng which the prophets
ministered, had no good relice ne taste in their mouths, and therefore was there
no credyte given to their promises. Which thing the father of heaven when he
saw, because he would not have any thing to perish of all that he had
created: sent forth his word who should with an heavenly medicine deliver
all people from all diseases of their souls, only requiryng of us to
acknowleage our disease, and put assured trust and confidence in the phisician.
And like as the loving and frendely phisicia^s, if at any time they cannot
still remain to be evermore present with their pacientes, do commonly use to
leave some box or receypt of physic with them, whereby the parties that are
sick may be their own phisicians, if the case should so require: so the
lord Jesus when he returned into heaven, leafte unto us by his Apostles a
medicinable electuarie of the gospel, both easy and ready for every body
that will take it, but of great virtue and effect, if a man receive it as it
ought to be: and certes to take it to ones profit and benefit, the chief
thing that works it, is his assured trust and affiaunce in the phisician.

Neither is it enough to have taken a stendre taste or assaye thereof, but it
must be received and conueyghed into the veraye bowels, that as soon as it is
received within the stomach, the virtue thereof may have full course to run
every way throughout all the veins. At such time and never till than it
begins to roumble and shake all the party from top to toe with the hatred
of his former life: but after this great troublyng and confusion, immediately
ensues great tranquillity of mind and quiet of the conscience. The
phisicians of the bodies, have practicioners, and poticaries that do ministre
their art under them: and theimselues are the prescribers and appoyneters what
it is that must be given to the sick: Christ alone it is and none else, that
has prescribed the medicine of everlasting salvation. The Apostles, and their
successors the bishops, are no more but ministers, they temper in due
proporcion, they fine and beat to powder, they lay to the places diseased,
not receiptes of their own, but of Christ's. They baptize in water, but
Christ it is that washes the soul clean: they teach the things which he
taught and delivered unto them, but Christ's own self it is, which makes
that their words may take effect. The corporal phisicians do often times
vary as well in their judicials of the diseases, as also in appoyntyng
medicines for the same: yea and many times instead of medicines they appoynte
things that are beray poison to the sickness, according to the saying of the
greek Poet.

Many of the medicines be good that are wrought,

And many of them again are sterke staryng naught.

But of the physic and medicine Evangelical, there is but only one
receip^t, which ought of no mortal creature to be either corrupted or
altered. And finally to conclude, it is confect of no mo but one simple, so
that although they, whose part and duty it were to be ministers of the
same, would be slack to do their office, every man may take it and
ministre unto himself, so that he have a mind feithfully trustyng, a mind
sincere, and desirous of health. For even that same chief and head phisician
of all, who alone and none but he is of power hable to heal all the whole
manne, did at some seasons give health by himself in his own person, and
many times also by the ministry of his Apostles and disciples. Now
ferthermore all the whole faculty and art of physic, has two marks that
it principally shoteth at: the one that it may deliver the body from
diseases, and from such things as do bread diseases, and this part is by
the phisicans term, called therapeutica, that is to say, the art of curyng
or healyng diseases: secondelye their art is to preserve and continue the
healthful state of the body, and to encreace the strength: and this part of
physic they place in the ordreing of the diete.

For the phisicians do not evermore sere with hot yrons, or cut, they do
not evermore give pocions of scammonie to consume and waste the fleashe as men
in manier sleaghyng and martiring the body, to keep it in life: but sometimes
they ministre such things as may make the heart light and m^rie, yea and
also they give the body sustinaunce at large: So there is first of all
ministered unto us the pocion of faith, which troubles the soul and
conscience with repentance, and emptying us, does discharge and unlade us of
our sin. Than immediately thereupon is given an electuarie of consolacion, of
exortyng and of more perfeict doctrine. For if a phisician, as soon as he has
made the body empty by purgacion, should soodaynely give up the sick pacient
and leat him alone, it is an hazard and ieopardie lest when it is destytute
of all the strength, some power and rage of a greater sickness may take it,
as for example, the paulsey, the general taking or dissolucion of all the
limbs and senewes, whereupon men lie bedred, or a consumpcion. So after that
repentance has cast down our comb, and has well shaken our disease, wha^
baptism has scoured or pourged us and made us empty and void from al
sins, there be such things ministered, and given to us, as may holsomlye
replenishe the soul again being now well cleansed and made void. Wrathfulnes
is voyded out, and tentilnesse and meekness is instead thereof infused. Envy
is sucked out, and taking of all things to the best, put in for it. Picling
and pollyng is voyded out, and in place thereof succedeth liberality. The
fervent desire of making war, is consumed away, and the earnest zele of
peace comes in for it. The love of sensual pleasures of the flesh is
expelled, and in their stead enters the love of things celestial. Will ye
hear what is the s^ammonie evangelical? Do ye penance. The axe is now
already set at the root of the tree. And every tree that brings not
forth good fruicte is cut up. And Paul in like manier: Mortify your
members which are upon earth: whoorehuntyng, uncleanness, wanton lust, evil
concupiscence, and avarice. And within few words after it follows: spoysyng
your selves of the old man with all his acts. He has now voyded out the ill
humors, how does he fill up the empty place again? Do upon your selves,
(says he) as the saints and the elected of God, the bowels of mercy,
bounteousnesse, submission, humility, patience, supportyng one another, and
forgeuyng your selves among you if any person have a querele against an
other, like as the Lord also has given to you. And above all these things
have ye charity, which is the band of perfeccion, and seat the peace of
Christ rejoice in your hearts. Such mannier an house swap^^ clean with
broomes and replenished on every side with such ornaments* the eiuell spirit
shall not eftsoon enter upon, when he returns with seven wurse then
himself. Thus than the Evangelical medicine has wine of it own, wherewith
to scour the mattier of our wounds that they smarte again. Auaunt, come
behind me Satan, thou sauourest not tho things which are of god, but which
are of men. Now see the suppleyng oil o^ the same Have ye a perfect trust and
confidence, for I have ouercommed the world. A hear of head shall not
perish. Be ye not a^earde little flock, for yours is the kingdom of heaven.
Paul has meat, wherewith he coumforteth and cherishes such as are but
newlye converted to Christ, that they may not fall again into diseases,
forasmuch as they are yet weak: he has also sound and substanciall meat
that may keep them in perfeicte strength, growyng forewarde from day to day
unto the measure of the fullness of Christ. Those persons had gathered
perfeict strength, of whom it is thus written in the acts of the Apostles:
They went reioycyng out of the sight of the counsel, in that they had been
reputed worthy to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus. That man also had
gathered perfeicte strength which laid: I can do all things, in him that
makes me strong. And for this consideracion the Lord Jesus in the gospel
exhorts men to the eating of the bread that was come from heaven, the
eating whereof gives immortality. He exhorts men to the eating of his
flesh, and to the drinking of his blood, meaning undoubtedly of his
doctrine, which being as bread to the soul, does make the same lusty and
strong and (as effectual strong wine) does inebricate men and bring them in a
godly kind of drounkennesse, even to the contempt of this world, in like
manner as fleashe has sound nourishemente for the body, and like as blood
has a virtue and effect unto life. And though all the scripture of god have a
medicinable virtue and power in it: yet has it none a more effectual
electualye or receipt then that pertains to the ghospel. One and the same
spirit it is, that is in all the Scriptures of God, but yet in the gospel
especially his pleasure was, that the thing should remain, wherein he might
specially show forth his own power, because there should appear some
difference between the servants and the master, between the puddels or little
gutters, and the spryng or fountain. And truly it is a labor well bestowed,
to considre how great a thing the virtue of this medicine is. Every common
weal is (as ye would say) a certain body. The pestilent diseases and
sickenesses of a common weal, are evil maniers. Against which diseases such
men as have excelled others in wisdom, have in soondrye regions or deyned and
set laws, as it were certain medicines and remedies for the same, as for
exaumple, among the Atheniens, Solon made laws: among the Lacedaemonians,
Lycurgus: among the people of Crete, Minos: among the Romans the ten
Commissioners called in their toungue, Decemuiti. Yet not one of all these men,
was hable to bring to pass, that other nations also would enbrace and receive
the laws that he had made. No neither did any of them so much as attempt
such a thing, lest besides spendyng of labor in vain, he should also have
won an opinion of a shameless act in his so doing. Solon was fa^ to live
ten years a banished man for thrustyng his laws into the city of Athens
alone to be used there. Plato a man so well learned and so eloquent, could
never bring the people of Athens in mind to receive his laws. And yet is
there no doubts to be made, but that every one of them persuaded
theimselues, that the laws which they had made were true, and that they
wisshed (if it might possibly have been brought to pass) that all the world
should have enbraced and received the same. No nor the laws of Moses neither
were ipr^d abroad or received any ferther then within only one nation,
although in deed the Pharisets did with great high suyt hunte to win and
geat unto them a few proselites, that is to say, foreyns and aliens won to
their religion. Finally, not the violent authority of the Emperors neither,
was hable by vyolence or compulsion to obtain, that their laws might have
weight and force with all nations. And the thing which all the said persons
by the laws that they made did endeavor to bring about, the same did also the
Philosophiers attempt by their moral rules and lessons, with great judgment,
and with incomparable diligence and labor written and published. Of al which
nevertheless, not one has there been so eloquente or so well learned, that he
has been hable to bring any one nation in the mind that he would have them
in, so werishe and ineffectual was the virtue of the medicine of physic
which they brought. Only the truth Evangelical did in process of a few
years possess, persuade, and overcome all nations of the world full and
wholle, drawyng unto it the Greeks, and the barbarous peoples, the learned and
the unlearned, the inferior common people, and kings and all. So pith^hy and
so effectual was the electuarie of this truth, that so many thousands of
people forsakyng the laws of their own countries, renouncyng the religion
that their forefathers had used* leauyng as well the sensual pleasures and
vices, which from their cradels they had been accustomed unto: they enbraced a
new and a foreign doctrine, and out of diverse toungues, and ordinances of
contrary sort, they did consent to the receyuyng of a certain low and
basse philosophy: especially at such a time as never was there any of the
like sort furnished nor armed either with the maintenance and supportacion of
learning and eloquence, or with the power and authority of princes: and at
such a time ferthermore wha^ all the world with all the strength that it had,
fought against the truth of the ghospel being unarmed and naked: yet
nevertheless it could not possiblye bring to pass, but that the said truth
after that it first ^ntred possession upon the country of Greece, invaded also
the city of Rome, and the veraye court of Ner^, and forthwith spread it self
abroad throughout all and singular the prouincies of the Empire of Rome, even
until the Isles called Gades, lying in the ferthest part beyond Spaigne, and
unto the Indians, unto the peoples of Afrike, and the Scithians, and the Isle
of Britannia now called England, being a country vttrelye divided and cut
of from all the rest of the world. These nations and peoples did very much
differ one from another in their languages, laws, rytes, vsages, ordeynaunces,
Gods, religion, and facions: and anon being from such great discord
brought to a general uniformity, they begone to sing all one song,
extollyng with lauds and praises Jesus Christ the only lord and salueour of
the world. And all this while, the spoylyng of their goods, their
banishementes, empriesonynges, torments, deaths, were none other thing but
good procedyng and going forewarde of the gospel. What person has there
ever been found, that has been content to suffer death for the laws of
Solon, or the moral precepts of Zeno? But for the simple and plain doctrine
of Christ, how many thousands of men, both old and young, how many thousands
of matrones and vyrgins, have willyngly offered and holden out their necks to
be chopte of? And yet how much more wondrefull, and more abhorryng from
commune reason, are the things which the gospel teaches, then which the
Paradoxes, that is to say the strange opinions of the philosophiers, do
teach? And the said philosophiers doctrine not one of the princes did ever
make any a do to destroy or suppress, and yet of it own accord it
vanyshed away, like as did also their laws, and the art magical, and the
rites of sacryfices. For what creature does at this day sacrifyce unto the
Gods of the Heathen, or slaygheth beasts in sacrifice as the Jews did? What
person does now know of Zoroastes? What man sets an hear by the
mystical riddels of Pythagoras? Who reads the life of Apollonius Tyaneus any
otherwise then as a certain dream? Yea or rather who vouchesalueth to read
it at al? For where Aristotell is at these days of great name and fame in the
schools, leat him never thank his own f^cte therefore, but the Christians.
For even he had perished too, if there had not been made a medley of Christ
and him together in our schools of divinity. Against the philosophy
Euangelical, being, yet but tender and even but newly spryngyng up, the world
arose at the first chop with all his force and power, by mean of the Jews,
under the pretexte and color of religion fightyng against the fountain of
all religion, by mean of the philosophiers being hable much to do in all
kinds of ^earnyng by mean of the Sophisters being fellows impossible to be
ouerco^med in stiffenesse of holdyng argumentacions, by mean of the
rhetoricians being meruaylous in the force of eloquence, by the tyrannes being
armed with all sorts of showing cruelty, by mean of kings, lieutenauntes,
magistrates, by such as were cunnynng in magike and sorcerie, and perfect in
the sleyght of castyng mystes over men's iyes and other senses, and by mean
of eiuyll spirits being the lords of this world. All such tumultuous
buisynesse, as these, (as a sea of eiuils swellyng up and ouerflowyng,) did
the power of the truth Evangelical receive, endure, break through, and
utterly overcome. For at the light of the gospel when it came, it was reason
that all counterfaictes of worldly power should clean vanishe a way. Up shot
that same gospel and showed it self being plain and low, which all men
w^^ great a do endeavored to ouertrede and keep down. The books of such
persons, as with singular high wit, with woondrefull learning, and with
exquisite eloquence wrote against the ghospel, vanished away of their own
accord as it had been certain dreams, insomuche that they are not at this
day remaynyng to be had neither, except if any fragmentes or small pieces
have been saved of the Christians, by reason of writing against them in
confuting them. The kings and princes do now bough down, to honor the
thing which to fore they went about to destroy: the power of magike is
vanished away and gone: the evil spirits are cast out that they howl and
rore again: philosophy has confessed her ignorance: and geuyng over the
foolish wisdom of the world, it has enbraced the wisdom of the cross:
the rethoricians write oracions in the praise of Jesus Christ: the poets do
hiss the old gods out of place, and in the lieu and place of Gods
innumerable, all their song and composyng is now of Jesus Christ alone.
Thissame so great a change of the world, begoonne within a few years after
Christ was put to death, to be made general and common through all the whole
world, and without any maintenance or supportacion of man, it encreaced from
time to time still more and more, until the piece of leaven being miengled in
three pe^kes of meal did* ^auen and turn all the whole batche, and until the
grain of mustard seed being dug into the earth, did far and wide
spleygh his boughs abroad over Asia, over Afrike, and Europe. And over and
besides all this, those persons who laid their battrey against the truth
Euangelical to cast it ^owne and to destroy it, not only had diverse and
sundry kinds of terroures, wherewith even very manly stomakes also might have
been quayled, that is to we^e open commandments by proclamacion,
consistories and places of judgment, forfaityng of al their goods to the
princes, attaindres and depriuacions, banishementes, priesons, torments of
burning plates, scourgyng with ^oddis, axes wherewith to choppe of their heads,
ieobettes, fires to burn them, wild beasts to cast them to, that they might
be devoured, deaths: but also they had diverse and soondrye allurementes,
wherewith an heart though it were right co^tinent might be corrupted. Ceasar
would say to some one of them: Rencague thou and forsake Christ, and be thou
the chief among all my piers, and except thou so do, all thy gooddes shall be
forfayte to my behoufe. I will show all extremity of rigor toward thy wife
and children, and thyselfe for thine own part shall be cast to wild beasts
in a den. Who did in such cases as these persuade so many thousands, and
bring them in mind with reioycyng to take it when their promocions and
dignities were taken from them, when their gooddes were spoiled, that when they
saw those parties haled with all violence to huige torments and execucion of
death, who next after God were most derely beloved unto them, they should
give thanks to God: and finally that themselves when they might easly have
escaped, and when they might have enjoyed such high commodities, should of
their own voluntary wylles off^e themselves to be cruelly martyred? No power
of humayne eloquence could this have dooen: but the godly power of the truth
was hable, which lay hidden in the grain of mustardsede. Neither did the
philosophiers doctrine lack alluremente. The Stoykes promised liberty and
fredome, true richesse, health, reign, and other things magnificent and
royal to be spoken. The Epicureans made high words and promises of pleasure
to the cares of men. The Peripatetikes did couple the good gifts of the body
with virtue. But the doctrine of the gospel as it did not draw any body unto
it with any worldly terrors: so on the contrary part, how fe^re was it from
having any thing commendable in outward show to see to, nay rather how many
things did it contain vttrely incredible? It tells news of one Jesus
nailled on the cross, who had by his death delivered mankind, and this Jesus
to be both god and man, borne of a virgin, and one that had returned again
from death to life, and was now sitting at the right hand of God the father,
and the same Jesus to had been a man that had taught such persons to be in
blissed case, as for the profession of his name did mourn and warle, did
suffer thirst or hungre, were put to affliccion, were evil spoken of, or were
put to death: and that all men shall in time to come arise to life again, and
that the godly sort at that day (the same very Jesus being their judge,)
shall have immortality to their lotte, and the wicked shall have the peines of
hell for ever without end to endure. What philosopher durst have entreprised
to propoune such things as these so far contrary to all men's opinion or
thinkyng, and things so vntouthsome for men to be fond on, or to make any
great countenance unto? Yet all these things nevertheless did the law talk
of, the gospel did in such wise persuade, that such an one is taken for mad
and clean out of his wits, as does not believe it: and that so many
thousands of people will sooner forsake their life, then the profession of the
truth Eua^gelical. And by what manner fellows at last did so great a change of
the world first come up? by mean of a few disciples being men unknown,
men of low degree, men of poverty, and unlearned. To what purpose is it to
speak of the rest, when Peter the chief of them was a fisher, and of no
ferther knowlage but his bare mother toungue, Paul a leather sewer, and not
one of them all, a man of richesse, or a man of power, or a ientle man? And
either nothing at all had they of this worlds, or in case they had aforetymes
had, they clean forsook it. And by what ways was it possible for such men to
bring so great a matier to pass? ^erres they brought a medicine in a vi^e box
but it was through godly virtue, a medicine of great power and efficacy. The
talk evangelical is of a plain homely sort, and of no eloquent composyng,
which in case a man examine and try by the story of Thucidides in greek,
or of Titus Liuius in latin, he shall find a lack of many things, and with
many points shall he be offended. What a noumbre of things do the
Evangelists leat pass, how many things do they touch with three words
and no more* in how many places does the order disagree, and in how many
places do they appear to be one contrary unto another? It was possible that
such things should have turned away the mind of the reader from the readyng
of it, and should have caused it never to be believed. Contrariwyse they that
have written stories of worldly affairs, how careful are they whereof to make
the first beginning of the matter, what labor and diligence do they bestow,
that they may not tell any thing otherwise then is semyng, that they may not
tell any thing unlikely, that they may not tell any thing not standing
together, or any things contrary unto reason?

Than ferther with what evidence do they lay the thing plain before men's
iyes, with what sweet pleasant knackes and conceiptes do they content and
retain the readers mind, that no point of tediousness may come stealyng
upon him? But the monumentes of all this sort of writers having been composed
with great labor and study, are a great portion of them lost, and those that
remain are read neither of all persons, and yet without geuyng any credit
unto them. For what person is there so light of belefe, that he will auouche
and waraunt, that in all Titus Liuius there is no point contained of telling
an untruth? But so many thousands of people there have been found, which
would with better will ten times suffer death, then to admit or grant any
one false clause to be contained in the writings of the gospel. Have we not
than of these premises an evident mark whereby to know the matter not to be
of worldly auctoritee or wisdom, but of the virtue and power of God? There is
a secret virtue and efficacy lying hidden in the medicine, which when it was
once poured into the body, spread it self abroad over all the universal
nations of the world, as if it were by resemblaunce, throughout all the
members. We have now the cause, why the verity evangelical did within so
few years by men of low degree, sprede it self abroad all the world over,
when the same world rebelled against it with all kinds of extreme cruelty.
And now may it come in some man's mind greatly to marvel by what reason it
has come to pass that in those later seasons, when the world had Christian
princes, Bishops, men of learning, welthie and rich persons, and endued with
great authority, the dicion of Christ is so shrounken together into a narowe
room. For the cause of this matier being well known, a remedy might
perhaps the sooner be found. But I having a good while sense forgotten my
self, do pass the limits and bounds of a preface. I therefore return now to
our physician Luke, whom like as I doubt not to be right acceptable unto your
grace: so would I by my good will have him by mean of the same your grace, to
be made the more acceptable unto all people. The wise Ecclesiasticus speaks
in this manier: Honor thou the physician for necessities sake. How much more
than ought condign honor to be showed to this physician, who has ientilly
given us so effectual a receipt of physic, which is to every creature
necessary, except if any such person there be, which is without all fault
and has no need to wax a better man than he was? And certes it will also be
effectual, if we being vttrely weary of our diseases and infirmities, shall
oftentimes byte of this medicine, if we shall continuallye chawe it, if we
shall conueye it to pass into our stomach and into the botome of our heart,
if we shall not vomit up again that has been taken thereof, but shall keep
the same still in the stomach of our soul, until it cast a broad the virtue
that it has, the change us altogether into it self. This point by
experience have I found in mine owneselfe, that little fruit there comes of
the gospel, if a man read it but sluggishely, and superficially run it
over. But in case a man do with diligent and exquisite meditacion keep himself
occupied therein, he shall feel a certain virtue and pith such as he shall not
feel the like in any other books. Now to preuente making of mine answer unto
the suspicious demynges of men, for that I have dedicated every particular
paraphrase of the ghospels severally to particular princes, it is very chance
and not any ambicion or sekyng on my behalf. For the same thing has fortuned
unto me in this matier, that fortuned in the epistles Apostolical. When I
wrote the paraphrase upon Matthewe, I looked for nothing less, then that John
should be earnestly required, and immediately after him this Lukas. But now to
thentente there shall not any glasewyndoore or gappe be seen among the
Eua^gelistes, I will add Mark also unto the other three: albeit he that
dedicateth sondrie ghospels to sondrie men, may seem to do never a whit more
contrary to reason, then did Sayncte Hierome, who dedicated, yea even the
lesser Prophets, unto several persons. I have elsewhere given aduertisemente,
and do now eftsons give warning unto the reader, that he esteem no more
authority to be in any paraphrase of mine, then he would give to the
commentaries of other writers. For I do not for any such purpose write
paraphrases, because I would shake or strike the gospel out of men's hands,
but to thentente it may be read the more commodiouslye to a man's mind, and
with the more fruit, like as meats are sauced to the end they may be taken
with the better will and the more delectacion. Yea and of one ferther point
also must I here warn a reader that is somewhat gross of understanding,
which is, that it be not mine own words that I do any where speak in the
paraphrase, lest the thing which under the person of the Euangeliste is
humbly and truly spoken, may seem to be arrogauntlye spoken under mine own
person. The lord Jesus give his spirit unto you, most noble king, to the
end that under your proteccion being a true Christian Prince in deed, the
verity of the gospel may from day to day more and more reign and
flourishe.

Yeuen at Basil the.xxiii. day of August in the year of our Lord M.D.xxiii.
The life of saint Luke written by S. Hierome.
LUke a physician, and borne in Antioche, was not ignoraunte of the Greek
toungue (as his wrytynges do show) he was a follower and disciple of the
Apostle Paul, and a companion of all his peregrinacion: He wrote a volume of
the gospel, of whom the same Paul says in this manner. We have sent with
him a brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the congregacions.
And again to the Colossians: Most dear Luke the physician greteth you. And to
Timothy. Luke is with me alone. Be set forth also another special goodlye
book which is entitled the Acts of the Apostles, the story whereof came even
full to Paul's time being and tarying two years at Rome, that is to say,
until the fourth year of Nero the Emperor there. Whereby we do well perceive
that the said book was made in the same city. Therefore as for the circuites
of Paul and of Tecla the virgin, and all the tale of Leo by him baptized, we
rekon among the scriptures that are called Apocrypha. For what manier a thing
is it, that a companion which never went from his elbowe, should among his
other mat^ers be ignorant of this thing alone? Tertullian which was nere
unto that time, reports that a certain priest in (...) being an
affeccionate favorer of the Apostle Paul, was co^uicte before John for being
author of the same book, and that the priest confessed him self to had (...)
the thing for the love that he bare to Paul, and the book by reason thereof to
had escaped him. Some writers deem, that as often as Paul in his Epistles
says: according to my gospel, he signifies of the work of Luke, and that
Luke learned the gospel not only of the Apostle Paul, who had not been
conuersaunte with the Lord in the flesh, ^ut also of the rest of the
Apostles, which thing Luke himself also declares in the beginning of his
own work, saying: As they have delivered them unto us which from the
beginning saw themselves with their ^yes and were ministers of the things
that they declared. The gospel therefore he wrote as he had heard: but the
Acts of the Apostles he composed as he had seen. He lived.lxxxiiii. years not
having any wife. Buried he was at Constantinople, unto which (...) his bones
were removed and conveyed out of Achaia, together with the bones of Andrewe the
Apostle in the.ix. year of Constantius the Emperor.

The Paraphrase of Erasmus upon the Gospel of S. Luke.
The prologue.
For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth the declaracion of the
acts that are come to pass among us, like as they deliue^ed them unto us that
first saw them themselves, and were ministers of the word: I thought good
also (now that I had gotten the knowledge of all things from the beginning) to
write the^ diligently unto the in order, good Theophilus, to the end that
thou might know the truth of those woerdes, of the which thou art
enfourmed.
IN the histories of worldly affairs, upon consideracio^, that not a little,
as well delectacion as also profit, is taken of the knowledge of things: there
is customably required an upright truth of reporting the same. But much more
ought this upright truth to be in making relacion of the Gospel: the which
not only does much delight the mind having little else to do, or is very
commodious and profitable unto this transitory life: but also is necessary unto
true godliness, without the which no man atchiueth eternal salvation, and the
bliss that never shall decay of the life everlasting. For it were no matier of
daungier, though a man did not know what man Hannibal was, or Alexander:
what acts Epaminondas or Scipio has done: what mat^ers Solon, Lycurgus, or
Draco have written: what doctrine Socrates, Plato, or Aristotle taught, albeit
the knowleage of these things also, after the rate of man's state and case in
this world, has their fruit. But whatsoever person shall not know the
father, the son, and the holy ghost: whosoever shall not learn what acts
the soonne of God Jesus Christ has dooen on earth for the salvation of
mankind, what he has taught, what he has promised unto such as do
constauntely cleue to the doctrine of the gospel, what he has threatened unto
such persons as do either little regard, or else do plainly despise
the same: such an one shall not possibly be hable to avoid, but that being
excluded out of the coumpanye of Gods children, and shut out from the joys of
the heavenly life, he shall be adjudged with the wicked, to the torments of the
diepe pit of hell, which never shall have end.

And in deed at the first, by mean of thapostles being thereunto chosen of our
Lord himself, and by the residue of his disciples being enspired with the
holy ghost, the gospel (in deed by lively voice and by mouth only, but yet
with most upright certaintye and assured truth) is begone to be spread
abroad throughout all coasts and countries of the world, and does daily
yet still ferther and ferther run abroad. Yet forasmuch as the synceritie of
reportyng (the which going from man to man by mouth only issues
successiuelye to a great noumber) is more lightlye corrupted, then such
report as is set out and left from one to another in writing: therefore
Matthew the Apostle, one of the twelve, whom our Lord Jesus being yet
co^uersaunte on yearthe, had specially appointed and chosen to this office: and
also Mark the disciple of Peter the Apostle, were by inspiracion of the holy
ghost admonished to put the sum of the whole story of the gospel in
writing: not myndyng ne going about by preuencion to take away from others any
liberty to write of the same matiers: but rather, lest any person being
craftilye deceived by false Apostles should follow the Jews facions, or fond
fables instead of the gospel. Notwithstanding, like as not every manne did at
that time with eguall synceritie and pureness preach the gospel, so those
that write do not every man with like faythfulnesse and truth handle the
storye of the gospel. For many an one has attempted after like sort to
patche and to make a medley of the discourse of reportyng Christ's gospel, as
other writers are woonte of mortal men's acts: that is, entremedlyng
ofttymes false things among the true, and tellyng for matiers of approved
certainty, such things as they had before taken only of the uncertain
rumoures and voices of the common people, yea, and many times inuentyng of
their own brains some thing to tell, either of a delight and lust to lie, or
else being corrupted with some other affeccion. And (as mortal men's matiers
are of nature apt and ready to be corrupted) there shall perchance
hereafter also some persons sterte by, which through making lies on the acts
and doctrine of Christ and of his disciples, shall cause, that true matiers
shall not be credited neither. Therefore the spirit of Jesus has (as it were)
nipped my heart also with a litell twynge, that after Mathewe and Mark,
(which two with all possible truth and uprightness, wrote as much as at
that time they judged to be sufficient, and yet nevertheless of a set
purpose and entente, left unto others certain things to be written, supplying
in the mean time with the office of lively voice, that lacked in their
writings:) and after some others which have not with sembleable uprightness
attempted the same: of which persons some have every where entermyngled many
points much contrary to the doctrine of the gospel: and many have rather had
an iye to fill up the holes of the story with fables and tales vnseemyng for
the gravity of the gospel, then to tell such things as the holy ghost has
judged to be auailable toward the bliss everlasting: I Luke also should by
composyng a certain order and process of the story evangelical, both
supplye such matiers as have been omitted by the others, and also debar the
authority of other persons, which either heretofore have written, or
hereafter shall write for mattiers of certaynetie and for matiers of evident
truth, either fa^tasyes of their own imagining, or else things none otherwise
known but by the rumoure and brute of the people, who is commonly an author
and brynger up of things not all of the fynest. And yet do not we our selves
so frame the process of this story, that we leatte pass no manier point at
al of the things that have been said or done: But we make relacion of such
things only, as we know to concern the godly devotion of the gospel, and the
fruicion of the life everlasting. For an infinite and endelesse matier it were,
thoroughly to write every thing that Jesus has done or taught. Some points
there be, which without the prejudice of salvation may not be unknown,
some other things again there be, the knowelage whereof brings very much
profit to the zele and desire of perfect godliness: and some points finally
there be, that may be unknown without any peril of salvation, and
without any grievous empechemente or hinderaunce of a christen man's
perfeccion: as in deed (for an exaumple) all that ever we know in divine
matiers, Of the acts that are come to pass among us.
is but a little little portion, in respect and comparison of that that we know
not. Therefore neither will we touch and treat of every matier to the
vttermoste, nor yet tell or recite things uncertain: but those things only
will we declare, of which there has been most assured and evident certainty
showed unto us by the undoubted Apostles and disciples of Christ, the which
had not only theimselues with their own iyes seen a great part of the
things that they told unto us, and had heard the same with their own
ears, and had the handeling and doing of much part thereof with their own
hands: but also had theimselues been a part of the same acts that they
reported were done, as men that had done many things at the commandment of
the Lord, and had suffered not a few things for his sake, because they were
in all matiers inseparable companions and folowers of Jesus Christ, almost
never out of his presence. Neither ought there the less credit to be given
unto me, for that I do write such things, not as I have seen my self, but as
I have learned of others. It was requisite to a matier being so far out of
all use, and so strange, and so vnreedible: that feith should first be
acquired and woonne out of all the senses of the body, and than the same feith
to be confirmed with evident wondres and miracles.

But this kind of tokens or prouffes cannot evermore continue ne endure. For
on the one side Christ did not long exhibit himself to be seen in this
world, and on the other side miracles are things but for a time given to
me^nes hardness of belefe, That if mighie not be denied but that they had
seen heard and felt these things.
and afterward once to cease and to have an end. It is sufficient that the
rudimentes and first principles of the feith* proceeded from such beginninges
as these. Thomas the Apostle saw Christ after his resurreccion, heard him and
felt him with his hands, and than believed: but our Lord and master Christ
pronounces such persons to be blissed, which although they have not bodyly
seen the things dooen, yet nevertheless do give as much credit to the
words of the gospel, as if they had personally been present at the dooyng
of the same. For otherwise, if only the iyes should be believed, even very
they that were bodyly conuersaunt with our lord, do report many matiers, at
the dooyng of which themselves were not present, but learned it of other
persons being substanciall, credible, and true of their report: as (for an
exaumple) of the nativity and petigrewe of Christ, of the wise men that were
called Magi, (which came from the East to see Christ being new borne) of
the flying of Joseph and Marie with Christ into Egipte* of Satan how he tempted
Christ. We Evangelists, though we saw not the begynnynges of things, yet
have we seen the sequeles and ends of them. We have seen in the Apostles, all that ever our Lord had promised of them in the gospel. We have seen them
being enspired with the holy ghost, give the same holy spirit of God to other
persons also being baptized, by laying their hand over them: yea, and in our
own selves have we found and felt the effectual power and strength of the holy
ghost. We have seen diuilles drieuen out of me^ at the name of Jesus: we have
seen diseases put away: we have seen poisons void of al effect or force to
do harm. We have seen that the majesty of the gospel, by men of slendre
substance in worldely richesse, by men of low degree borne, by men private,
that is to say, by men having no seculare authority at al, is yet
nevertheless in a few years famously notified throughout the whole universal
earth, and that the great and mighty princes of the world have in vain
striued and wrastled to suppress it.

And verayly even the same thing also, had our Lord spoken before and
prophesied: when I shall be lifted up from the earth (said he) I shall draw
all things to my self. Such autours and auouchers of things, and the
growyng of the same things to such an end and proof as before is said, does
not suffer us to doubt, neither of tho things that have passed before our
time, ne yet of such things, as for many hundredes of years to come are
promised. Whatsoever had of long time before been foresayed by the godly
sayings of the prophets, Jesus at his cummyng into the world did perform
and fulfill: and whatsoever thing Christ toward his departure from hence up to
heaven, said before to thapostles that it should come to pass, has in deed
come to pass: neither is it to be doubted, but that he will with semblable
uprightness and truth, accomplish all other things, which he has
differred vn^y^l his second coming to be performed, concerning the
resurreccion of our bodies, and concerning the rewards of the godly persons,
and of the wicked. Therefore as for the order and process of the gospel
matiers, I have with earnesse study thoroughly bou^ted out of the mouths of
such, whose words are undoubted and certain to write upon. And out of these
have I pieked such points as seemed to be most effectual and most helpyng
to the faith, and to the devout godliness of the gospel: not geuyng it but a
little touch here and there as it were at nouers, and as men gather flowers
here and there one, at aue^ture as they come to hand: but following the order of
the time, and the due course or process of matiers, I have diligently compyled
the storye, yea even somewhat far fettyng the matier from the first ground,
that is to wete from the concepcion of him, which went before the coming of
our salueour, like as in birth, so in preaching also, and in death. And than
furthermore I treat of the strange concepcion of Christ within the womb of
the virgin, of the birth of the child, of his circumcision, of the
puri^icacion of Marie, of so^drie prophecies spoken upon the child, and of
certain tokens of godly towardness which even very than already did like
certain little sparks appear in the child: of which things the other
Evangelists that with upright truth and certainty wrote before, had touched
almost nothing at all. After all this, how John baptized and preached, and than
of the baptising of Jesus, of his being tempted, of his doctrine, of wondres
that he wrought, of his death, of his being laid in grave, of his arisyng
again from death to life, and of his returnyng up into heaven. These things
well set in an order each in his most convenient place, I shall in another
treatise add, In the acts of the apo^^les.
how he sent the holy ghost, and what were the first rudimentes and
principles of the primitive church when it first came v^, and begone, and
also as it grew from time to time greater and greater, what the chief
Apostles Peter, James, Paul, and Barnabe did, what they taught, by what
miracles, and by what affliccions they glorified the name of our Lord Jesus,
not for that I suppose that these things will be strange unto thee, most
honest Theophilus, but partelye to the entente that thou may eftesones
peruse in an order tho things which thou haste by piecemele learned of
others: and partelye to the end that thou may of a more perfect, and assured
credence, thoroughly perceive by my writing, the same things, which thou
had heard of others before times by their liuelye voice, and word of
mouth, and may refuse the fablinges of a great sort which do at this
present, under the false counterfeicte name of the gospel, set out their own
peynted sheath: Theophilus i^ Greek is in english the lover of god.
and not thou alone, o Theophilus, (for we do not write these things to any
one sole person only) but also all other persons, either at this present
time being, or hereafter to come, which either be or shall be the same in deed,
that thou art called in name, that is to wete, the lovers of god: which
renouncyng and vttrely geuyng up the devil, do with pressed readiness of
beleuyng, and with godly applying theimselues, sue to the frendeship of god:
and the which despising as well the eiuilles as also the good things of this
transitory world, do bend al their desire to those things, that are
everlasting and heavenly.

The first Chapter.
When the time by the purpose and appoyntemente of God prefixed, and by
soondrye sage sawes of the Prophets afor^tolde and promised, and by the space
of so many hundred years, greatly wished for of holy and devout people, was now
come, that the son of God should take upon him the nature of man, for to
redeem mankind by his death, and as well by his doctrine as also by his
exaumple of doing, for to enstructe us toward the knowledge of the truth,
and the earnest love and desire of the godly trade of the gospel, and
finally by his promyses for to set up our hertes toward the hope of the life
everlasting in heaven: for because all this same that was to be done was
strange, nor the like heard of, in any age or time before, (the wisdom of god
by secret ways and means ordreyng all things) there was leate pass no
point at all of any tokens or evident signs, which might to a matier of it
self incredible, purchase credit, and cause it to be believed among men. For
who has ever heard a man to have been borne of a woman on earth, which should
for evermore reign God in heaven? The histories even of the Gentiles also be
full of strange things that have happened against the common course of
nature. In the books of the old testament we learn that fire has been cast
down from heaven: we learn the sea to have opened and divided it self into
two parts: water to have been gotten forth of a dry stone by touching it
with a long rod, and dead men to have been restored again to life. But
who has ever heard a virgin to have brought forth a child without man's
help? Yet in deed the chief article of our salvation it was, that this same
point were to all persons thoroughly persuaded, that is to wete, Jesus to be
the same Messiah, whose cummyng, all foretellynges of the Prophets had
promised, and whom all the laws of Moses had by way of a shadow expressed,
and of whom only all persons must hope and trust to have their salvation.

Wherefore by the high wisdom and providence of god, there was one prepared,
the which being for his own part also borne into this world after a
wonderful strange sort, should go before the heavenly child bearing of
the virgin Marie: and the which through the nobleness of his lineage, through
such his holiness of living as had not before that time been heard of, and by
his authority, through his rare gifts of grace gotten among all the people,
might unto Christ being not yet borne, procure the first knoweleage and faith
among the Jews which were hard of belief even as the doctrine of the gospel
(whereof Christ was the head, the first founder, and first brynger up) was at
the first beginning made acceptable unto the world, by the testimonye of the
old law, the figure of the which old law, Zachary and John did represent.
But in short process of time, (the course of things being changed a
contrary way) like as Christ when his virtues and gifts of grace were showed
forth, did derken the glory of John: so the brightness of the majesty of
the gospel, as soon as it once opened it self unto the world, did (as ye
would say) clean abrogate the authority of Moses law. And so it was that
where Jacob the Patriarch a little before he should dye, being endowed with the
spirit of prophecy, did foresaye very many things which should afterward
come to pass, when it was now come to the mencioning and namyng of Judah, (out
of whose tribe our Lord Jesus should issue and proceed by lineall dissent) he
spoke these words of the prophecy, following. The scepter (said he) shall not
be taken from Judah, ne the head tewler from the thighe of him, until he come
that must be sent, and very he shall be the expectacion of all nations. This
prophecy did evidently enough betoken that Messiah should at such time come,
when the people of the Jews (which had before from time to time evermore been
rewled and governed by capitaynes, judges, kings, and priests of their own
nation) should now be subject to a prince borne in a foreyne countreye. And
the same Prophecy did al under one give a toke^, that the grace of the gospel
(which the Jews would despise and set at naught) should pass and go from
them unto the Gentyles. Of Herod the king.
But first of all others, Herod the son of Antipater, whereas he was
neither descended of the blood of the Jews, and yet was besides^orth an
ungodly and a wieked person, was not only enfraunchised and called to the
honor to be a denisen of the country of Iewrie, but also through the favor
of Ceasar Augustus than Emperor of Rome, obtained the kingdom and rewle over
the Jews. Therefore even up this token alone (though there had been no mo, nor
no other) the Scribes and the Pharisees, (which took upon them the exact and
perfect knowleage of the law,) might have geassed, that the time was now come,
when that same man should be borne, who defacyng and vanquishyng all terrene
or yearthly kingdoms, should bring into the world an heavenly kingdom, and
which in the place and stead of tyrannes, should create pastors, and instead
of lordely masters, should make te^dre fathers. Furthermore whereas the
dignity of the Iudaical priesthood was in excedyng high honor and in
wondreful estimacion among al persons: the holy ghost had by the prophets
declared before, that this priesthood also of the Jews should be abrogated and
abolished, after that he were once come, the which not being enoynted by men
with material or bodily oil, but being enoynted by God in spirit with the
oil celestial, should through a sacrifice (being in deed no mo but one sole
sacrifice, A certain priest.
but the same nevertheless a sacrifice of most absolute efficacy and virtue)
take away all the sins of the world: and should through the feyth of the
gospel, and the bounteous geuyng of the spirit of God, sanctify and make
holy all things. For Daniel had prophesied, Daniel. ix.
that after the weeks or seven doubles of years, that is to say, after seven
times seven years by God prefixed, it should come to pass, that the holy of
all holyes should be enoincted, and than from thenceforth should the hosts and
sacrifices of the old law cease. When the things eternal shall be once
come, things transitorye shall have an end: when ghostely things shall be
come, things carnal shall cease: when the truth shall be come, feyned
counterfeytes shall give place: when the light shall be come, shadows and
darkness shall vanishe away: when Christ shall have begone to speak, the
voice of the gross law shall play mum, until that it too, do openly
profess him, whom until now, it did rather (as who should say) with certain
tokens of becking, nod at, or point unto, the^ by express words pronounce
and declare to be he. At such time therefore as Herod, being first a foreinour
and an aliene borne, and secondarily a wicked person, and with many
manslaughters and heinous murders, polluted, had all under his rewle and
obeisaunce among the Jews, not by the authority of God, but by the favor of
Ceasar Augustus: and at what time the religion of the Iewishe temple, which
consisted in external figures and ceremonies, did most chiefly of all
flourishe among men: at what time extreme wickedness and all ungodly facions
did before the face of God reign among the Scribes, the Phariseis, the elders,
and the bishops, under the false pretensed color and cloak of holiness: even
than did the coming of the Lord Jesus, after this sort as we shall now tell,
begin first to be known to the world. Named zachary.
There was under a wicked king a godly priest, even (as ye would say) the
last remains that was left of the old order of priestehood, not being yet
corrupted with so many vices: this priests name was Zachary, whom the order of
lottes cu^ming about again by course, did at that present time call to the
ministryng of the sacres and holy rites in the temple. For so had David sorted
all the whole order of priests into two principal families, that is to wete,
of Eleasar, and of Ithamar. The other families being subject unto these two, he
divided into four and twenty lottes, that every of them in order one after
an other, should in their courses minister the sacres in the temple, eight
days space a piece: absteining all that while from all things, which by the
rites of Moses prescripcion, seemed to make a man unclean: refrayning also from
cumpanying with their wives, nor cumming once within their own house, but
abydyng still in the temple, to the end that they might with the more
chastity and with the more purity handle the service of God: but to all the
residue of the priests (besides him whose course it was to minister for that
week) it was lefull in the mean space to attend to their wives and their
children, and to be occupied about their own secular affairs, so that it were
things necessary and requisite to be done. And so it was, that while this
order was thus in dividing by lottes, among the four and twenty families, the
eight place fell by lotte to Abia, of whom zacharye was lineally descended, and
into whose place Zachary had by course succeeded. Of ye course of Abia.
All thissame, though it seemed to be done by mere chaimce at adventure, yet was
there no one point thereof, but it was wrought by the high wisdom and
providence of God, yea not so much as the very number of the course, but it
was for a purpose and a consideracion. For like as the number of seven for many
causes has the figure and significacion of the old law, so does the number
of eight well accord to the grace of the ghospel, for as much as the
everlasting bliss of heaven is now given, not through the works of the law,
but freely and frankly through feith. And his wife of the daughters of Aaron.
And Zachary had also a wife named Elizabeth, not only the better to be
esteemed for the respect of her noble birth (for she came of ye stock and
blood of Aaron the first priest of the people of Israel) but also worthy to
be had in reverence and wurship for her integrity and perfect goodness of
behaueour, to the intent that such an holy man as Zachary was, should not be
without a wife according.

For it was in very deed an holy wedlock knitte and made up, not so much by
copulacion of their bodies, as by likeness of their minds and hertes, and by
the fellowship of godliness, because they were both of them very good folks and
just, not with the justice of the Phariseis (which Phariseis under a false
couiour and counterfaite show of holiness, did set forth their prynted
sheathe to the iyes of men for lucre and for worldely praise, defourmyng their
faces and making them unsightly for the nons, a troumpette blowyng before them,
at all such times when they gave their alms, sekyng to be esteemed holy by
reason of long prayers made in corners of the streets, when their heart was
drouned in all fylthinesse of heinous offenses and trespaces against God: They
were both righteouse before God.
) but Zachary and Elizabeth with vncorrupt hertes, did in such wise observe
and keep all things which the Lord had commanded by the law: that neither
they gave unto men any hold or title to find fault with them, and yet (the
which is a point of no small difficulty) they did also by the purity and
clenesse of their living, show themselfes pleasyng in the sight of God. Yea
and this very point also was wrought by the high wisdom of God, of a
special provision, to the end that such a one as should afterward give
testimony unto Christ at his cumming, might on his own behalf be in all
manner degrees worthy acceptacion among the people of the Jews: first, for the
nobleness of his lineage being descended of the order of priesthood as well on
the fathers side as on the mothers side: secondarily for the linyng of both his
parents being unreprovable: thirdly for the virtues and gifts of grace in his
own self, being wonderful, and such as were but in few persons to be
found: and finally for his glorious death, when he should suffer for the
truths sake. Such a cryar verily it was mete yt he should have, which came to
allure to himself the whole world, with the savor, as it were, of the good
fame and opinion that should spryng of him. Ferthermore by the providence of
God, this point alo was wrought, that the strange manner of his nativity
should stiere up the minds of men to have a special regard of John: And they
had no child.
and no such common matiers or facions as were in other folks to be looked
for at his hand, the which was borne into this world not after the common
course of nature, but by the only benefit of God. For although the holy
conversation of zachary and Elizabeth was specially well approved and allowed
of all persons: yet in this one point their godliness seemed to have but hard
hap, that both of them were very far growe^ in age without having any
issue or child in all their time. For among the Jews like as the
fruitfulness of matrimony was reputed for a certain thing of great Royalty:
so was barainnesse in as much reproach as any thing, and was rekoned in the
number of the chief missehappes and evils of this lyre. For the most part of
the people did interpret and take those persons to be rejected and cast out
of the favor of God, which had not had the fortune and hap, with some kind
of issue to increase and multiply the people of the Jews, being a people
specially chosen and dedicate unto God. For the Jews being altogether gross
and carnal, had not yet learned, that a spiritual and ghostely people it was,
which God would have by an heavenly generation still from time to time more
and more to be multiplied with continual succession of issue. They had not yet
heard that blissed were tho persons, which had gelded themselfes for the
kingdom of heaven. Because Elizabeth was barai^.
And this mattier did not a little grieve them both in their minds, and
especially Elizabeth, who was now even already by a much reprochefull name in
every bodies mouth called baraine, and was rekoned in the number of women of
hard hap, as one of such barainesse, that she was now past all lykelyhood
or hope to have any child, because that very many years having passed in the
coumpanie of her wedded house band, And they both were now well stricken in
age.
she had yet brought forth no fruit of matrimony. For the reproach of
barainnesse is wont most specially to light on the women. And this despair
of having any child, the old age of them both had increased. But the bounteous
goodness of God, did of tender favor give unto the devout prayers and
desires of their hertes, that thing which the strength and power of nature did
not give to the coumpanying of their bodies.

Therefore when zachary executed the office of the priest in the order of his
course, When he executed.
which (as we have said) was in the course of Abia: and continuing within the
temple in the sight of God, attended the ministryng of the sacres, like a pure
and a chaste man: and now according to the custom and manner, there was one to
be chosen to go into the innermoste and priuiest place of the temple (which is
called Sancta sanctorum, Before god
that is to say, the holy of holyes, or the principal holy place) the chance
of the lotte so fell, that he was chosen to enter into the principal holy
place, His lotte fell to burn incense.
(which it was not leefull for any person to enter except the bishop, or such
an one as were appointed in the bishops stead) and there, on the altar that
stood in the secret inner part of the temple, to lay holy incense made of
certain sweet odoures in the old law appointed, that is to wete, of balm,
onycha, sweet galbanum, and frankyncense of the clerest sort. For this kind
of sacrifice was esteemed among the Jews to be the most holy above all others,
Exodus xxx d
insomuche that to the seeing of this sacrifice when it was in doing, the lay
people were not admitted to come in, no nor yet any of the levites neither. But
all the residue besides the priest that did execute, tarried without, being
separated and divided from that place with a veil, And ye multitude of the
people were without in prayer.
making their devout prayers all the mean while, that God would vouchesalue to
ratify that, that was than in offering for the health and safegarde of the
whole people: and so remained they without, until the priest after the
sacrifice in the inner place co^pleted, came forth again to the people, to
finish the residue of things, which to the ordenarie obsequies and rites of
sacrifice did apperteine. And the priest did not only pray for the people, but
also for himself, according unto the prescripcion of the law, as one being a
mortal man himself as well as the others, and in danger of falling into the
errors and vices of this world.

Therefore whereas zachary had many years before often times with most earneste
desires, cried unto God to deliver as well his wife from the reproach of
barrainesse, as also himself from the grief and pensifnesse of being without
issue: yet (notwithstanding a certain despair of having any children many a
day sense conceived in his mind,) he did even at that present time with most
ardent prayers, require of God as though he had than been present before his
face, the public rede^pcion of the people, which had now many hundred years
been looked for. And in deed the fume of the incense mounting up from the
altar, was cast abroad in the aier on every side, but the desire of this
devout bishop, perced up even to God, the Angels carrying it, whose office
it is to conueigh up to almighty God the prayers of the godly, and again to
bring down to us his bounteouse largess. There appeared unto him an Angel.
An Angel therefore that had been sent from heaven, stood at the right end
of the altar, on which the sweet savors of incense was burned, as one ready
to declare some glad tydinges (because things that chance to be on the
ryghtsyde, have commonly a luckie significacion of some good hap to come.
When Zachary saw him, he was abashed, and fear came upon him.
) Zachary, when he had soodainly espied this Angel shynyng with celestial
brightness (for he came not in openly in a bodily form as men use to do, but
soodainly and unware showed himself visible) truly he was sore dismayed in his
mind, and taken with a great fear: not that the Angel made a show of any
manner thing to be feared, but for that the infirmity of man's body is not
able to abide the majesty of the spirits or Angels of heaven.

But like as it is a point of man's weakness to fall in a tremblyng and
quakyng at the soodaine sight of an Angel, so is it the property of the
great goodness of them, with ientle and familiar speaking unto us, to take
away our fear. And the Angel said.
The Angel therefore with a gracious look, and with ientle fair words
speaking unto zachary, said in this wise: zachary, there is no cause why thou
should be afeard, but there is cause why thou may be glad and joyful.
For I bring glad tydinges both unto thee, and to all the people for whom thou
art now making intercession. God has granted thy devout and godly peticion.
Fear not. Thy prayer is heard.
The Same Messiah the deliverer and sauer of his people, which long and many
days gonne has been promised, and many hundred years already looked for, is
now at hand to come in deed. And not only that thing which thou haste made
peticion for is obtained: but an other thing also does the goodness of God
add to the heap of thy desires, which thing thou durst not be so bold to
ask, Thy wife Elizabeth shall bear a son.
because thou were now clean out of all hope that it might by any
possibility come to pass. Thou made peticion for the redemer of the world:
thou shall receive also, one that shall declare and publyshe the redemer unto
the world.

The fruitefulnesse of thy wife Elizabeth that has been hitherto by the
wisdom and providence of God delaied and put of, shall bring unto the no small
increase of joys: and a general gladness of all the people, shall be coupled
with the particular rejoicing of thine own private householde* Her
fruitefulnesse that all folk despaired of, shall have a commodity, and do
good for this purpose, that all persons may understand thissame child
bearyng not to be of the common rate, but the child which shall be borne, to be
borne God being the worker and dooer of it. In deed thy wife shall bring forth
to thee a child, but she shall not bring forth child to thee alone: she shall
bring forth to the whole people in general: she shall bring forth to God, by
who^e providence all this matter every whyt of it is tempered and wrought. So
much the more to the wondre of the world shall she bring forth, that it is so
far past time of her age ere she bring forth: so much the more to the
pleasyng and reioycyng of all parties, that she had no such hope: so much the
more to her good hap and fortune, that she shall bring forth a son, and not
a son at all adventures, but the great publisher, and foregoer, and (as who
should say) the husher and maker of way, and the purseuaunt of the most great
Messiah that is to come. And thou shall call his name John.
To the office of such an high preeminence, is he by the free and frank
favor of God, pieked out and deputed, and for that cause shall thou call his
name John, that the people may even thereby at least wise be advertised, that he
shall be very well accepted of God, and plenteously heaped with many heavenly
gifts of grace. Therefore the sorrow which the barainnesse of thy wife has
hitherto brought unto thee, shall be redubbed with plentiful joy, and with
much rejoicing. Neither shall this joy be kept or enclosed within the walls or
precinct of thine own house. And thou shall have joy. etc.
There shall at thy joy a great many of thy friends rejoice, which were
sorowefull before for thy sorrow. There shall leap for joy at the birth of thy
son, all such as do thirst the cummyng of Messiah. This Messiah being as it
were the sun in the sky, thy son shall go before as it were a certain day
sterre, to give knowlage before by his wonderful brightness, that the arisyng
of him is even at hand, which shall on every side, put away the derkenesse of
all the whole universal world. In deed the other shall be out of all
comparison most greatest, but yet thy son too, like as he shall be much
inferior to the other: so shall he in dignity excel and pass all the rest
of the other Prophets that hitherto have been. For he shall in very deed be
great, not only in the opinion of men, but also in the iyes of the Lord, unto
whom no man is great, but by the virtues and gifts of grace which himself
does frankly give. For he shall be great, not in worldly richesse and
ruffleyng port of this life, or in worldely dominion, but rather by the
contempt and despisyng of those things, which make certain persons great in
the iyes of men. And the less that he shall desire the commodities or wealth of
this world, somuche the more plenteously shall he be couched full of gooddes
heavenly.

And as for all kind of excessive or delicate fedyng, Wine and strong drink
shall he no^ drink (...)
withal the other obiectacions and pleasures of the body, he shall so much
abhor, that he will not at any time drink any wine, or any other delicious
or strong drink, ne any liquour at all, that is hable to take away so briete
from a man, or to distemper his brain. For these filthy delites of
sensuality have no place in such an one, in whose breast the holy ghost has
taken possession before to dwell in: which holy ghost shall replenishe the mind
and soul of thy son even while he lies secret within the enclosure of his
mothers womb, that he may play the part of a Prophet in gesture, before he
be able to have any vtteraunce of words by speaking. And in short process of
years, when the gifts of the spirit of God shall have grown as his years and
age shall do, he shall work wondres: on the one side, by the exaumple of his
most holy life, and on the other side, through such his preaching as men
shall maruayle at. For (according to the prophecy of Malachias, Many of ye
children of Israel shall be turn to their Lord.
) many of the children of Israel being fallen from the favor of God, (by
reason that while they bearyng themselfes bold on the carnal law, took no
regard to do those things, which the figures of the law do signify) he
shall convert to their Lord God, preaching with great frankenesse and
plainness, the kingdom of God to be at hand: exhortyng them to the
repentaunte emendyng of their former life: making withoutwarde baptisyng in
water, a foreprofer to the abolishyng of sin, which abolishing of sin was
to come through Messiah: and finally unto all persons openly showing that same
manne, whom God for this purpose would shortly after send into the world, that
by him alone and only, everlasting salvation should come unto all men. And he
shall go before him. etc.
Thissame Messiah shall first come as a poor humble man of low degree, to the
end that he may confer and give everlasting salvation unto all persons
putting their trust and affiaunce in him. Then afterward shall he eftsoon
come in majesty to give rewards unto every one according to their deeds, that
is to were, to the good and the godly everlasting life, and to the unbelieving
and wiked persons everlasting death. And like as by Malachias prophecy, Mala.
iiii.
Helias shall be the foremessagier of his second cumming, to prepare the hearts
of me^ by his preaching, against that same great and terrible day of the
Lord; right so shall thy son be the foremessagier of the former cummyng, in
which God by his son Messiah, shall descend down into the earth, to lure
and provoke all persons in general without excepcion, by John's preaching, unto
the knowledge and love of himself. And for this point he shall of a great
many, he thought to be Helias. Neither shall he without good cause be said to
be Helias, To turn ye hearts of the fathers unto the children.
in that he shall in the spirit and power of Helias come before the cummyng of
the Lord, to the end that (as the Prophet Malachias has written) he may
turn the hearts of the fathers to the children: whereby the Jews, who have so
far growe^ out of kind and fallen from the holy trade of their forefathers,
may amend, and come again to better grace: and that the same Jews beleuyng in
the words of Messiah (by whom God shall speak unto them) may truly deserve
to be called the children of Abraham, in that they follow the prompte
readynesse of beleuyng, which was in Abraham: and also that such persons, as
while they cleave fast to the outward rynde or bark of the law, do not
understand the mind and effectual pith of the law, he may convert and bring
unto the wisdom of the just, which have learned, that under the utter
plaster or pergetyng of the law, there lies hydden some higher point, and
some holyer matter, the which shall ere long, be uttered abroad by the
preaching of Messiah, who shall perfeitely accomplish and fulfill the law in
the right kind as it ought to be, but thy son being as a way leader unto
the heavenly preaching of thissame Messiah, shall prepare the hearts of men,
that he may deliver up unto Messiah at his cumming, To make ready a perfe^ct
people unto the Lord.
a people not utterly vntraded or vnentred in his discipline, but somewhat
prepared already, and instructed thereunto with the agnisyng and knowledgyng of
their own sinfulness, with the expectacion of the kingdom of heaven, and with
feling a great miss and lack of the Messiah to come. For so was it thought
best unto almyghtye God, by castyng first of all, certain entreinges and
principles, to bring man, which had been fallen to utter ignorance and
wickedness, a little and a little by degrees, up to the highest points of godly
perfeccion.

The Angel vsyng all thissame frendely talk, zachary has now put away
the fear that he was in. But forbecause it were great high points that the
Angel promised, and by course of nature, not credible: Zacharye both after
the manner and use of the Jews, and also representyng a figure of their
Synagoge, requires to have some matter of weight to be annexed to the
promises, by some euidente token, to the end that one miracle should obtain
assured credit unto an other. Wherefore he answered, and spoke, unto the
Angel in this sort. By what present token now out of hand may I know,
that thissame which thou do promise to come, is a matter of perfeite
certayntie? For I am old and my wife is well strieken in age. etc.
For otherwise the very felyng of nature says the contrary. For I for my
part am already a very aged man: and my wife also is already over far
strieken in years, to have any child bearing hoped for of her body. How shall
that thing now chance unto me and her, being both of us old and past having
any fruit, the which did not chance unto us when we were young, and in
perfeite lustiness of our bodies? Then said the Angel again: If a mortal
man being sent from another mortal man should promise unto the such things
as these, thou might well, and not without good cause, doubt of the promise.
For I grant that thissame thing, which I promise, is above man's power, and
above the common order and course of nature. But neither is it possible for an
Angel to bring a message of vanity, nor any thing there is so incredible
among men, but that God can easily perform it unto them, that believe in his
promises.

For I am the same Angel Gabriell, I am Gabriell that stand i^ the presence
of God.
many years gone, sent to the Prophet Daniell, the which from time to time
do stand in the sight of God, among the seven pryncipall seruitours of heaven,
in a readynesse to do all manner obedient service at the will and pleasure of
God: and at this present time especially deputed and appointed by God unto this
office, to be the messagier between God and man in this present matter, then
the which, never was there at any time any other act done, more greatter, or
more to be meruayled at. Therefore that thou may not be in any manner
distruste, it is God that is the maker of this promise: and I the messagier
sent from the same, to make rela^ion of the matter unto thee, and to bring thee
glad tidings.

And sense thou dooest so much require, thou shall have given unto thee, And
behold thou shall be dumme.
that shall both be a true token of the promise in time cummyng to be
performed, and also a punishemente for thy mystrustfulnes at this present
declared. Behold, thou shall soodainly, eue^ from this instant become dumme,
nor shall not have power to bring a word out of thy mouth, until thy son
being borne into this world, shall have discharged my credit and promise, of
the which there ought not any doubt to have been made on thy behalf. For the
time is now at hand, that the Synagoge which is so hard to be brought to
belefe, shall keep silence, and no persons shall have tongue to speak with at
liberty, saving only such as with ready towardnes to believe, shall obey and
follow the preaching of the gospel.

While these things were in doing between Zachary and the Angel, within the
innermoste tabernacle of the temple, all the whole body of the people stood
awayting and lokyng, that the priest should come forth according as the manner
was, to execute and ministre the rest of the rites that were yet to be done
abroad in the presence of the multitude. And truly they were strieken in a
great wonder, that he made such tarying in the tabernacle a longer space, then
the wont use was. At length forth cummeth zachary, with a countenance in
deed, showing an vnwoonte gladness, but the use of his speech clean taken from
him. By the which things the people rightwell understood, that some vision
had appeared unto him while he was within. For the presence and being together
with any part of the majesty of God, or with any Angel of heaven, is wont
to make a great alteracion in the state and mood of a mortal man's face and
countenance, as in old time it chanced also unto Moses. And when he had no
power to speak with his tongue, he wrought by signs and tokens of poyntyng
and noddyng with his head, which was, that the sacrifice had been done to the
contentacion of God, and that God was highly pleased therewith, and that they
should therefore render thanks unto him, in that he had graciously heard the
devout prayers of his servants.

And then did zachary (even dumme as he was) remain still within the temple
executyng his office in ministryng the sacres, until the number of his eight
days were completed and ended. The people of the Jews, all that mean while
during, had a priest that could not speak, as an incling and a token of the
law in short process of time afterward to cease, and to give place unto
him, which bryngyng the truth abroad to light, should put away all
shadows of things, and make them to vanishe.

And after those days his wife.
But the ordinary time of his ministryng in the temple being expired, zachary
returned home to his own house: and there, upon confidence and trust of the
Angels promise, he enbraced his baraine and aged wife Elizabeth. For here in
this case, there was no geuyng of themselves to the wanton desire of the
flesh, but great lack and desire there was of ye child which should bring the
glory of God to light and knowledge by his life, and his preaching: and which
should be the foregoer of him, who having been a long season looked for, should
at last bring perfeite salvation unto all creatures. Chaste enbracinges of the
housebande and wife it is, which the promise of God does couple, and not
wanton lust of the body. An holy compaynying together of man and wife it is,
that seeks nothing else, but the fruit of issue: and godly is the love and
desire of such issue, as is borne, not to our own pleasures and appetites,
but to the public benefit and wealth of all creatures. And she hid her self
five months.
Now when Elizabeth had according to the Angels promise, conceived: she hid
her self out of company, keeping the matter close from the sight of the
people, by the space of five months, in deed no less than a glad woman, that
she was conceived with child, but yet (as virtuous disposicion and
shamefastnes commonly go together) more then half ashamed, for because that to
such persons, as did not yet know all thissame matter to be done, God being
the worker and doer of it, she being now already an aged woman, might seem to
had wholly given herself yet still unto the satisfying of the wanton lust of
her body. For she was not ignoraunte, how much inclined the most part of
folks are, as well to misdeme the wurst, as also to speak naughtily. And the
prudent mind of the woman, had also a ferther iye, and regard unto this
point too, that there was no vauntes ne braggues to be made among the people,
of the gift of God, Saying: thus has the Lord delte with me.
until it were assuredly past all doubts: lest, if the thing had afterward
quailled, or gone away in any behalf, the reproach of her baraines should be
double, for that being so fer strieken in years she had conceived such a vain
hope to have a child. Nevertheless, when by sundry assured tokens, she
perfeitely knew herself to be with child, she did in such wise at all times
show herself glad of her happy chance, that all this matter every whit of
it, what soever it were, she referred unto the only goodness of God. I have
hitherto (says she) been diffamed with the reprochefull name of a baraine
woman, and one that never should have child, among the people of Israel, in
whose opinion the barainnes of the body is a thing of more dishonestie and
shame, then naughty disposicio^ of the mind. But the Lord (I see well) has
for this purpose made a delay of my fruitfulness, In ye days wherein he has
looked upon me. etc.
that a child borne now when no man looked for it, not only might deliver me
from the reproach of barainnes, but also should cause unto me the more aumple
joy. For plainly the free gift of God it is, who at such time as best pleased
himself, has vouchedsafe to cast a favorable iye on me his simple handmaide,
in such sort, that by reason of my child (though being but one alone, and
borne when it was almost past season, yet nevertheless a child specially to be
marked and regarded) whom I have borne in Gods behalf, I shall from hencefurth
in folks communicacion be reported to be a mother much happier then a great
many of others, the which do with a great sort of children a piece, enriche
their housebandes.

These things thus done, it remained, that the holier and greater piece of
this mystery, should be procured by the Angel, that is to wete, that the
son of God being God immortal, should of a virgin, being a creature
subject unto death, be borne a man mortal: the like whereof never had before
sense the creacion of the world been heard, And in the sixth month was ye
Angel Gabriell sent from God.
ne to the last end of the world again should be heard. Therefore when the
time from without beginning by God prefixed, drew nere, that God the father
would by his son deliver the whole universal world from the tyranny of
death and of sin: he sent the selfsame Angel Gabriell, as a broker or
procurer and a maker up of this godly copulacion andioynyng with the said
virgin. And this was done in the sixth month after that Elizabeth was
conceived with John. Unto this heavenly matter there was specially deputed a
tender young virgyn, not set forth to the world with aboundau^ce of riches or
possessions, not by famousnes of name, not with portlynesse of life, ne with
the other things which this world uses to have in high regard: but endued
with excellent virtues of the mind, the which do make a man acceptable in
the sight of God: that is to say, with purity of life undefiled, with
maidenly demurenes, and with godly devotion. Her habitacion was in an homely
basse little town of Galile called Nazareth, Into a city of Galile. etc.
a people nothing regarded ne set by among the Jews. And the virgin was
espoused unto a man of no fame ne port in any behalf to the worlds
estimacion: but for his virtues of the mind, a man to be accepted before God, a
carpenter by occupacion, and his name Joseph, being lineally descended of the
stock of David, from the which stock of David, the espoused virgin also had
her progeny, to the end that the case might not disagree with the prophecy,
which had promised that Messiah should be borne of the stock of David king of
Israel. And the name of the virgin was Mary. God had for the nons picked out
two persons of low degree and of small port, to thentent that the world
might not in this heavenly matter, claim or challenge to it self any point or
part thereof. He had also pieked out persons of most faultlesse and most pure
behavior, to the end that no point of crime might be laid to their charge.
And the name of the virgin was Marie.
He had pieked out persons coupled together in chaste and leefull matrimony,
to thentent partly that the priuetie of a child to be borne by a pure virgin
might be secret until the due time thereof: and partly that the case being
otherwise vnbeleuable, (which was, that a virgin had without coumpaynying with
any manne brought forth a child,) might not lack a witness convenient. At a
time when this virgin was in her contemplacion within her privy closet (as
virginity loves to be secret) the Angel Gabriell apperyng visible with
much bryghtnes came in unto her, and hayled her with a strange sort of
salutacion. Hail thou full of grace.
Rest thou well (says he) and rejoice, o virgin being full of grace, and
highly in favor. Thou have the Lord right favorable unto thee, and much thy
friend. And therefore shall thou be siggularly renoumed, and of a laudable name
among all women.

But the virgin, at the sudden sight of the Angel, and again also at the
form and tenor of his salutacion being strange and such as never had been
heard of before, forasmuch as she on her own behalf conceived no great
opinion of her self, was right much dismayed in her mind. For that she was
fore adrad at the entreyng of one in the likeness of a young man not looked
for, was a point of a certain very true maidenly and tender shamefastness:
that she made not answer out of hand, but cast with herself in her mind,
what thing so strange and so high a salutacio^ might mean, was partly a
point of wisdom, And the Angel said unto her* Fear not Mary. etc.
and partly of demure softness. But forasmuch as the Angel right well
knew what she was casting in her mind, he would not suffer her any longer to
stand in doubt or perplexity: but both took away her fear with speaking
ientely unto her, and also declared at large the cause of that his vnquod and
strange gretyng. Mary (says he) there is no cause why thou should be
afeard. The jewel of thy virginity and maydenhood, which thou art sigularly
in love withal, is safe unto the without any danger of lesyng it. Neither am
I come to please the, or to set the agog with a vain salutacion: but I am come
unto the as a messagier of a matter both passing joyful, and also very great.
Ponder not thine own deserts. Of the mere favor of god it is that is offered
unto the, and not of thine own merit. And even in this very point thou
do please God, that thou stand in no conceipte of thy self. And let this
suffice the, that thou haste atteyned grace and favor at Gods hand. And now
harken a thing never heard before, Behold, thou shall conceive in thy womb.
but yet a true thing. Thou shall conceive a babe in thy womb, and shall bring
forth a son, and shall call his name Jesus, because he shall bring salvation
unto his people.

And although he shall be borne in an homely place, and of a maiden esteemed to be
of low degree: Yet by reason of his heavenly gifts of grace, he shall every
way be most greatest: insomuche, that after he shall once be known to the
world, he shall be called, not by the name of a Prophet, but the son of the
highest. The surname shall be greater then any other manne may have,
forbecause the child that must be borne, shall far surmounte the common rate
and degree of mortal man's state. In this child certes will the Lord God
perform and accomplish the thing, which the prophecy, being to thee not
unknown, has promised. A man borne of the stock of David shall sit in the
throne of his father. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.
He shall not through the aid and maynteinaunce of the world, usurp or take
upon him a transitory dominion and reign of this world: but his heavenly
father will give him the heavenly reign of David: and he shall reign over the
people of Israel for ever without end. Esaias. vii.
Neither shall there ever come any end of his reign, as the Prophet Esaias has
prophesied.

The heart of this virgin did not through these so high promises of the
Angel, weaxe any whit the more haulte to take upon her: neither did she of
the highness of the matters conceive any distrust. She conceived not in her
mind any such presumpcion, that when her son should be a king she on her
party also should be made a queen: neither was she unknowing, that nothing
there was of such high difficulty to be done, which God was not hable with
a mere beck to bring to pass. All her care and thought was only for she
jewel of her virginity, on which she had so much set her love. And therefore
she does not require a token of the Angel, as Zachary had done: Than said
Mary to the Angel. etc.
but does with maidenly shamefastnes, and also according to wisdom no more
but enquire, to know of the Angel the manner how the thing should be wrought
and done: and makes answer unto him in this manner: By what mean or way shall
it come to pass (says she) that I shall bring furthe a son, forasmuch as
I am in such sort espoused to my good man whom I do now live withal, that
yet nevertheless I have no conversation of his body, such as wedlock
requires? For continency lyketh us both, and this point of blysfulnesse, if
it might be, we would full feign have perpetually to endure between us.

And the Aungel answered, and said unto her. etc.
The Angel therefore teaches how it should be done, and takes away from the
virgin all doubtfulnesse concerning her virginity. O virgin (says the
Angel) nothing shall in this matter be done or wrought after the common
course of nature. An heavenly child bearyng shall it be, and by an heavenly
worker shall it from the first end to the last be executed. Thou shall
continue in chaste love toward thy chaste spouse. Fruitefulnesse of issue the
happiest that ever may be, shall come to thy lotte without any detrimente or
violacion of thy virginity. For thou have not an housband given unto threfor
any such purpose, either that he should make thee a mother, or else thou make
him a father: but the providence of God has thought good by this means to
make a sure way for thy safegarde and preseruacion, for thy good name and
fame, for thy virginity and maidenhood, and for thy convenient quietness. It
was gods pleasure that an undoubted witness of this strange chyldebearyng
should be both present and assistente to the thing: he would in no wise, but
that thou should have one, who with chaste and continente living in thy
coumpany, and with all points of feithfull serviceableness, should give
diligent attendaunce as well on thee, as on the child that is to be borne: and
finally, it was his pleasure, that by this devise and pretense, this mystery
should be kept secret from the unbelieving sort, and also kept secret from
the wieked spirits. And this holy copulacion of the divine nature with the
nature of man, shall not violate thy chastity, but shall make it altogether
holy. The father of heaven has determined, after a strange sort, eft sons
to be get his son on thee. Neither shall there any sede of a man mortal
be requisite or needful to this divine concepcion, but the holy ghost shall
from heaven come down into thee: and in thy womb, (as it were in an heavenly
workehouse) shall accomplish the working of this holy babe: and instead of
the bodily or carnal embracing of an houseband, the highest shall ouershadow
thee, in such wise tempering and qualifying his infinite power and virtue to
the measure and capacity of man's nature: that it may be hable to abide the
metyng together and the conioyning thereof. And the power of the highest shall
over shadow thee.
Where filthy lust is in the carnal copulacion of man and wife, there
whatsoever is borne, is borne unclean, and thrall to sin. But this that
shall be borne of thee, (because it shall be conceived of the most holy
embracing of the highest: because it shall be conceived by the workyng of the
holy ghost, who makes all things holy: because it shall be conceived of a
virgin most pure, whom of all women God has purposely heretofore pieked out,
being clear from all spotte of sinfulness) shall immedatly be holy as soon as
it shall be conceived. And at the first, by reason of the human body taken of
the substance of thy body, it shall rightly be called the son of a virgin,
and the son of man: but after the mystery of this birth once perceived and
understood, he shall not be called the son of Joseph, but the son of God:
and that truly, not after the common guyse, as just persons being purged from
sins, and justified by the free favor of God, are by adopcion called the
sons of God: but he shall by a syngular reason and manner, be called the son
of God, of whom he is in very true deed double begotten: once without
beginning or time, and eternal, of his eternal father: and now in time,
mortal, of a mortal mother, and a very natural man of a very woman. And
like as in this ioynyng together, the divine nature shall be united and knitte
with the nature humayne: so shall the child resemble the nature both of the
one parent, which is God, and also of the other, which is man. This mystery
of gods devise and conueyaunce is of an higher sort, then that it may be
perceived even of the very Angels. It is for thee sufficient, to show a
mind beliefull and ready to obey. All the residue shall he accomplish and
bring to effect, who is of power to do whatsoever his will is.

And now to the end that both thy joy may be more aboundaunte, and thine
affiaunce of the more certainty: take a fresh example even very nere at
hand. Behold, thy cousyn Elizabeth, that aged woman, being now a long time
of barainnesse incurable, has (even I my self being the messagier) otherwise
then ever she hoped for, and above the power of nature, conceived a son,
which shall be as a troumpette and an opener of thy child bearyng, her being
conceived with child is now a good while sense of undoubted certainty: her
bealy is up, and the child is quickened and stirs within her. For this same
is the sixth month, sense she has conceived which was commonly called by the
name of barain, even before that she was far strieken in years, yea and now
ferther grown in age, For nothing shall be impossible with God.
then that she might hope to have any issue, although she had not to fore been
barain. This to almighty God has so been thought good, to thentent that all
creatures may understand, nothing to be so vnbelieuable among men, which
the power of God is not able to bring to effect, if it be his pleasure. As
easile shall he give conception to thee a virgin, as he has given to her
being barain, saving that it has pleased him, that thy example should be
singular and pierelesse, because thy child must be alone without piere.
Certain barain women have heretofore by the special gift of God, brought forth
child, but they have brought forth nothing but mere men. Never has any virgin
yet unto this day brought forth child, nor never shall any do after thee,
because that he which being but one person, shall in himself comprehend both
the nature of God and the nature of man, is no more but once to be borne. And
Mary said, behold I am the handmaide^ of y^ Lord.
After that Gabriell had all this said, the maiden made answer in few
words, but words of such sort, as might be a witness of excedyng great
demureness coupled with passing great affiaunce and zele toward God. I know
it (says she) to have been promised by the mouth of Esaias, that a maiden
should conceive and bring forth a son: and I have no doubt, but that God is
hable to do all things that his will is, and that he will not be false in his
promises. That if it has so pleased him, to the executyng of this mystery, to
choose and depute me, being a maiden of the lowest sort and degree of all
others, there is nothing that I can hereby challenge or claim unto my self,
either of merit, or else of grace. It shall every whit come of the goodness of
God: it shall every whit come of the myghtie power of God. I do nothing but
willyngly offer my self as an handemayden to the lord, Be it unto me
according to thy word.
(unto whom I am for altogether dedicated,) ready to be at all his
commandments. I do believe, that thou do promise: and I wyshe that with
all speed it may fortune unto me, as thou do promise. And even with the
word speaking, thatsame heavenly conceyuyng of child, was without any her
felyng or perceiving accomplished: she had in her womb the son of God: she
was replenished of the holy ghost. And anon the Angel leafte her. Of this
holy communicacion of a virgin with an Angel, it was the will of God to
begin all the matter of restoryng mankind, because thatsame first
pestiferous talking of a virgin with the serpent, had brought into the world
the ground and matter of man's confusion and mischief.

Mary being by reason of this gift of God, become the more sad and womanlye,
and also the more ientle and ready to do any thing that she ought to do,
because she had of the Angels words, learned Elizabeth to be with child,
and this now to be the sixte month thereof: she left her own house, and
took her way up into the high country, and with great speed came into the
city of Judah where zachary did enhabite: and entryng into his house, she
offered and gave unto her cousin Elizabeth, words of greting, and how that she
did muthe rejoice and was very glad that Elizabeth was with child. For true
godliness does rather rejoice at the happy fortune of an other body, then
set the mind to make vauntes or bragges of it own. Uirginitie loves
secrecy: it cummeth not forth of the inmoste parts of the house for any
calling, unless duty move it thereunto: and being abroad it makes haste, in
doing any point of duty it takes more laysure. Mary in all her journey
visited ne saluted not one body by the way, And saluted Elizabeth.
until she was come to Elizabeth. Neither was that same a salutacion or
greting of the common sort. All good hap and blissfulness did of this
gretyng either other, encreace unto them both, and the efficacy of the spirit
of God, did in them both the more plenteously abound. Mary carried with her
in her womb the fountain of all ghostely gifts of grace, and through the
inspiracion of the babe in her bealy, she was now altogether in case that
nothing came out of her heart or her mouth, but only of God. Therefore it came
so to pass, that as soon as the salutacion of the virgin Mary had once souned
in the ears of Elizabeth, the babe, which she being an aged woman had than in
her bealy, did leap and spryng, And so it was, that wha^ Elizabeth, heard the
salutacio^ of Marie. etc.
(as ye would say) skyppyng for joy and gladness. John not yet being borne,
felt the divine power of his Lord but even a (...) before conceived: and
within the enclosure and tabernacle of his mothers womb does with gesture
magnify him, whom he should afterward set forth and magnify with his voice.
Neither did Elizabeth without fruit perceive and feel the holy leaping of her
little babe within her. Through her babe enspired from heaven, the mother also
is inspired, And Elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost.
and altogether is full and whole suddenly taken with an happy and blissed
kind of infeccion. Through the voice of Mary, the heavenly power of God
perceth into the babe within the womb of Elizabeth: and through the babe with
this sudden blastyng so taken, the mother too is adblasted, in such sort,
that she on her party also being replenished with the holy ghost, did not
now keep in the joys of her heart: (although she had before kept her self
within doors, and had no talk with her, as one that would not for shame be
acknowen to be conceived with child:) but with a mighty great voice (which
voice her mighty great affeccion and zele did work in her) she cried out, and
uttered such things through the mocion of the spirit, as she neither could
deem of the swellyng of her bealie, ne yet had learned of any mortal manne.
Blissed art thou among women. etc.
And even as though she had heard the Angel talkyng with Mary, thus does she
begin her gratulacion. O happy and blissed maiden (says she) thou shall
have and enjoy the chief praise among all women worthy commendacion. And holy
is the fruit also of thy virginly womb, out of which shall come forth that
same woondrefull flower, who by the voice of all nations, shall be preached
throughout all the whole universal world: of whom long and many a day gone,
the Prophets have prophesied: and he shall have the chief laud and praise
among all things, both that are in heaven, and that are in earth. I
acknowlage it to be a greater thing, and of more excellency, then a mortal
man, that thou bear enclosed within the chamber and tabernacle of thy womb.
If age or years only be esteemed in us twain, it is not unmeet for a young
damisell or maiden to come to an aged woman: but if the dignity or worthynesse
of both our babes that we go withal, be compared: it had been my duty in all
haste to come and visit thee. I truly on my part was happy and fortunate
enough with this benefit of God, that I go with a child, the which shall in
time to come, be a person of no small dignite and estimacion: but of what my
deserte is so great happiness chanced unto me, that she which must be the
mother of my Lord, should thus of her own accord take pains to come to me?
For lo as soon as the voice of thy salutacion souned. etc.
For by an undoubted toke^ have I felt the cumming hither of my Lord. For lo,
immediately when the voice of thy salutacion souned in mine ears, I felt my
young child stiere and leap up in my womb, as one showing an earnest desire,
and gladness to go mete his Lord, and to do unto him his bounden duty of
reverence and homage. And thou too forsouth being a mother, do not unlike
to the child in thy bealie, for he being the Lord and master, does
vouchesafe to come set his servant, of purpose to sanctify him, and to
replenyshe him with the holy ghost: and thou being so far the superior in
dignity, do not think it peinfull to come to me that am thine inferior?
so much the more lowely behauyng thy self, as thou do surmounte and
excelle in heavenly gifts of grace, which gifts, thou do very well, in
that thou do not impute them to thine own merits, forasmuch as they are
things given thee of the free bounceousnesse of God. And bl^ssed art thou that
thou haste believed.
And certes in this behalf art thou much happy, that thou did not
mistrust the promises of the Angel, though they seemed never so much
unlikely to be believed. Thou haste conceived without help of man, and doubt is
there none, but that the residue of things which the Angel has promised
unto thee in the lords name, shall with sembleable truth and suertie be
performed unto thee.

When Elizabeth had by the spirit of prophecy spoken these words, Mary
also, (who through maydenly shamefastenesse had hitherto co^celed the joys of
her heart,) being now suddenly ravished with the holy spirit of God, of whom
she was full and had been a good while erst, could no longer temper herself ne
forbear, but that with an himne of rejoicing and thanks giving, she must
braste out into the land and praise of God, to whose goodness it is to be
attributed, whatsoever high or especial good thing does chance to manne or
woman of this world. O Elizabeth (says she) not without good cause do
thou rejoice in my behalf: but yet this cummeth euerywhit of the gift of God,
yea and of his free gift, and not one jot of it there is, that I can
presumpteously impute to mine own deserts. My soul magnifieth the Lord.
And therefore not my tongue only, but also my soul, acknowledging it own
weakness, does even from the botome of my heart roots, magnify and exalte
the lord with praises: and how much the less of merit it acknowlageth in
it self, so mouche more vehemently does it marvel at the greatness of
Gods benefits. I have cause wherefore to give him thanks, I have cause why
to talk largely of his beneficial goodness, but cause have I none wherefore
to rejoice to my selfe-warde. Yet nevertheless my spirit being enflamed with
the spirit of God, And my spirit has rejoiced in God my savior.
does for joy not possible to be vttred in words, skyp and leap within my
body, not in it self, but in God, who is both to me and to all persons the
only cause and worker of all salvation.

For whereas I was the most abiecte of all women, yet he of his own mere
goodness, has cast a merciful iye on his poor handemayde being of low
degree, and has vouchesaued to give me such a great and high gift, that from
this time foorthwarde according to the words of the and of the Angel, From
he^cefor^: he shall all generacio^s call me blessed.
I shall in folks talk, be called a woman most happy and fortunate, not
only of the Jews that are now at this present day alive, but also in all
years and ages to come, and of all nations of the whole world, to whom a
savior shall happen to be borne of my body. For we may truly be called
happy and blissed in any such thing as is bestowed upon us, not by means of
our own industrye, not for our own merits, but of the free favor of God.
All the laud and praise therefore of this happy fortune, shall redounde to his
land and commendacion, that has freely conferred and given the same. I shall be
reported happy and blissed, but yet happy through his mere bounty and
goodness. because he (...) etc.
And what shall the nations of the whole world in all the process of years
to come talk of me? verayly that he which by his excedyng great power is
hable to do all things, has in me being the meanest of all maidens, wrought
and performed a thing wondrous, and such as never tofore has been heard of.
And therefore shall my name be numbered among the women of good hap: but his
name shall every where be holy, and to be adoured and worshypped: at the
which name every knee of things heavenly, yearthly, and also infernal, shall
humble it self and bough down: and through which name only, salvation shall
come to the universal world. For the profession of this name, shall
perfectlye give salvation and holiness unto all creatures. At the calling on
of this name, shall diseases be driven away, venomes shall leese their
strength, devils shall flee, and dead bodies shall revive again.

And this also shall be a thing of free gift and mere gratuitie, and not of
bette or duty: it shall be of mercy, and not of merit: which he shall
most largely pour forth, not only to the nation of the Jews, which has
looked for his cummyng to themselves and no mo, ne to one age alone, but his
mercy shall sprede abroad every way, and issue from nation to nation, unto the
fertheste ends of the world, and from age to age until the last day of
this world. In deed the Israelites only were once they that looked for this
salvation which was promised by the prophets: but whatsoever person (in what
nation soever it be) has forsaken vices, and begins to have in him the
fear of god, the same shall be reconed in the fellowship and brotherhod of ye
Israelites. This salvation shall extend unto all such, as myslykyng
themselves, shall submit them through feyth unto the lord, whether they be
Greeks, or Fre^chemenne, or Englishemen, or Scithians. And contrary wise, such
persons as puttyng their affraunce and trust in their own deeds shall
proudely set up themselves against the greatness of god: shallbe repelled
and put away from the fellowship and partakyng of this benefit, yea though they
shall be descended even of Abrahames ownselfe, or else of David. For this
benefit of god is not bestowed or given, either for the valuacion of
substance and richesse, or for the estimacion of kynred, or for the works of
the law, or for any other deserts or ablyng of man's power, but by the
commendacion of an humble heart, and an heart that is sorry in it self, that it
is so corrupt, and such an heart, as through sincere and perfect feyth,
depends on gods mere mercy.

For god being in mind and will to cast down the arrogant presumtion of
worldly wisdom and power, has stretched forth the strength and puissaunce
of his arm through his son being now brought in state and form of
humilitee: and the wisdom of this world he has made folyshe, and
vanquished: declaryng himself even when he doothe humble himself most lowly
of all, yet nevertheless to be of more might and puissaunce, then the hygheste
state imperial of all worldly power: and that same which in him seems
folyshe, to be more wise then any wisdom of this world be it never so
wonderful great. Yea and those persons, who bearyng themselves bold on
their own wisdom, and trustyng in their own power have sturdely lyfted up
their necks against god, he has wonderfully disperpled and scattered with
their very own devises and appoyntmentes, according as he had long before
promised by the prophet, saying: I will take and ensnare the wise in their own
wisdom. For while they do with their subtyle wylynesse strive against the
purpose and workyng of God, they have both bewrayed their own foolishenesse,
and also unawares renoumed the sapience of God. And while they do by the
mayntenaunce and supportacion of this world, attempt and labor to oppress the
ordinance of God, they have declared, how much unable this world is, any
thing at all to do against the puissaunce of god, which by their rebellion
they have established and made strong for ever.

So, (the course of things being changed the contrary way,) such persons,
as a foretymes sat like men of high estate in their thrones puffed in pride
of their worldly wisdom, and to be feared as touching the power and
authority of man, he has plucked down out of their high seat: and such as
to the worldward were of low degree, those has the bounteous goodness of God,
exalted up and set alofte. They that appeared to be in the top of the castle
of godliness, are manifestly found to be wicked, and they that seemed to be
such as had nothing to do with God, nor God with them, are now sodainlye
made the children and sons of God.

Such persons as acknowelageyng their own unrighteousness did honger the
justice of God, those has god plenteously filled with his heavenly treasoures
of all goodness: and on the other side, such as in their own conceiptes
thought themselves to be great rich men, and hyghly to abound in good
weorkts, (and therefore did nothing hungre the grace of the gospel:) those
has he cast of from him, houngresterued. For circumcision is turned into
uncircumcision and uncircumcision has succeeded into the glory and honor of
circumcision. The Israelite borne trustyng to himself, is shut a part and
debarred from the kingdom of god: and the gentiles are elected and taken to
the honor of the children of Abraham. The proud Pharisee is refused and cast
of, the harlotes and the lowely publicane is received and taken in. The stif
standers, and the sturdy holders up of their snoute he has cast down: those
that layt as outcastes nothing regarded, and such as were in peril of
miscarrying, those he puttyng forth his merciful hand has reised up and
holden. Such as had their sight, he has made blind: and to such as lamented
their blindness he has opened their iyes. To those that acknowelage their
infirmycye and sickness, His ser^^unte Israel be has taken to him.
he has given health: and such as in their own co^ceiptes seemed to be
perfectly whole, he has even leaft to their disease. Those that vaunted
themselfes to be the children of Abraham, he has plainly declared to be the
children of the deiuill: and such as had no point of kynred with Abraham as
touching the fleashe, those has he through the faith of the gospel, made the
very true children of Abraham in deed. Those that vaunted theimselues by the
glorious name of Israel, those has he reneagued and put away from the
inheritance of the promises made unto Israel: In remembrance of his mercy.
Then as he spoke unto out fathers Abraham etc
but whatsoever person of whatsoever nation, whether being bond or being
free, did willyngly offer himself to the ghostely seruyng of God, him has
God taken unto him, and in every such has he perfectly showed his long
delayed mercy, which mercy he had a fore promised by his word (being uttered
by the mouths of the prophets) to the people of Israel, whom as a people more
derely beloved and fansyed even for his own tooth, he does in the holy
scriptures call his servant. He had never been forgetful of his promysse, but
by reason of the long delay, And to the sede of him.
as though he had forgotten it, despair had creped upon men, but now has he
evidently declared himself to be in no point vnmyndefull of his people. For
this is that same very true succession of Abraham. This is that same true
Israel, whom not the nerenesse of blood does make acceptable to God, but the
sincerity and pureness of feith, by which feith only is God seen. And these
things are not wrought ne dooen by chance or by casualtye, but the thing is
now showed in fact, which long and many years past, God has promised unto our
fathers, Abraham, and his succession. For to Abraham it was said: In thy sede
shall all nations be blessed. And to David it was said: of the fruicte of thy
body will I set upon thy seat. These things, long time before promised, of
good men looked for, and of many an one despatred, it has pleased God now in
these days to perform unto the true posteritye of Abraham, the stock and
kynted of which posterity, For ever.
shall never decay ne fail unto the end of the world.

All these things which were yet to come, Marye did in the spirit of
prophecye, speak forth in plain words, even as though it had been come to
pass and effect already. And than much like about the space of three
months did she make her abode with her cousin Elizabeth, coumfortyng the old
woman both with holy and virtuous communicacion, And returned again to her
own house.
and also withal loving and friendly attendaunce. And even but a little before
the time of her said cousins deliverance, Marie returned home to her own
dwelling place again. For on the one side to help play the midwifes part at
a woman's labor, was no fit nor decent office for a maiden that had never
borne child: and on the other side, she got her away from the great resort
of weomen that were to come shortly after, to be at Elizabethes child bearyng.

And now was the full time come, that Elizabeth should be delivered of
child. And a son in deed borne, did assuredly verify the promises of God.
The matter was by a common brute or noise spread abroad by mean of her
neighbors and kynsfolke, whom, even like as the barainnesse of Elizabeth had
grieved before, so did it now rejoice the same, that of the great mercy of God,
by reason of a manchylde now borne, the name of a mother had happened unto an
old woman of barainnesse desperate, and seemyng to be paste all recouerye, to
whom it had been an happy chance to have brought forth a wenthe, but a much
more luckie hap it was, to have brought forth a son. And even in this
point also appeared the promise of the Angel, And they reioysed with her.
who had said, that it should come to pass, that many an one should be
glad in the birth of that child. For thither came renning many an one, and
declared themselfes to rejoice that she had well sped, and had brought forth
a son. And good reason it was that many should rejoice in the birth of him,
who had been borne to the high benefit of a veraye great maygnie.

him Zacharye after the name of his father. And his mother making answer,
said: not so, but he shall be called John. And they said unto her: there is no
man in thy kynred that is called by that name. And they made signs to his
father how he would have him named. And he called for writing tables: and wrote
saying: John is his name. And they did all meruail. And immediately was his
mouth opened and his toungue also, and he spoke and praised God. And fear came
upon al them that dwelt nyghe unto them. And al these sayings were noysed
abroad throughout all the whole country of Iewrye. And al they that heard the
same, laid them up in their hearts, saying: what mance a child, trow ye
shall this child be? And the hand of the Lord was with him. And now was
come the eight day after Elizabeth's deliverance, in the which day by the
priscripcion, and appoynetemente of the law, the child must be circumcised,
and have his name given him. Her kynsfolkes therefore resorted thither, which
by the order and course of kynred, thought it their parts to see that the
child were duly circumcised as it ought to be. And because the chyldes father
had his speech taken from him, And they called him zachary after the name of
his father,
(who commonly uses at his pleasure to appoynte how the child shall be
named,) the kynsfolkes supposyng and demyng the father to be of the mind and
will, to have that that commonly is wont to be most to men's co^tentacions:
called him zachary after the name of his father. But his mother contrary wise
being taught that thing by the inspiracion of the holy ghost, which of
her house band being than dumme, she could not learn, contended that he
should not be called zacharye, but John: wherein the holy ghost did signify,
that he which was borne should be a publisher of a new law, which new law
should abrogate the tradicions of men of old time, and should turn the carnal
usage thereof, into grace of the spirit. For Zacharias souneth in Hebrew
myndefull of the Lord, and JOHN has his name of grace. The righteousness of
the law did consiste in works prescribed and appointed: and the
righteousness of the gospel consists in grace through feythe. The
kinsfolks did not give place to the authority of the mother, but on the
contrary part contended that he ought rather to be called zachary, And they
said unto her: there is no man in all thy kynred, that is called by that name
because that in all the stock of zachary there was not one that was called
John. And in many child it is a common use, that the remembrance either of
the father or of the graunde father, or of the uncle by the fathers side, or of
some other nere kinsman, be renewed. Yea and yet at this present day, some
such there be, whom the name of zachary does more delight, then the name of
John: tha^ is to wete such persons as cannot yet well abide, that
circumcision, new chaunges of the moon, washynges, holy days, fasles, chose
or difference of meats, and sacrifices, should be abolished, even as it were
men in deed and fact criyng with open mouths: And they made signs to his
father how he would have him named.
The name of John, we will none of it: our old zacharye will we have.
Forasmuch therefore as the woman that lay in childbed, and her kynsfolkes
could not agree, it was requisitie to have the autoritye of the father to end
this contencion. The father had not yet the use of his toungue, although it
was now much necessary for him to say his mind. In such sort therefore as
it might be, he had beckes and signs made unto him to declare by some means
what name it pleased him to have given to his son. Zachary was soon as he
understood the matter, John is his name.
made signs to have writing tables, to thentente he might by dumme letters, in
writing signify unto them the thing, which he had as yet no power with lively
voice to express.

When the tables were brought him he wrote in this wise. John is his name,
signifyng and meaning that same name to had been given unto him by the Angel
before he was conceived. And they did every one of them much woondre, as well
that a strange new found name did like him, as also that the mother which
had her toungue at liberty, And immediately was his mouth opened and his
toungue also.
and the father who could not speak did so agree upon the childs name. And
now did the time draw nere, that the law of Moses should begin to speak,
which hitherto only, by figures and dum paternes, had after a sort poynted
and marked out the grace of the gospel. The time was now come, that belief
should open the mouth of zachary, which the hardness of belief had
according to the promysse of Gabriell, shut up. As soon therefore as he had
written in the tables, by and by also was the tiyng of his toungue looced. And
the first power that he had to speak, And he spoke and praised god.
he did of none other thing begin, but of praisyng Godde, by whose free
bounteousnesse so great an heap of joys had chanced unto him. Onles the
Iewishe tongue keep silence, being both the doctrice and auauncer of carnal
obseruaunces, and also an auoucher of man's righteousness, the evangelical
toungue has no power to speak, which is a preacher, and a setter forth of
grace, of feyth, of charitee, and preaches not the works of the law, which
law does not recover or give unto any man the praise of reighteousnesse by
his own factes, but preaches the ryghteousnes of God by innoce^^ie freely
conferred, and given through ferth. But al these things, first, of an aged
woman bearing a child, of the strangeness of the same chyldes name, of a
soonne borne by the promise of an Angel, of the father of the child first
made suddenly dumme where as he could before speak well enough, and than again
of a dumme man soodaynely made eloquent to the praisyng of God: al thissame was
by a brute and a common rumor spread abroad, not now among their kynsfolkes
and neighbors only, but also throughoute all that same coaste of Iewry,
that is called the hylle country, inso much that not only a great
woondreyng, but also a certain kind of being amassed, and of being in a
tremblyng fear, (which was conceived by reason of so many and so unwont
miracles) did possess the hertes of al folks in those parties. For of these
preaumbles they gathered in their minds, And al they that heard the same
laid them up in their hertes. etc.
that this child which was now borne, was like in process of time to do
great things, and things that had before not been heard of, forasmuch as
his concepcion and birth too, was so soon made notable by woonders and
miracles. They saw his father to be so far stryken in age, that he was very
unlike to have been a geatter of children: and as for his mother, besides that
she was an old woman, they saw her bareinnesse to be such, that every body
thought it paste all hope that ever she should have brought forth any
child: they considered the miracle of zacharias speech, which had been
soodaynly taken from him, and soodainly restored again, they had heard that the
Aungel Gabriel was a worker and a doer in the matter: they well perceived the
insperacion of the holy ghost to be both in the father and in the mother of the
child: they perceived euerywhit of the matter to be above the common rate and
sort of the birthe of other children, and every part thereof to have great
tokens of the virtue and power of God. And these points every body in their
own heart, earnstely considering and weighyng, said secretlye within
themselfes: what man yet one is this child like to be an other day? Not one
of the Prophets was borne after such a wonderful strange sort. For the
veraye miracles of things that have been wrought about his birthe, do
euidentely declare all thissame gear to be dooen by the power of God, which
shall assiste the child being one specallye appointed by god to the executyng
and dooyng of some veraye high things. And the han^e of the Lord was with
him.
Neither did they without good cause thus reason these matters with themselfes.
For the hand of God did in very deed extend and show forth his heavenly
power into the child, and by the child into the parents, myndyng no less
then in due time to show things of greatter woondre,

And to thentente that altogether might both be full of miracles, and also
replenished with all ioyfulnesse, John's father zachary also being altogether
enspyred with the holy ghost, brast out into this hymn souning wholly to the
honor and praise and magnifyng of almighty God.

Openly to be showed and spoken (says he) is the goodness of God, and with all
kinds of praisynges to be magnifyed: who whereas ^e is the God of all
peoples, yet his pleasure was to be of a special purpose called the God of
Israel, not, as though he were not the Lord of al other nations also, but
because it has pleased him that the people of Israel shall be a figure of that
heavenly people, which by renouncyng and despising the yearthlye things of
this world, do labor to atteyne and to come unto that eternal city of
Jerusalem, where God is wurshipped with things invisible. Of al such, what
country soever they live in, and out of what nation soever they be borne, is
God to be praised, who after so long process of time, has at last
vouchsalued in such sort as has not been seen before, to visit his people
being now in great agonye, and almost ^lene tired with the tedyousnes of most
careful and long continued bondage, and being even now at the very point of
utter despair. Against the which people, Satan, sin and the world, had so
mightilye preuailled, that no, manner hope did now remain, neither in the
phariseis, nor in the philosophiers, nor yet in the ceremonies of Moses law.
He has now cast his iye like a merciful lord upon his said people, and
has freelye redeemed them from al these evils.

A mighty tira^ne it was which having a train of an houge coumpaigny of
soldiers to guard him, did ruffle, and play the king over al sorts of men,
out of whose claws it was not possible by any power of man to recover the
deliverance of the Israelites. Only god being of more puissaunce then our
ghostely enemy, gave strength unto the^ yt were weak, sending a capitayn most
victorious, who through ye puissaunce of his godly mightiness, should
overthrow ye power and strength of his adversaries: and by ouercumming death
should freely through feith give unto al persons everlasting salvation. In the
house of his servant David. etc.
And this sure wara^t and fortres of salvation, he has reised up for us in the
house and generacio^ of David, who truly served and wurshipped him, unto ye
which David he had before made sure promise, yt from his sede should this
benefit assuredly come unto all such persons, as after the spirit deserve
to be the children of David, not growyng out of kind, nor sweruing from the
tender love yt their said father David had toward god. David valiauntly and
luckely fought against foreign nations, and against the enemies of the people
of Israel. And se^blablye under this our captain must we fight against enemies
much more pernicious and hurteful, that is to were, against such enemies, as
destruie and ^leagh men's souls, Satan with his army of wieked spirits.
And such enemies be also the corrupt affeccions, and naughty desires of the
mind: prouokyng and busilye stieryng men to such things as are odious and
hateful before god. Such enemies also are those persons (whatsoever they be)
which have more love and desire to the things of this world, then to such
things as are godly: by which persons, as by his instruments and tools,
the devil puts his strength in ure.

Even as he promised by the mouth of his holy prophets, which were sens the
world began, The te^te*
That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate
us. Neither do these things by chance or at al auentures come thus to
pass: but the thing that god does now perform, the same had he many a long
year sens promised by the mouths of all the prophets, whom he had endewed with
his spirit, as many as have prophesied sens the first creacio^ of the world.
For he had made promise, Which were sens the world began. etc.
that by a captain of might and puissau^ce, which should one day be sent, we
should be saved from our enemies, and should be delivered out of the hands of
them all, which did bear us such extreme malice, that they did continually
wrestle and labor to draw us unto death everlasting. And yet was not this
of the merit or deseruyng of us, that are now at these present dates liui^g,
to who^ god has performed this same so high a benefit: nor yet of the
deserving of our fathers, to who^ he had before promised the same thing which he
has now done unto us* But thus has it pleased his gracious goodness,
bounteously to give this so great a thing unto us not deseruyng the same. Thus
has it also seemed good unto his righteousness: at such time as best pleased
himself, to perform the thing that he had promised, to thentent he might
thereby of all creatures be perceived to be not only merciful and
beneficial, but also true and just in keeping his promise. For besides his
earnest promise, he did also make a plain bargain and covenant with our
fathers. For being delited with ^he woondrefull affiaunce and trust of our
chyefe father Abraham toward him, And remember his holy covenant. etc.
(which was so great, that bearyng himself bold upon gods promysse, he
made no manner bones ne stickyng, but went in hand to offer up his only
son Isaac in sacrifyce,) he swore by his own self, to the same Abraham,
saying in this wise: I make an oath, and do swear by my very own self,
because thou have dooen this same thing, and for the respect of me and my
commandment have not spared thine only begotten son, gene. xxii.
I shall bliss thee, and I shall multiplye thy posterity and issue, as the
sterres of the sky, and as the sands that are liyng on the sea shores. Thy
sede shall possess the gates of their enemies, and through the name of thee,
shall all na^ions on the earth be blissed, That we delivered out of ye
hands, of our enemies etc.
because thou have been obedient unto my voice. For in verai deed, this is ye
true posterity and the right sede of Abraham, which is obedient unto God, not
by the ceremonies of the law, but by the obedience of believing in God, who, by
the mean of the gospel, dooethe speak unto the world. And unto such of us
is given the promised victory over our enemies, as being delivered from the
tyranny of sin, delivered from all errors, delivered from the yoke of the
devil, have the grace and hap to renounce our former naughty living, to the
end that from hensfoorth being out of all care and fear, under ye wyng and
safegarde of our captayn, we may now serve no mo masters but him alone, (to
whom only we are bounden debtours for all the goodness that ever we have,)
where in times past we had been bondeseruauntes to ambicion, (which is the
desire of worldelye honor, pomp and glory,) we had been bondeseruauntes to
the carnal lust of concupiscence, to couetise, and unto the deiuill.
Therefore we must now truly serve our said captain, not as our forefathers
did with idle solemnisyng of holy days, In such holiness and righteousness as
are accepted before God.
not with supersticion of honoring the first day of every new moon, not
with absteinyng from one meat more the^ from an other, not with killing of
beasts in sacrifice, which things have nothing but an outward semblau^ce and
show of holiness in the syghte of men: but with pureness of conscience, and
with perfeict clennesse of life, which is the service most acceptable in the
sight of God, who has no regard unto carnal oblacions, but unto the godly
devotion of the heart, as one that louethe to have sacrifyce dooen unto him, of
his own gifts. Neither must this seruyng of God be showed or done, at these or
that days by our own ordeinaunce thereunto prefixed or appointed (as hitherto
customably has been used:) but continually all our life through out. For at
no time should there be any ceassyng or slackyng from dooyng such sacrifice
as this: but love and zele to god ward being ons freelye given us, ought with
holy conversation, and with devout appliyng of our selves from time to time,
to be still more and more increased, Happy therefore by the free goodness of
God, and blessed are we, to whom, according to the sayings of the Prophets,
is now thus given a mighty redemer, and a salueoure, whom no power may
vanquishe or withstand. But by the free goodness of the same God, happy and
blissed art thou also, o my little babe, which art thus specially chosen and
appointed to be the foregoer and messagier of so great a captain. For like as
the day sterre goes before the arisyng of the sun, causing men to awake that
lie sluggyng in sleep, and to look for the clear day light which draws nere:
even so the coming of the lord being now at hand, who has fullye decreed
and intended by his only son to come and visit this present world which
we are in: thou shalt go before him to prepaire men's hertes to the receiuyng
of such a great salvation, lest if the same coming of the Lord should find
the hertes of men slouthfully singgyng, and utterly untoward, ye health that is
now offered, might percase be turned into a manyfolde castyng away and
perishing of the soul. For truly by thy baptisyng, and by thy preaching, thou
shall bring to pass that men shall well perceive themselfes to be sinners, For
remission of sins.
yt they shall know themselfes to have need of a Phisician, and that they
shall know him to be now present here, who alone will through the faith of the
gospel, bounteously give unto al persons, everlasting health and salvation,
freelye remittyng and pardonyng our sins, (which cause the death of the
soul,) and freely conferring and giving his righteousness unto us. And unto all
true beleuers shall this same come, not by any possible merits of me^, but for
thexceading great mercy of ye Lord our God, Through the tender mercy of our
god. etc.
who would not have the^ to perish, who^ he had created. Of the almighty were
we created, and by the most merciful are we restored. We had utterly been
lost unless he according to the goodness that of his propre nature is rooted
in him, had extended his mercy unto us: onles he in manier of the bright sun
arysyng to us from heaven, had on every side driven away the darkness of our
ignorance, unless he had put away the dim miste of sin, and had
enkiendled our cold hertes with the feruente burning fire of his dear love and
charity. We were liyng in darkness, and had no power to lift up our iyes
toward him: he humbled himself down to us, and by sending down his bright
shining beams upon our hertes, he gave clear and healthful light unto us, And
in the shadow of death* etc.
where as we before sat in the derkenesse of sin and in despair of any
recovery, as in the black shadow of death, we were utterly blinded with
manyfold idolatries, and al derkened over and over with worldly desires, we
ran from wickedness to wickedness, groping in most foggie mistines, enbracing
earthly things instead of heavenly, the shadows of things instead of the
things selfs, things carnal instead of ghostely things, pestiferous and
full of poison, instead of wholesome. And lo in the botomelesse night of
despair is now arisen up unto us that same everlasting sun: to direct and
to set the fete of our hertes into the way of the gospel, which is the
way of peace, that through faith and charity makes a perfect agreemente
and unity between god and man: breakyng the strife and enmity that was before
between them: knittyng all nations of the world together in the profession of
one name, and of one faith: and finally in such wise qualifiyng and appeasing
all the troubleous affeccions of the mind, that every man may be at a perfect
staigh of quietness, and of attonemente within himself.

These things did this godly old man pronounce out of his prophetical
breast: and following the exaumple of the old ancient prophets, did in such a
plain sort declare and set forth ye same things before they came, as though
all together had been even at that ^eray present hour already dooen. And
with these so wonderful begynnynges of the matter, the procedinges of the
same did in most best wise agree. For the child John which had been after a
woonderful strange manier borne, like as he grew in body according to the rate
of his years, even so did he through the inspiracion of God, from time to time,
prosper still better and better in stedfastnes, and strength of the spirit.
Neither did he any long time keep himself at home with his father and mother in
their house, And was in wilderness.
but even byanby from his childhood, withdrewe himself away from the common
haunte of people, to the entente that he might not take so much as the least
spotte of fylthinesse that may be, by coumpaigniyng with the multitude,
forasmuch as he had been sanctified in his mothers womb. He never drunk wine
nor any other strong drink, whereby to be distempered: he never tasted of any
worldly pleasure: he never tasted of any worldly honor. All worldly desires
and carnal appetites he passed not upon, but utterly reufsed them, and lived
among the saluage beasts with locustes and wild honey: his wede and clothyng
was of Camelles hydes, and not of silks or veluettes: his gyrdle was of an
hearie thong of leather: his communicacion was continually with God. And
forsouth such a life was comely for him that was ordained to be a preacher of
repentance. Untyll the day came, when he should show himself unto the
Israelites.
And the place which he pieked out, did accordyngly agree with the prophecy,
that calls him the voice of one criyng in wilderness. In this place did he
keep himself out of knowelage by the space of many years, here did he live in
silence, to the end that when his due time should be, he might show himself,
and speak with the more authority. He did not of his own head hastily step
forth to the office of a preacher: but at such time as the spirit of God had
put in his mind to show forth his light, and to open unto the people of
Israel how great a man he was: then did he straight ways begin to do the
part of a foregoer, with no small authority.

The second Chapter.

THus haste thou heard the wonderful birthe of John, which was as a
foregoer to Christ, and as a messagier before his cummyng: now shalt thou
hear the much more wonderful birthe of Jesus Christ himself, who should
afterward be the only Prince of all the whole world, and should move all
nations on the earth to the profession of his name, not by mean of
threatening or putting the^ in fear, but with benefits and with wholesome
doctrine. By the workyng therefore and prou^sion of God it was so conueighed,
that under the Emperor Augustus, (who at that time was Lord of many
countries and realms in all parties of the world, and all things being
every where in perfeic^ peace and tranquillity, held and governed the Empire of
the Romans,) all the provinces and cou^treyes, as many as held of the Empire
of Rome, should be surueighed and nou^bred by the polles, to thentente they
might acknowleage Augustus for their Lord and king, and that (as we call it here
in England) they might be sworn to be true liegt people to themperoure
Augustus, there went out a commandment from Augustus the Emperor
and to his successors Emperors of Rome. Which thing god wroughte even of
purpose, that it might appear how much wyder in circuit and larger the
dominion of Christ did reach, then the dominion of Ceasar: and how much more
quiet and ientle Christ's manier of reignyng over men is, (who takes nothing
away from us, and yet geuethe us heavenly things too) then ye reignyng of
Ceasar, who although it lie not in his power to give heavenly things, yet
nevertheless catches away our worldly commodities, and by extort power
enforces men to take him for their king, whereas the heavenly Emperor
Christ, does ientilly allure men unto him by his beneficial goodness toward
them. That they are regystred or booked among the subjects of Ceasar, what
other thing do they, but acknowlage a verai state of servitude and bondage,
and daily find their worldly substance pared away and diminished? But they
that registre themselves as servants to this new prince, do receive perfect
freedom, with a sure waraunte of everlasting salvation. And, few words to
make, the Emperor Octauius Augustus, although he was among all the Emperors
of Rome, a man of most good policy and conueighaunce in passing all his
affairs, yet many nations there were, which he could not subdue for all his
great armies, and for all his valiant men of war: where as our captain
Christ has without any force of arms, and without any garrisons of
worldly puissaunce, gathered together into one church, as into one kingdom,
all the whole universal world, so many sundry languages, so many sundry
rites, so many sundry sects of seruyng this god and that god, of men's own
deuisyng, and so many barbarous nations living in sundry privy corners. But
now (to go forth in our matter,) for the executyng of this general surueighe
and tax that should be taken in the country of Syria, there was sent as well
by thautoritie of Ceasar Augustus, And this taryng was the first and executed
when Quirinus was Lieutenaunte in Syria, etc:
as also by a decree of ye whole Senate of Rome, one Quirinus, the rewler and
lieutenau^te of that province. And this was even the very first tax that ever
this rewler took in Syria, for diverse and sundry others were taken afterward
in the same province within the time of the same man's being lieutenaunt there.
At the commandment tha^ of Ceasar, which this Quirinus had caused to be
every where proclaimed, all persons take their journey, and go every one to
their own tribe and kynred that they came of, and to the city that proprelye
belonged to the same tribe. And thither resorted they every one to acknowlage
Augustus the Emperor of Rome, for their Lord and head governor on earth, as
the custom was to do. And so it was that Joseph the spouse of the virgin
Marye, Because he was of the house and ^^nage of David. etc.
whereas he was of the tribe of Judah, and his wife Marye of the same trybe also,
yet nevertheless dwelled in Nazareth: which was a poor little city in
Galile. Joseph therefore shuttyng up his doors and leauyng his house, resorted
toward his own tribe, that is to wete, into Iewrye, toward a little preaty
city called Bethleem, of king David's buildyng, because y^ both Joseph and
also the virgin Marye, did not only belong to the tribe of Judah, but also were
by liniall descente come of the progeny and stock of David, of whose seed it
was promised that Christ should be. But of al these things was there no one
point that chanced by mere casualtye, but every whit of it was procured and
purposely dooen by the providence and determynacion of god, to thentente that
the end and conclusion of altogether should in every behalf agree with the
holy sayings of the Prophets, which divided the glory of so great, and so
high a matter between two cities, that is to were, the king of the world to be
conceived and bred up in Nazareth, and the same king to be borne in Bethleem
according to the prophecy. To the same place than did the virgyn Marye also
being great with child, and now even very nere her time, accompaignie her
spoused houseband Joseph. This virgyn though she had a great bealye, yet
refused not to trauaill such a great journey with her houseband: she forbore
not to be or to come in ye sight of men knowing herself in her own conscience
to be clear from all spotte of sin: she thought not scorn to be obedient
and serviceable to her houseband, though ye time was at hand, when she should
be a mother, and bring forth God: she disdayned not to be taken and used as
the wife of a poor Carpenter, though she were a woman full and whole
consecrated to God.

And so, while they by occasion hereof made their abode there for certain
days, and remained in the city of Bethleem: it fortuned that the full months
of her goiyng with child expired, and the time of her deliverance was now
come, which thing God wrought to thentent it might the more evidently be
known and seen to all persons, that he which was then borne there, was
naturally veraye man in deed. The Lord of heaven and yerth pieked out for
himself to be borne in a slender and basse little town, in which
nevertheless he had no house at all: he chose out parents of the pooreste and
loweste sort. It was also his pleasure to be borne in a strange place from
his own home, to the entente that we should be ashamed both of our pride, and
also of our avarice, and that we might at least wise by his exaumple learn,
that man's felicity is not to be measured or esteemed by these common gooddes
of this transitorye world, which if they be not taken away from us, yet we
first or last are taken away from them: but the bliss of man to be esteemed
by such good things and treasures, as endure for ever: yea and that it might
ferther be a lesson for us to gather and lay up treasures to that same
countreyward, to the end that we may there continuallye without end, have
the fruicion of them. For if we will vpryghtely make comparison of the matter
with true judgments, there was more dignity and high estate, more power, and
more majesty, in this same most humble and poor birth of Christ, then in all
the pompes, triumphs, and solemn shows of royalty, of all the Emperors
that ever were. Thus than in Bethleem (which is called the house of bread) did
this holy yo^g virgin bring forth unto us, And she brought forth her first
begotten son.
that same heavenly bread, of which whosoever eats, does never dye. And this
was that same only child bearyng of a virgin, the like president or ensau^ple
whereof, was never before, nor never after followed. And the child was to his
mother her only son, and in respect to us her first begotten, in respect of
us (I say) whom he has in spirit joined to himself, and made us both his
brethren and also partakers with him of his everlasting inheritance, because
he would not come alone to his father, but he, as the first begotten son on
his own party, would bring with him many mo brethren besides himself to the
fellowship and partakynge of everlasting salvation. Now when this little babe was
borne, the mother did not put it forth to the nourcing of other women, (for on
the one side, for tender motherly love that she bare to it, she would none
other nources but herself, and on the other side, And laid him in a maungier
because there was no room for them in the inn.
by reason of her pouertye she had none,) but her very own self with her own
hands, lapped it up in swaddling ba^des and cloutes such as she had. And
because that in the common ynne, where hostery and lodgyng was kept, there was
by reason of the great resort of welthier geastes, none other room ne place
void for her, being but new delivered of child, she laid down her young babe
in a maunger that was there by, instead of a cradle. Give ear thou proud
rich man what ever thou be, that heapeste together possessions and lands upon
lands: and that art in every corner a builder of houses, offer me holds, of
mainours, and of palacies. He that is both the Lord and also the maker of
heaven and earth, and to whom thou thy self haste in baptism professed and
acknowlaged thy self a disciple and servant, is borne in a straung place from
his own home, and has not ne can geat so much as a little corner of good
room in a common hosterie. If thou acknowleage thy sovereign Lord and
master, whose commandments thou have by a faithful oath bound thy self to
obey and fulfill: leate it not g^eue the to follow his exaumple, but rather be
thou ashamed of thine own proud mind.

Her ken now in what sort this humble poorenes of birthe is altogether full
of all princely royaltye. There was a tour not far from Bethleem, called in
the Hebrew toungue the toure of Ader, (as if ye should say in English, the
toure of the flock) and it was so named, because that by reason of the good
pasture grou^des that lay inthose parties, there was very great store of
sheep and other cattall pastured there. And in deed of this toure Ader does
the Prophet Micheas also make mencyon, like as he does of Bethleem. There
were therefore in those quarters diverse shepeherdes that watched abroad in ye
night seasons for safegarde of their flocks. Ueryly even by the thing self
geuyng a good lesson, what thing bishops ought of their bounden duetye to do
for the health of the people committed to their spirytuall charge, if they will
follow ye ensaumple or steps of Christ the Prince and head of all shepeherdes.
And in the night time was thatsame most bright sun of righteousness borne,
which should on every side, put away the darkness of the world. And his
pleasure was first of al to have his birth known, rather to men of low degree,
because he was borne after a poor soort, and to shepeherdes, because himself
was a ghostly pastoure, then to Emperors, to kings, to rulers or deputies of
cou^treyes, to Phariseis, to Scribes, to bishops. And lo, suddenly the Aungel
Gabriel stood on high derectely over their heads, and besides him also a
certain straung light suddenly flushed and shone round about the shepeherdes,
which was neither the light of the sun, nor of the moon, ne of any candle.
But although thissame were a thing that seemed no less then to betoken some
good luckye thing to be toward, yet the shepeherdes, by reason of the vnwonte
and soodain miracle, were all at ons thoroughly taken with a very great fear.
But the Aungel anon takes away this fear with speaking amiablie unto them.
For unto you is borne this day in the city of David a saueour which is Christ
the Lord.
Do away all fear (says he) there is no cause why ye should dread. For I
am come to be unto you a messagier of a most gladdesome matter, and such joy
as never yet has been heard of, do I bring, not to you only, but also to all the people of Israel. The godly mouths of the Prophets long and many years
gone had promised you a salueour. Many a long year has Messiah been looked for.
And this night is thatsame Messiah borne, and borne he is unto you all. And
this is the veraye true Messiah, the Prince and Lord of all, a king and a
priest anointed of God from above. And in deed borne he is in the city of
David called Bethleem, according to the holy sayings of the Prophets, eu^^
thissame very night. Go ye, and enquire of him. I will give you a to^^^
whereby he may be known. Go ye to the common inn, and there shall ye find the
little suckyng babe lapped in swathyng cloutes, and laid down to rest in a
maungier. As Soon as Gabriell had thus much said, immediately was heard a great
multitude of heavenly soldiers, Praysyng God, etc.
that is to say, of Angels, who are the minysters and servants of the Lord
being mighty and puissaunt in battaill, and the which also do war and fight
for us against the Princes of this world. These Angels with such an heavenly
armonie and with such a melodious sweet noise as no tongue can express, did
sing songs of praise unto God, magnifiyng and setting furthe his unspeakable
love toward mankind, and declaring the great joy and gladness that they had
conceived on the behalf of the same mankind, to whom so great blisfulnes had
through Gods mere favor and mercy so happened. And the hymn forsouth which
that same heavenly quier of Aungelles with such sweet tunes sing all together
in one charm, was this: Glory on high to god, on earth peace, and in men
good vville. Which song of the Angels does much in effect signifye unto us
verailye that in this matter no point at al of glory is due neither to the
Aungelles ne yet to man, Glory to god on high
but all the whole glory and laud thereof is due unto the only goodness of God,
who of his mercy and love toward us whom he has created, does by
wondrefull ways and conueighaunce provide for us from heaven, to the intent
that we should well perceive, that whatsoever thing either for our honor and
anauncement, or else for our health and salvation does happylye chance unto us
it cummeth upon us from heaven: and that we ought here on yearthe to wish or
desire none other thing but peace, which may abolyshe sin, And peace on ye
earth and to men good will.
and bring us into the favor of God, and the which may knit us together with
mutual love and charity of one toward another. For thissame is truly the
peace, (not of the world, but of God) which does excede and pass all the
compace and r^ache of ma^s understanding, and far out weighs all points
and degrees of any blisfull state that may be in this present world. And this
peace is freely offered unto us through this reconciler and maker of atonemente
between God and man, not by any mean or help of our own merits and
deserts, but of the ready and willing goodness of God toward us, whom it
has pleased after this woondrefull manner, to provide for the recouerye and
saving of mankind.

The shepeherdes said one to another.
The Angels as soon as they had with their most joyful and gladsome noise
begone unto the shepeherdes with synging this song in honor of the childs
birth, returned again into heaven. This done, the shepeherdes being a sort of
good homely plain folks, came and laid their heads together in counsel, not
doubtyng of the words that the Angels had spoken, but coveting more fully to
know the thing that they had heard. Thus therefore spoke they among themselves,
and said one to another: Leat us do as the Aungel has advertised us, leat
us go hence even straight to Bethleem, that the thing which we have with our
ears heard to be happened, Let us go now eue^ unto Bethlem and see thy^ thing
etc:
we may even there presentely see and behold with our iyes, to the intent,
that we may with the more ready and perfect truth and credit, speak and
declare unto others, the thing that the Lord has vouchesalued to give us
knowelage of, by his Angels. This godly devise lyked them all.

And so forth on their way go the shepherdes with all haste: devotion, and
godly zeal was a spur to their hearts to prick them foreward: anon were
they come to Bethleem, and come they were into the ynne appointed. And there
(even as the Angel had promised) they find Marie newly delivered of child,
and Joseph a witness of the virgins deliverance, and the babe also bound up in
swathyng clothes, and laid thereby in a maungier. These devout and godly
shepeherdes are nothing at all offended, neither with the bare poverty of the
tender young virgin, And when they had seen it, etc.
nor with her housband being to the sight and estimacio^ of the world a man of
the meanest and bassest sort, ne yet with the poor, little babe, whom for
defaulte of a more commodious place, the parents were feign to lay down in a
maungier, (which things would have made ye proud Phariseis and Scribes to take
utter scorn and disdain at the matter,) but ye shepeherdes are by all these
things the better confirmed to believe the matter more steadfastly, when they by
witness of their own iyes perfeictly knew and found that it were no fables ne
lies that the Aungel had told them tidings of. And here may we note, that
tender love and zele toward God, has in all persons (be they never so
slender or low of degree) a certain wisdom and worldly cast of it own in
things. For these shepeherdes did not even byanby publish abroad the thing
that they had heard: but as soon as they perfectely knew the thing to be
certain and out of doubt: than did they not fear to talk the thing that they
had heard, abrod also among other coumpanies. Christ loved to have the talk of
his birthe, and cummyng, first to arise and begin of such reporters, and
publishers, as were men of such simplicity and plainnes, that no man would
suspect or mystrust any of them either of fablyng and lying, or else of clokyng
and counterfeycting. They had no such wit as to invent a lie of their own
brains, they could no skylle to devise or to put any thing more the^ truth to
that that they had seen, but the thing that they had heard and seen, even as
they had heard and seen it even so and none otherwise did they show tidinges
of it unto me^ of good hearts and disposicions. And among no small number of
men, did the words of the shepeherdes find credence, inso much that it made
a great maynie veraye desirouse and feign to have a sight of the child. And al
they that heard it. etc,
And here in this behalf mark thou and consider the wise sobernes and
demurenes of the holy tender virgin Mary. She learneth of the shepeherdes what
news the Angels told them, and what song the quier of the heavenly soldiers
did sing, and she alone on her own party, holds her peace, keeping close in
her breast, and with diligente consideracion weighing and conferring in her own
heart, But Marie kept al those sayings. etc.
all these things that had fortuned as well now at this present, as also before
when the Angel appeared unto her self. She keeps secret (until the due time
should come to open it,) all the misterye of her being conceived with child,
she was yet a pure virgin, she makes no vauntes ne bragges in coumpanye among
other folks, of her happy fortune. She had before unto the Angel Gabriel,
promised herself a ready handemayden for God to work his will upon, and even
like an humble handmayden she uses herself. She makes no words at all, but
depelye considers in her mind, the strange course of Gods weorkyng and
drift in this matter. She considers all things to be full of strange
miracles, she sees in every part of it two extreme contraries myngled
together, that is to wete, on the worlds behalf exceadyng lownes, poverty,
and abieccion, and on Gods behalf inestimable highness and majesty. For a
young babe is conceived in the womb, but an Angel was the messagier that so
it should be, and the holy ghost the worker of it: A child is borne, but the
mother of it, is a maid: it is laid in a mau^gier, but the Angels being
full of all godly reioysyng do sing from heaven in honor of it. It lies
unknown in a blind corner of no regard, but all heaven bougheth down to
wurshyp the majesty of it, as soon as it is borne. Now these things thus
being done, the sheperdes return back again to their flocks, glorifyng and
praysyng God as concerning all the things that they had heard of the Angels,
and for that they had truly found every thing even as they had heard before of
the same Angels.

But as soon as the eight day after her deliverance was come, at the which
eight day, the law of Moses commands every man child to be circumcised,
that is to say, to have the foreskynne of his flesh pared away round about (for
this thing form Abraham furthwarde it pleased God, that it should be ye sign
and the mark of all such as should be reputed or taken to be of his sede
and generation) the law was satisfied in this point also, Gene. xvi.v
in consideracion that he was not come to break or to fordooe the law, but to
fulfill it. Neither did he disdeigne to take the accustomed remedy appointed
by the law even as though he had been subject to sin as his parents were,
whereas he alone and none but he was fre and clear from all corrupcion of sin,
and he alone that should take away all the sins of the world, and should
chose unto him a new people, which should have an heart well cleansed from
all the desires of the flesh: and that not with knives of blounte stone, but
with the sharp sweorde of the word euangelical, which purgethe and cleanses
all things through faith. Yea, and a name was given him too, as the custom
and ye manier was to do to others. For he was called in Hebrew Jesus, which
souneth in English, savior. And this name was not by a casual thau^ce at al
auentures, His name was called Jesus. etc.
orels by man's will given unto this child, but by the authority and
commandment of God it had been appoincted and given him before of the Aungel
Gabriell, ere he was conceived in the virgins womb: which was done to the
end that men might even at the first, by the veraye word of his name, be
advertised and done to wete* that thissame was very he which should thoroughly
give unto all persons true health and salvation, Math, i,
and should in such wise represent the true guide and captain Iosue, that
when his people were clean pourged from al filthiness of vice and sin, he
should conueyghe and bring them into the land of heaven, flowyng most
plentiouslye with joys everlasting, And when the time of their purificacion
(after the law of Moses) was come, they brought him to Jerusalem, to
present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord: Every
manchilde that first opens the matrice, shall be called holy to the Lord)
and for to offer (as it is said in the law of the Lord) a pair of turtle
doves. or.ii. young pigions.

Hitherto (that is to say until the circumcision of Jesus, the eight day
after his birthe,) all that was done, was nothing but as it were making of
signs and profers unto the gospel under certain fygures, the which gospel
was of necessytie to be preached first unto the people of the Jews. On the
fifth day after the circu^cisyon, there came three Magians (that is to say,
Philosophiers of high learning in the priuyties of Astronomy, and the other
scyences mathematical) and these Magians had by the showing and poyncting of a
certain new sterre, been half enforced to come from a far place out of the
East countries, purposely to see this child. They kneled down and wurshipped
the new borne sovereign of the world, and honored the same with mystical
presents or gifts, signifying by a certain show and semblaunce of things,
(such as might be made,) that the Gentiles should in time to come, embrace
the grace of the gospel, when the Jews being manquillers and murderers of
Jesus, And when the time of their purificacion. etc
had wilfully cast of and forsaken the same. Again when the.xl. day from
Mary's deliverance was come, at which.xl. day, the law of Moses wills and
bids any manchylde, being the first borne child of a woman, to be
presented unto the Lord, and ferther appoynteth a gift or a present to be
offered for the purifying as well of the child new borne, as of the woman that
lay in (because the common childbearing and deliverance that women have, is
not without much vnclenesse of the body) this tender young virgyn being one
of most syngular demurenes and myldenesse, refuses not in this behalf,
neither to seem like unto other women, which after the common course of nature
do bring forth children, ne auoydeth to do as they do: whereas in this her
chyldebearyng there was nothing at al defiled with any spot of uncleanness, but
every part of it replenyshed with heavenly purity and with holiness. For
what poyncte of vnpurenesse could such a woman have in bearyng child, as
without so much as once touching of any man had conceived by the only power
and virtue of god embracing her through the working of the holy ghost? And as
touching the child, I pray you, was it possible for any spotte of fylthynesse
to be in such a child, as being borne from heaven, was come into this world
even for this only purpose, that he alone and only might pourge all mankind
from all filthynes of sin? But partly it was the will and pleasure of God,
by such notable exaumples of sobrenes and humility as these be, to break
the pride of man: and partly it was conuenyente that he which was come to
pergette and close up both the broken walls, that is to say, was come to
join and knytte the people of the Jews and the people of the Gentiles both
together into one professyon of the gospel, should in all behalfes and in
all poynctes satysfie the law of Moses, They brought him to Jerusalem, to
present him to ye Lord.
from which the first faith and authority should afterward proceed and come
unto the gospel.

The mother therefore and Joseph, (who by the determinate and advised working of
God was yet still thought and supposed of every manne to be the father of
Jesus,) brought their young babe unto Jerusalem, to the end he might in the
temple there be presented in the sight of the Lord, to whom he was dedycated
and hallowed: not as though God were not Lord and true owner of all things,
but by a mystycall figure to teach us, that such hertes and none others, be
throughlye accepted before God, as after the subduing and vanquyshyng of all the
inordynate desires of the fleashe, (in which reigns naught but the
corrupcyon of nyce tendrenesse) do with mannelye strength of the spirit,
Exodus xiii. a, and. xxii. d.
stoutely set forth toward those things which are heavenly and
everlasting. The law of Moses meaning this same thing, had prescribed and
appointed, that every male kind, as soon as it had once opened the matrice of
the dame, and were come into the world, should be reputed and taken for hallowed
and consecrated to the Lord, Nume. viii. b.
whether it were brought forth by a woman or by any brute beasts, to the
entente that even of these also the first fruits should be allotted unto the
priests, and yet under such condycyon, that the first borne of mankind
might be redeemed with a small offreyng and boughte out of the priests
hands, except it were a child of the trybe of Leui. Leuit. xii. a.
But the law self does openly discharge and deliver this holy childe^ wife
from the band of the law, when it says in the third book of Moses
entiteled Leuiticus: If a Woman have conceived, and borne a manchilde, etc.

Exodus xiii,.a.
For this mother was neither properly to be called a woman forasmuch as she
knew no part of any man's body, nor had brought forth child by receiving
seed from any other party. And again when it says: Every one of the male
kind that first opens the matrice. etc. It does sufficientely declare it
self to mean of the common mannier of delyueraunce that mothers have of their
children, which mothers, by reason that the seal of their virgynytie is
broken up before by the manne, do bring forth child neither without much
vnclenesse, nor yet without a certain kind of being put to shame. And as for
this heavenly child, neither when it entered, nor when it came furthe, did by
any means pollute the enclosure and tabernacle of the maydenlye woumbe of his
mother, but rather did consecrate the same and seal it up that from hencefurthe
neither her body being a temple once for ever dedycated unto God, ne yet her
soul being (as ye would say) a closet for the holy ghost, replenished with
all odoryferous sweet savors, might be open to receive any stayning or
corrupcion of wordely fylthinesse. He therefore which was the Lord of all
things that are both in heaven and in yearthe, was presented and offered in
the temple, as one subject and bound unto the law. And he was agreed for and
redeemed out of the priests hands again for a small price, which should
afterward redeem all the whole universal world with the price of his blood.
For the law had prescrybed, that the parents might bye out the first borne
manchilde with a lamb of one year old, which was given to be a burnte
offering: and than besides the lamb there should be brought a male Pygyon
or a turtle dove for the pourgyng and dooyng away of sin if any spotte
thereof had been gotten, either in the carnal copulacion at the begetting of
the child or else afterward. For it ought on every side to be pure,
whatsoever thing is to be offered unto the lord. That if the penury and
lack of substance on the parents behalf, could not well suffer a lamb to
be given, than instead of the lamb there was given a turtle dove, or a young
pigion for the redeming and bying out of the child, and the other bird was
offered for the pourgeyng of sin. They offered therefore the gift of poor
folks. And there is no doubt but that they would have given a more
bountiful offreyng, had not their poverty been a let thereof. They had
hertes rich with good love and zeal toward godde, but for an ensaumple to be
prepared for us to follow, their profession and open knowlagyng of their
poverty was more expedyente and served better. And all these things were by
the dispensacion of gods ordinance thus executed and done, partly for many
other causes and consideracions, and most specially for this cause and purpose,
that the veraye truethe of our humayne nature might by so many euydente
proufes and tokens, be declared to be in the child. Marie was s^ene with her
great bellye in the ynne: within a little space, as soon as she had brought
furthe child, her great bealy was gone again: the child being but even newborn, was known and found out by the shepheardes: he was sought out and
wurshypped of the Magians: he was circumcysed after the solemn custom used in
that nation, and eftesons brought he was into the temple, and there openly
presented unto the pryestes: by these things it came to pass, that neither
any body might doubt of his birth, and yet he by little and little came to the
notice and knowlage of mo and mo, but most chiefly of mean folks, yea and of
none but godly and devout persons only. For meet it was, that such a thing
should neither with a few proufes be enforced, nor yet with only common
poynctes of euydence be confirmed, the which being credited and believed,
should unto al ages and times as well past as to come, and to all persons,
bring everlasting health and salvation, and being not believed should contrary
wise bring everlasting death. An Angel therefore cummeth in message from God,
and brings word of the thing before unto Marie: her spouse Joseph is joined
unto her before, to the end he may be a true witness of the mattier:
Elizabeth which had lived barayne till she was an aged woman, brings forth
child: zachary, when he had a long time continued dumme, is restored to the
use of his tongue, and has his speech again: both of them as well zachary
as Elizabeth are sodaynelye rauyshed with the spirit of prophecy: John
leapeth in his mothers woumbe for joy: a virgin without man's help
conceyueth child: Magians being straungiers of a far country, come renning
to have a sight of the child, and do wurship him on their knees: Shepheardes
talk of him abroad, and declare openly that he is come. By such a great
noumber of euidente tokens, and by so many strange wonders and miracles is the
new birth of this child approved and aucthorised.

Now to the entente that there should be no sex, no age, no state or degree
of men, nor no profession, but that Christ should have testimony and
witness of every one of them, neither any one body left behind, but that
he might assuredly promise unto himself health and salvation at the hands of
the same Christ: And the same man was just and godly. etc.
there was at the same time in Jerusalem a certain man named Symeon, a man
by reason of old age cold in his body, but in spirit feruente hot: of
body feeble and impotente, but of soul quiver and lusty: of years dry and
withered, but in all perfectenesse of good living as fresh as flowers: that is
to wete a veraye just and vpryghte man, and in very deed a devout manne, and
full of Godliness, not huntyng about for glory and lucre at the hands of
men after the exaumple of the Phariseis, but right desirouse and much
hungryng for the health and salvation of al mankind in general: whom no
delight or pleasure did make willing to continue in this life, saving only that
he might with his own iyes once see the veraye self Messiah, whom the wholly
sayings of the Prophets had promised to come for the veraye entente and
purpose, to recomforte the people of Israel, which people had been long
time before many ways in much distress, and did even veraye than live in
grievous afflyccyon. And ye holy ghost was in him. etc.
This Symeon (as in deed a good manne he was) had assured knowleage before by
inspiracyon of the holy ghost, that the same day and time was now already
come. And whereas he had with most ardente prayers besoughte the lord to give
him the gift, that he might but even once with his bodily iyes behold the
Messiah now so many hundred years looked for: he had in the secret closet of
his godly breast, received an answer of the holy ghost, that he should be
sure not to depart out of this present life, but that he should first see
with his bodily iyes that same blessed babe, whom he had seen many a day
before with the iyes of his ^eyth, to the end he might witness him to be
come in deed, whom he did nothing doubt but that come he should: that same
blessed child (I say,) whom for a very south god has singularely above al
other men enoynted that he might have and enjoy both a kingdom for ever
to endure, and also a priestehood never to be abrogated or abolished. And he
came by inspiracio^ into the temple.
Therefore when the time should come that the child Jesus should be
brought into the temple (as we have said,) the blyssed old manne before
named, being secretly warned by the mocyon of the spirit, came even a little
before into the temple. And when Marie the mother of the child, and Joseph,
who was yet still believed to be his father, brought the babe into the temple,
there to execute and to do such things as unto the accustomed rites of
purifycacion did appertain: Than took be him up in his arms and said.
as soon as the child was offered up, and the pryeste had received it as the
manner was, and had blessed it: the godly zeal of the old man could no
longer forbear, but that he also would needs take in his arms, the little
young babe, whom he had so greatly longed for, and even furthwithall, his
voice (being in case not long after to continue, but to fail by reason of age)
suddenly brast out into the praising of God, singing out a most sweet and
melodious song much after the sort (if ye will so lyken it) as in the poets
and Philosophiers it is written, Lord, now lea^^este thou thy servant
depart in peace.
that the swannes use to do a little before they shall dye: and thus he said:
All my desires, o Lord, are now fully satisfied. Now will I be willing and
glad to dye: For now thou geuest thy servant leave to depart with a
restfull and a quiet mind, not felyng ne having any ferther want at al or
lack in this life, but even desirouse and fayn now to pass out of this feeble
old carkas, unto the blissed company and fellowship of the godly persons,
which have long before now looked for this day, For mine iyes have seen thy
salvation. etc.
and yet never had the hap to see it, but with the spirytuall iyes of their
faith. My prayers are now more aboundauntlye satysfyed, who have had the
hap even with my bodily iyes also to see, and to whom it has been given in
mine old arms to embrace, thine only son, by whom, and through whom, it
has pleased thee to give true health and salvation, not only to the people
of Israel, but also to all nations of the universal world. In this babes
little body (though it be but homelye and symply borne to the syghte of the
world) I acknowlage, o lord, thy virtue and power. I acknowlage this babe to
be the light of the world promised by the holy sa^ynges of the prophets. A
light to lighten the Gentiles. etc.
I acknowlage this child to be the brighte son, which it was thy holy will
and pleasure to have spring up and arise unto the world, that it might on
every side drive clean away the darkness of all the Gentyles, and that thy
people Israel might have whereof, not without good cause, to glory: thy
people Israel (I say) being in true deed thy veraye own, not after the
flesh only, (wherehence in deed the beginning of this salvation has
proceeded:) but after a spiritual kynred, which is acquired and purchased
through the faith of the gospel. For such an one veraylye is to be called
by the name of Israel, whosoever earnestly fixes devout and godly iyes upon
this same light, and with the violence of faith, forceablye breaks into the
kingdom of heaven. In times paste hitherto, the people of the Jews has
gloryed and made all their vaunte upon Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: they have
gloryed and made great vauntes of Moses, of their temple, and of the prophets:
but now from hensforth the gostly Israel, (which is here and there in sundry
places dispersed throughout all the world,) shall glory on thy son, whom
thou have vouchsalued to send after all the others here mencyoned, as one that
in greatness, in virtue, and in power, is far above them all. Now at this
present in deed he lies hidden in a corner, not known as he ought to be,
but of veraye few persons: but in time to come the light of him shall blase
abroad, and he shall with his bryghte shynyng beams, lyghten all quarters and
coasts of the world.

Now the mother of the infaunte, and Joseph, seeing all this to be spoken of
the old manne Simeon, by the inspiracion of the spirit of god, conferring it
also with the other things that had gone before, said never a word but,
merueyled in their minds what the old man's words might mean. But Symeon,
when he had blissed the child, and also had prayed god to send the parents
much joy of him, turnyng himself unto Marie, said unto her. This son of
thine, although he has been given us of god, to the end that he may give unto
all persons everlasting salvation: yet through the defaulte of man it shall so
chance, that like as he shall lift up to the hope of everlasting health a
great maignye, which shall willingly enbrace the gift of God: even so a
great number of the people of Israel, utterly despysing the bounteouse
goodness of god cummyng toward them, and offreyng itself unto them, shall
be cast down to eternal damnacion. For when the truth shall by this thy
son be opened and published, many shall fall which before seemed to stand,
And for a sign which is spoken against. etc.
and many shall arise up, that seemed to lie in the duste. He has been looked
for of all the Israelites: but he shall not be received of them all. For he
shall be set up unto all for a sign, such an one as never has yet been set
up sense the beginning of ye world: but yet shall he be one that shall have many
a man to speak against him and deny him. The Phariseis, ye Scribes, and the
bishops shall make much murmuring and prating against him: the unbelievers and
heritiques shall make much clamouring and roryng against him. And so much
sediciouse brablyng shall from every place be raised against him: that even
thou thy self shalt not be without some part of the euilles that shall
come. That the thoughts of many hertes may be opened. etc.
For the cruelty of them shall not light upon such persons only, as shall
believe on thy son: but also thy very own heart and soul, shall the
sweorde of doloure and gryefe perce. Such a sign has it pleased God to show
forth before the iyes of al men, that the clear light of the truth being
once showed forth to shine abroad, the thoughts of men might and should be
discovered, which before lay hidden in their hearts: and that the course of
things should in such wise be turned the contrary way, as the thing self
might playnelye declare, that they were far of from the true righteousness,
which in the sight and judgment of men, seemed to sit even in the high chair
of righteousness: and such to be manifestelye found wieked, as had gotten
and taken into their own hands, the doctrine and teaching of true relygyon
toward god: and contrary wise such as before were reputed for men far out
of the way of true religion and godliness, might be plainly declared to have
been much more nere unto true relygyon, then the others: and such as seemed
unto the world to be rejected and paste all grace or hope of recovery, such
should the unfeigned readynesse of believing in god, admit and leatte in
first of all to the kingdom of heaven. The Scribes and the Phariseis have
contynually Messiah in their mouth, they have the law evermore in their
mouth, they have righteousness always in their mouth, they keep often and
much in the temple, they tarry long in their prayers, they fast often, they
walk up and down, notably besene with their broad phylacteryes, but they hide
in their hearts a thing far contrary to that that they show in outward
semblaunce. But the wily and wicked thoughts of such, the light of the truth
of the gospel when it aryseth, shall plainly find out and detecte.
Publicanes, harlottes, and sinners, are by these counterfaictes of holyenesse,
debarred from all sacres or holy rites of the temple: But such shall god
receive first of all into the kingdom of heaven. The Gentiles which have
been given to idolatry, suddenly changing their life, shall with gredy zeal
and affeccion enbrace the doctrine of true godliness: the Phariseis and
Bisshops in whose hands and power the keye of the ^awe and of relygyon did
rest, shall with most obstinate endeavor, resist it and be against it. The
night has no perfect judgment of things, but often times instead of the
things selfs it shows to the iye the only shadows and vain counterfaites
of things: but the sun, when it is up and gives clear light, it dryueth
away all blind casting of mistes before men's iyes, showing every thing in
his own likeness, and giving to every thing his own color. All this did
that same godly old manne speak, rejoicing and making glad chere from the
botome of his heart, which the holy ghost had thoroughly enspired.

Now had the lord Jesus received witness of his cumming into this world, of
Angels: of the virgyn Marie: of her spouse Joseph, who had never had to do
with her: of zachary being a priest: of the young babe John being yet in his
mothers woumbe unborn: of Elizabeth being a married woman: of shepeheardes: of
wyise men called Magians: of Scribes, who gave undoubted sentence and
judgment out of the prophecy, in what place Christ should be borne: of
Herod being in dread and fear lest some eiuyll should grow to him by
Christ's natiuytie: of Symeon, who was neither pryeste, ne leuite, but an
upright living man and nothing else: now remained that he might have semblable
testymonie of a wedowe too. So great was the efficacye and virtue of this
young babe not yet showing furthe his full might and power, that he rauyshed
all things with the spirit of God, enspiryng the humble and poor sort with
the holy ghost, stryekyng the proud with sore trouble of mind and with
fear, so that of these preambles of things it might without any dyfficultie
be gathered, what change of the world was lykelye in time coming to be,
when the same child being once come to full age, would openly utter forth
that same godly voice of his: and when he should through doing miracles daily
more and more wear famous: wha^ he should dye and arise again to life: and
when he should plenteouslye power furthe the holy ghost from heaven upon all
such as believed on him. So then next after an old manne that had long time
lived without any wife, follows and old woman that had many years lived a
wedowe without an housbande. For a certain woman there was, called Anna,
which had that name given her of the thing that was in her, that is to say,
of Grace, for hyghlye endued she was with the spyryte of prophecye. She was the
daughter of Phanuell being a man of good fame and much commended, And there
was a prophetisse one Anna. etc.
and of the tribe of Aser: which trybe being the eight in order among the
twelve, does under a certain pryuie figure, sygnifye the blyssednesse of the
resurreccyon, which solemnytye the doctrine of the gospel has added to the
hallowyng of the Sabbothes that the Jews did use. For Aser in Hebrew, is as
much to say in English, Which was of a great age.
as Blissed. This Anna in that she was so far stryeken in age, seemed to have
been delayed from dying and preserved in this life for none other purpose, but
that being an old woman, she might (according as she had before times with
most feruente prayers wyshed and desired) see the young babe, that was
promised, which should bring health and salvation to the people of Israel.

For the holy ghost had put in her mind, that he was already borne, and
even by the same suggestion of the spirit of God, which Symeon had tofore
been enspired withal, came this Anna upon them even in the veraye same hour
while these things which we have already told, were in doing within the
temple. And she had lived with an houseband seven years from her virginity.
This Anna in the time when virginity was not yet honorable, neto be gloryed
of, among the Jews, had lived with an housbande of her own by the space of
seven years from her maydenhood. So much time she was content, because of the
custom, to bestow in having an housbande for brynging furthe of children. But
all the resydue of her life she consecrated to the only serving of god in
contemplacion. For she continued in the state of wedowhod about the space of
fourscore and four years. After that she had once assayed wedlock, although
she were yet of lusty age, and in the veraye flower of her time, yet had she
no manyer mind ne thought to marrye any more again, but eue^ as a woman being
dead to the world, Which departed not from the temple. etc.
and now wholly dedicated unto god, she almost never departed from the temple,
but was there busilye, doing sacrifice unto him with euangelical oblacions, not
only in the day time but also by night, offering herself unto the lord a
lively, a reasonable, and an acceptable host. And she came forth the same
hour. etc.
For her body she offered with often fasting, and her soul with devout
meditacyons and prayers. And even while the aforesaid rytes and ceremonies of
purificacion were in doing within the temple, in the very hour while Symeon
is in his prophetycall talk, in the veraye momente while all things are full
of holy and godly words, both of rejoicing and of thanks geuyng for this
heavenly young babe: this Anna too, (even as god would have it) comes among
them, that she also might be a witness of the same child, that borne he was,
and that she might join the affeccyons of her heart with the ioyfulnesse of
the others, extollyng and hyghelye praysyng the bounteouse goodness of god for
that he had cast so merciful an iye upon his people. Neither did she, when
she was in coumpaigny and presence of others, keep secret the thing that she
had seen with her iyes, and the which she had learned by Gods
inspiracyon: but she would evermore be speaking and talking of this child,
unto all such as were in Jerusalem, and looked for the redemption of the
people of Israel. And this was enough for a womanne being a wedowe, only in
the temple to talk and to auouche that Christ was come, and the same to
entimate and disclose unto a few persons abroad being desyrouse and hungry
of it. For that same time was not yet come, which was reserved for the Apostles
when they should be replenished with the holy ghost, of the which Apostles it
is said in the Psalm of David: Into all the yearthe is their son gone
forth, Psalm. xix.
and their words into all the ends of the world throughout.

All things being at the last fully and ordrely executed, as much as the law
of Moses had prescribed for the purificacyon of women late delivered of
child: they returned into Bethleem, where the child was borne. But when king
Herod being done to wete by the Magians, that there was a new king of the
people of Israel borne, had commanded all the infantes to be flayne, as many
as within two years day, next before passed, had been borne in Bethleem, and in
all the circuit of the same lordeship or county: Joseph being advertised and
warned in his sleep so to do, conueighed away prieuelye both the child and
the mother that bore it, Into Galilee to their own city Nazareth.
into Egipte, and there made their abode until the death of the wieked king.
That thing done, they eftesons returned at the warnyng of an angel, not into
Bethleem, lest some occasyon of showing ferther cruelty might perchance
thereby have been given to the son of Herod (who had at that time succeeded
his father, in a portion of his kingdom) but they returned into the countreye
of Galyle, unto the city of Nazareth, And ye child grew. etc.
where the babe was first conceived in his mothers woumbe. For his mind was
to live in a corner out of the way for a time: and in deed keeping himself in
the poor city of Nazareth* it was an easy thing for him to beguile the
cruelty of them that dredde the arising of a new king. And thus hitherto that
same our heavenly sovereign lord and prince, who had for our sakes adbassed
and humbled himself down even to swadlyng cloutes, to the cradle, to crying
in his swathing bands as other children do, and to the strengthlesse
babehoode of the body, was preached and declared to the world by the only
testymonie of other folks talkyng. But his age by little and little growing up,
did from time to time increase the bygnesse of his stature, and the strength of
his body: in which body as in a tabernacle, there clearly appeared a certain
wonderful towardness and natural inclinacion to virtue, evidently declaring
that somewhat there was in him, more then a man. The strength also of the
spirit continuallye increased in him, daily more and more showing it self
forth in his countenance, in his pass, in his talk, and in his doings: in
all which, there was not so much as any one poincte, but it was even full of
the spirit of myldenesse and humylytie, of chastytie, of amyablenesse, and of
godly zeal. For he was nothing subject to those vices, which the years of
childehood is commonly woonte to be encoumbred with: that is to wete, And was
filled with wisdom.
fondenesse of speaking, and doing things, wantonness, inconstauncie, and
folly: but the heavenly wisdom wherewith he was replenyshed, not tarying for
the years and age that discrecion ought to be in, did even than already in
such wise show it self, that whereas he was before commended, and set furthe by
the testimony of others, now by his own virtues and gifts of grace (being
such as few other men had,) he was made both wonderful to all persons, and
also worthy to be loved. Wisdom, holiness, perfeccyon of living, ripeness
of discression, being in him such and so great as cannot in any other man of
right aunciente years be found, made him wondrefull unto all men: and the
delectable sweetness of his conuersacyon, his ientle familiare facyon toward
all folks, and his humble softness, made him unto all men am^able. Neither
was the favor that men did bear him, favor of the common sort, or for a
little season, such as that same age of chyldehoode does often times gather
through humayne qualities, (as in exaumple, for the respect of beauty and
welfauourednesse, or otherwise for aptitude and quickenesse of taking that is
taught them, which is in some children before their time) but in him there
shined a certain godly and wondrefull grace, mightily drawing all men to the
love of his vertuousenesse.

And although Nazareth was somewhat far in dystaunce from Jerusalem, yet
nevertheless the parents of Jesus being folks of much devotion, went
thither every year once, and that was at the festival day of Estur, which
feast was among the Jews kept high and holy with all possible devotion and
solemnity. And this was the day, at which that same lamb not knowing any
manier spotte of sin, was marked and appointed to be offered up in sacrifice
at his due time. The child also being under the guydyng of his mother, and
his fosterfather, even than as young as he was, accustomed himself to devout
serving of god, for our ensaumple: putting all fathers and mothers in
remembrance of their duties, who are bound to restreigne their children that
are come of them, from all wantonness even at the first day, yes even in
their veraye cradles, and the same to enure to holy conversation and to
earneste applying of true godliness, while their age is yet tender, and their
natural disposicion yet ientle, soft, and plyaunte unto all manier traynyng
in virtue. The child Jesus neded not the scoolyng or ordreyng of any other
person: but it was an exaumple ordained for other parents, how to bring up
their children chastelye and vertuouslye: and also a form or trade showed
unto all young children, how they ought to use themselves obedient to their
parents, And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem.
when they are by the same exhorted and aduertysed to things that are holy
and godly. But when his chyldehood by reason of a more noumber of years, was
now grown to a little more strength, and begoon to draw well toward the
stature of a young strieplyng, he being of the full age of twelve years old,
and his patentes, according to the auncyente custom had gone to Jerusalem at
the day of Estur, and the child awaytyng on them in their compaygny: as soon
as al things were finyshed that to the solemn obseruyng of that feast did
appertain, and the days throughlye expired, in which due attendaunce must
be given to the dyuyne service in the temple: whereas his mother and Joseph
were returned homewarde toward Nazareth, The child Jesus abode still in
Jerusalem.
the child Jesus remained still at Jerusalem: even than before his full age,
showing himself glad and ready to accomplish the commandments and message
of his father, for the doing whereof he had been sent into the world. But his
parents knew nothing of his tarying behind. But when they saw that he came
not home again to Nazareth, they according to the common rate of care that
other parents take for their children, greatly mused and wondered, what had
befallen. And in deed at the first, they demed that he had hanged on the
compaignye of some of his fellows and kinsfolks, and by reason thereof had been
the slacker in cumming. They geat them therefore back again even the same way
that they had come, to the mountenau^c^ in manyer of one whole days iourneye,
making search for him emonge their acquayntaunce and kinsfolks, in coumpany
of whom such little children are often times woonte to make taryaunce and
lyngeryng, because the affeccionate desire of their kinsfolk, or alliance,
does commonly keep them back and makes them to tarry. And when they found him
not they went etc.
But emongst al these, was Jesus not found, who taught men even than already
as young as he was, that such an one as is willing to take upon him the
profession and teaching of heavenly doctrine, must renounce and clearelye
forsake all worldly or carnal affeccyons both of father and mother and also
of kinsfolks. Their hope therefore being beguyled in sekyng Jesus here among
his kynsfolkes, And it fortuned that after three days they found him in the
temple. etc.
now that carfulness for their child did somewhat more earnestely prick
and vex their stomachs (as in tender parents it will do) back they went
again to Jerusalem, deming and supposing it to be possible enoughe, that he
had there remained still in the house of some friend or acquayntaunce of
theyrs. But when the child was in vain sought here also among their
acquayntaunce and kynsfolkes: after three days space, it chanced, that his
parents when they had no such hope at all, found him in the temple, not
idle, nor playing this or that childishe toye: but sitting still in the mids
among the doctors, whom he being but a child, did by course both hear
teaching, and also did appose, and being by course opposed of them again, did
make answer: not for that it was needful for him to demand of any mortal
creature what to learn: but to the end that by wisely ministering his
opposicions, he might rightely enstructe and teach them, that professed the
perfect knowelage of the law, whereas in deed they knew not the strength, the
pith, and the effect of the law^ and all under one, enflamyng us unto an
earneste zeal to take good instytucyons: and also geuyng a good lesson, that
no age is over young or over soon put to the learning of such things, as
may avail or serve toward godly perfeccion. For some arts and occupacyons
there be which every age is not apt, but over young, to learn: only
devotion and godliness is to be learned by and by from the cradle, and the
earneste dilygence in applying the same, not to be slacked or releassed at any
time until the veraye last day of a man's life. For there is in it higher
degrees and higher to grow unto, And all that heard him were astouned at his
understanding and aunswers.
as long as a man's life does endure. And as for Jesus, although he were
unknown both to the doctoures and also to the people that stood about, yet
did he make them all to merueyle at him, that being a child of a small age, and
stature, he could in his sayings and aunswers show forth a certain
wonderful wisdom: yea and far excedyng the wisdom of sage old men.
They saw the age of his body to be tender, and far unripe to have any
great wisdom, and they heard a young child with singular humility and
sobrenesse, uttering forth and speaking such things, as the great doctoures of
auncyente years, and they that seemed now to be as high in wisdom as any men
might be, thought not tedyouse to learn. And yet all the while there was in
him no pride ne haultenesse, there was in him no malapertenesse of cockyng or
geuyng tauntes, there was in him no mannier hosting or vau^nting of himself,
which vices are not wont to lack in boys whose wits are ripe before their
time. But he would question with them, as one desyrouse and feign to learn:
and being demanded any questyon, he would answer with all possible
sobrenesse, yea and also with most excellent wisdom. And on this mannier
taught he them without any spyce or semblaunce of arrogancy, that is to
say, of presumpteouse taking of authority upon him. And by these things it
came to pass, that as well the doctoures with whom he disputed, as also the
parties that stood round about and were witnesses of the same disputacion,
were veraye much astouned, not only for respect of the chyldes wisdom,
(being such as had not before been heard of,) which he in demaundyng any
questyon, and in shapyng any answer, did plainly declare: but also for the
^^re and syngulare sobrenesse of his countenance, of his gesture, and of his
tongue, which things gave a more ferther grace of acceptacyon unto his
understanding. And yet is not this poyncte neither without a fruictfull
mysterye, that Jesus, who could not with any seking be found among his
familiare acquaintance and kynsfolkes after the flesh, was sodaynelye found
by chance at Jerusalem within the temple. For the said city of Jerusalem,
being of great name and fame, (by reason that the world had conceived an
opinyon, that god was served there best of all places,) did represent as well
the church militaunte on yearthe, as also triumphaunte in heaven. For this
same Jerusalem is our country that we make all our sighyng to be at,
forasmuch as we do well understand that here in this transytorye world, we
live but as it were in a place of exile or banyshemente, not having a city
wherein to dwell for ever. Whersoeuer therefore all goes by carnal affeccyons
of man, wheresoever the earneste study of the mind is applied unto such
things as perish and dye with this world, in such a place neither is
Jerusalem (which Hebrew word is to say in English, the sight of peace,)
neither a temple dedicated to the Lord. And therefore is not Jesus in any
such place to be sought, who is altogether heavenly. But wheresoever is a
breast and an heart, which despyseth tho things that pertain to the
carnalytie of fleashe and blood, and pants for haste that he makes toward
that same blessed tranquillity and quietness of mind, which the bounteouse
goodness of god does through the faith of the gospel assure and warraunte
even here in this present life, and makes perfect in the heavenly
Jerusalem above, in such a place is Jerusalem: in such a place is the
temple that Jesus is delited with: in such a place there is both propounyng
of questyons and aunsweryng enterchaungeablye, not concerning how a round
circle may be made just four square, not of that which in Aristotle's
philosophy is called Ma^eria prima, (as if ye should say in English the
first original stuff whereof and out of which all things in the world are
produced and made) nor of that that the same Aristotle and other do call
primum mobile (whereby they mean him that governs the world, and rolleth
the sky about without beginning or ending, not naming it god but estemyng it
to be some other natural thing of it self) of all which things a man may
be ignorant, and yet come to heaven well enough: but in such place as we
speak of, the opposycyons and aunsweres are concerning the knowlage of holy
scripture, by the which god shows unto us, the way whereby we may attain
everlasting salvation. In such a place are slain hosts and sacrifices most
acceptable unto god, that is to wete, carnal lust, envy, wrath, desire of
worldely auauncemente, and avarice. In such a place there is with all godly
peticyons and with pure prayers, contynuall burning of sweet sauoures and
incence to the most high contentacyon and pleasyng of god. It is therefore the
part of every body to see and provide that he have Jerusalem within his own
breast, and that he there make ready a temple mete for the holy ghost, to the
end that he may be worthy to have Jesus to his geaste,

And behold, even in the mean time while the said merueilouse child Jesus
does with this foundation and entreing make a preparatiue to the executing of
the heavenly business of restoring mankind to salvation, which to do he
was come down from heaven: his father and mother comes sodaynely in place,
to whom the mystery of gods intent and purpose was not yet fully known.
There was yet still remaynyng in them, some little spyece of humayne affeccion,
although they had with a natural loving carfulness, sought about for the
child. And Joseph for his part holds his peace, who knew very well in his
conscience, that he had no right ne title to the child that his spoused wife
had borne: Son* why have thou thus dealt with us?
but the mother, as she thought she might well do by authority, makes half
a querele to him: Son, says she, why do ye handle us after such sort as
this? why did ye prieuelye steal away from us? lo, your father and I being
now by the space of two or three days in great care and heaviness, have
been seeking all about for you, fearing on your behalf the daungier and peril
of all such misaduentures, as the natural tenderness of parents does
commonly use to fear the chauncyng of, unto their children that they love,
And he said unto them: how is it yt ye sought me?
when they be absente from them. To these words of Marie, which had proceeded
of an affection in deed right tender and natural, but yet somewhat humayne and
worldelye (for respect whereof it was not conueniente to interrupte or break
the godly talk, that was than in hand) Jesus answered half roughelye: not
that he was in any fume or indignacion with his parents, but to show, that
in the affairs of the gospel, (which to do he was sent of his heavenly
father,) no mannier authority of any man (what ever he be) ought to have place.
The auctorytie of parents over their children has certain due lymytes and
bounds how far it may extend, which autoritye it is lawefull and also
necessary to renounce and utterly forsake, as often as any matier of eternal
salvation comes in place. For mete it is, that things worldelye give place
unto godly things, and that the respect and regard of God (to whom we are
bounden debtoures as well of body as of soul, and of whose bounteouse
lyberalytie we look for the inherytaunce of the life everlasting,) be above
them, of whom after the flesh we are borne and brought up, to succeed them,
but in some porcyon of good and substance worldely. In deed greatly bounden we
are even to our parents too: but a great deal more are we bound to god, to
whom we are bound even that ever we had any fathers or mothers at all. So
likewise at an other time after this, he made an answer not all of the
ientyleste manyer unto his mother, when she at a marriage spoke unto him, and
moved him of some wine for the feast, and did with a certain autory^ie,
because she was his mother, Luc. viii. Math. xii. Matt. iii.
require him to show a miracle, whereas miracles were not to be showed but to
the glory of his heavenly father. So did he also at an other time more snappy
shelye make answer unto them, that from preaching the gospel, called him
forth of the throng and press of the people, in the name of his mother and of
his kynsfolkes. But the answer that he made at this time, was in manier and
form here following. What was the cause (quod he) why ye did with such
pensyfe carfulness seek about for me? did ye not remember in your minds
that I must needs be about my fathers business, Wist ye not that I must go
about my fathers business.
as often as he calls me to the office and function appoyncted unto me? But
what thing these words of Jesus might mean, his parents did not even veraye
well understand. For it expressed in him a certain excellency above the
common rate of a man, especially at such a tender age of childehood. And
albeit that of a likelyhod of things that had before passed, they looked for no
common trade, ne yet no mean thing at the hands of their child: yet for all
that did they not fully and thoroughly understand the high excellencye and
majesty of the power of god, And they understood not that saying which he
spoke unto them.
they did not yet perfectely know by what wonderful dryfte and
conueyghaunce, god the father had determined to redeem mankind by his own
son. They heard in these words of Jesus, a namyng of his father, where as
they very surely knew that he had no father in this world on earth: they
hear him speak of his fathers affairs and business, of which affairs he
had never spoken word ne made mention to them before that day. But they,
though they were the parents, are all hushte, and speak not a word, but do
reverently take the words which they understood not. And Jesus seeing this,
humbled himself and showed himself obedyente to his mother and to Joseph his
foster father: not that he oughed unto the^ any duttie of obedyence, but of his
own goodness he submytted himself for a season to their weakness, to be
ruled and ordered by them: and therewithal he also gave unto all children a
form and an exaumple, with what earneste endeavor and with what great
reverence, they ought to be at their parents commandment: forasmuch as
the child Jesus, who oughed no service ne obedience to any body, saving only
to his heavenly father, did in such wise obey a father that was but
counterfey^te and his mother that bore him without any harm or dyspleasure of
empayryng her chastytie and maydenhood thereby. Thus did the Lord Jesus think
it good, in such wise to temper all his sayings and doings: that now he
would show furthe, (as ye would say,) certain little sparks of his godly
power: and an other time again would he humble himself to the low degree of
a man, poorly borne into this world. Uerayly his so doing was expediente for
us, to the end that it might by all mannyer ways be persuaded unto mankind,
the verity and true substance both of the dyuyne nature and of the nature of man, to be coupled together in his one person. The feloweshyppe of a nature
being common both to him and us, did greatly make for the purchasing of love.
We do more earnestly and also more fruictfully love things that be nere to
our own nature and family are to deal with: even by the old proverb,
which says: that like will evermore unto like. But as for puttyng our
affiaunce and trust, we do more safely put it in god, who, (forasmuch as
lie he cannot and is of power all things to do,) may in no manyer wise be
doubted of, but that he will perform whatsoever he does promise. And in
deed our love toward Christ does first spryng up of the cousynage and
likeness of our nature: but from these beginninges it grows better and
better to the love of things being higher above us. For like as the common
sort of men, is at the first beginning by the only seeing of the beauty
of ones body, enflamed and set on fire, to bear his good will to the
party, and shortly after, when by keeping of coumpanye and by talkyng with the
same party, the good qualytyes of a more beautyfull mind and soul lying
hydden in his beautiful body, are once throughelye perceived, they begin
more truly and also more ardentelye to be in love with the thing that they
see not, then with the thing that they see: even so the feloweshyppe and
equalitye of our humayne nature in him, was unto us, as ye would say, a lure
to the conceyuyng of love toward the Lord Jesus, but from this love we grow
up more higher to the love of his divine power, and of his godhede. Therefore
whether he humble himself down to our weakness, or else mounteth up to his
own highness above, he busilye attends the labouryng and working of our
health and salvation. So than Jesus went from the temple and from Jerusalem:
and obeying the governance of his pare^tes, returned home again to Nazareth.
Let children and young strieplinges when they hear this, be ashamed, as many as
make light at the good lessons and counsayles of their parents exhortyng them
to honest ways, seeing that Jesus did for a space leave of from dooyng his
fathers business, because he would not show any exaumple of a disobedyent
son. Let the private commoners and parisheners blushe, that use to rebel
against their godly pastoures, being their spiritual fathers: seeing that
Jesus being the greater in dygnytie, was content to be ordered by his
inferiors, and being God, submytted himself to the governance of creatures
mortal. But the mother again on her part, forasmuch as she perceived and
found a certain power of the goddeheade to glittre and show furthe in him,
But his mother kept al these sayynges together in her heart.
was well content to follow the mind and ordering of her son: and being
myndefull of her own wise and discrete sobrenesse, did as yet make no blabbyng
out abroad of any thing (as other weomen use to be full of clatteryng and
bablyng) ne take upon her to give any sentence or judgment upon these
matiers, which she did rather merueyle at, then understand the mystery of
it, what it mente: but all that ever had chanced from the beginning about or
concerning the child, and all that ever was by him said or dooen, she
gathered and conferred altogether, and laid it up safe in her breast:
coniecturyng and castyng of these wonderful begynninges, what end of all
mattyers was like to ensue. Neither did she leave any one poyncte unmarked, to
the end that she might afterward with the more perfect truethe and
assurance, make report of all things unto the dyscyples, that should in
time cummyng preach the life of Jesus all the world throughoute. In the mean
while Jesus being yet hitherto known but unto few folks, continued dwelling
in ye poor city of Nazareth, living (as ye might say) under the governance
of his parents, until the time should come, that was set of his father, in
which he should with miracles and with preaching, show forth himself abroad
unto the world: giving to us in the mean while a lesson by his own exaumple,
that no man should unadvisedly and vndyscretely, or else out of time and
without due occasyon come rushing in, or make press to take in hand thoffice
of preaching the gospel, before that he do through sufficyente grows of
years, through vnculpable behauyoure, through due learning and knowleage in
holy scriptures, and through Gods vocacyon, gather unto himself a good
authority to become a teacher. And Jesus prospered in wisdom and age.
For Jesus until he was in mannier full thirty years of age, never did any
very notable act, saving that above the rate of other mortal men, like as he
grew and prospered in stature of body, in strength, and grows of years: so
did that same heavenly wisdom still more and more plenteouslye show furthe
it self in him, and so did his other manyfolde gifts of grace also, through
which, like as he was most highlye accepted with god, so did he daily more
and more grow in favor and estimacion with men: an unlike manne veraylye
and of a much contrary sort unto the Scribes and Phariseis, who by a
counterfeite pretense of holiness and of wisdom, used to set out
themselves to the iyes of men, whereas in the syghte of god they were as full
as they might swarm of all filthe and vnclenesse of vice. Neither was it
only auayleable to the salvation of mankind, (who was to be redeemed by a
strange conueyghaunce, and such as the like had not been heard of before,)
but also to the good instruccyon and traynyng of our life, that Jesus did by
little and little, and by certain degrees, show forth to the knowledge of men,
his heavenly gifts of grace that he was most aboundauntly replenished withal.
For that thing verayly he did to give us a lesson that from those first
precepts and rules of righteousenesse, (which we ought, even straight way
while we be young cradle children, to drink in,) we should with continual
going forward vncessauntly, do al our possible endeavor to atteygne unto
things of more and more perfeccyon. For like as the body has his degrees of
growing bigger and bigger to the full rate of his stature, and to his full
strength, that is to were, shootyng up first from infancy or babehood to the
stature of a young strieplyng: from the stature of a striepling to the degree
of a young man: from the degree of youth, to the full perfeccyon of man's
state: even so has godliness his degrees of increasing, until we may be full
grown up to the perfect substauncyall strength of the fullness of Christ.
And in favor with god and man.
For Christ grows bygger and bygger in us, and shoots up more and more to
man's state, when we from the first enstruccyons and articles of the faith
do encroche forward to a more deep hydden wisdom of the scripture of God:
when we forsake the milk of the fleashe, and begin to have a stomach or
appetyte to the sound and strong meat of the spirit: when we leave the
unsavory letter, and thirste the mystycall sense and meaning: when we nothing
esteem ne regard things yearthly, but mount up and take our flight to
things celestial. For it is even plain setting the cart before the horses,
if the body shall by the course of nature grow from time to time forewarde to
better and beter, and the soul shall by our sluggyshenesse continually run
headlong backewarde to wurse and wurse. For thus do we see it commonly come to
pass. Big laddes and strieplynges grow quite away from the pureness of
babehood to boyishe wantonness, the youth than again grows forewarde a pace
to brabling in the law, and to making of affrayes, manstate emendeth to
ambicion and couetise. And so cummeth it to pass, that every manne the nerer
that he draws to the state of age, so much the ferther goes he backewarde
from innocence living. But such persons as have once put on Christ on their
backs, ought according to the exaumple of the same Christ, with all their
strength to heave forewarde unto better and better: to the end that they may
both with the pure clenesse of the soul make themselves acceptable in the
syghte of God: and also by the vncorruptnesse of their living, geat themselves
an honest fame and report among men.

The.iii. Chapter.

THou haste heard, good Theophilus, with what begynnynges both John the
forerenner, and also the lord Jesus made a way, and a preparatife unto the
office of preaching the gospel. Now hear by what means, and with what
success they enterprised, and entered the mattyer, to the end that thou may
well understand, that nothing was done by hap or casualtie, ne through
man's wisdom, but every whit by the providence of god, tempreing and ordreyng
his own mattyer after a new manier of facion of his own. For now was the
time already come, that the heavenly kingdom being revealed and published, the
worldly kingdom should abate and decay: the spiritual priestehood being
disclosed, the shadowie priestehood, (wherein the Jews had until that time
made many glorious vau^tes and braggues of themselfes) should vanishe clean
away. Ceasar the emperor of Rome surnamed Augustus, had now ended his life, by
whose proclamacio^ the whole world had before been surueied, and the names of
every body within the empire registered in books, and in the time of his
reygne Jesus Christ was borne. Wicked Herod also was now deceassed, who had
sought Jesus being an infant for to have slain him. And Archelaus Herodes son
for his behavior ouermuche rese^blyng his fathers wicked prankes, was exiled
from his kingdom into an other country. Tiberius Caesar had succeeded Augustus
in ye empire. And in the fiftenth year of his reign, Poncius Pilate a Romain
was president of Iewry. And Herod ye brother of Archelaus by the eleccion and
apointment of the said Tiberius the emperor, had Galilee allotted unto him.
Philip had the rule and governance of that part of Syria, which is called
Ituria: and it was called also Tra^honitis, of the roughness of the mountains,
because ye country is full of vphilles and dounhilles, and almost no part of
it even or plain chaumpian ground. For it goes al along in hills and dales
from Libanus, and from ye mou^tains of Idumea, unto ye west coaste of Syria.
Tha^ moreover ye part yt is called Abilena, (of Abila the principal city of
the same region,) was by assignement cum to the hands of Lisanias for his
porcio^, who afterward changed the name thereof, and called it Lysanio^. For
Augustus in his time, because he would so^what break and enfeble the puissaunt
force of that kingdom, had made a division of it, and distributed it among
four brethren, Herod, Philip, Antipater, and Lysanias, which therefore were
called Tetrarches, that is to say in English, the four princes or the four
head rulers. For the name of a king was long before abolished by a law of the
Romans, who would have no kings. And this was a token or rather a figure
that the kingdom of the Jews should shortly after vanishe away according to
the prophecy. But the holiest part of Iewrye (wherein Jerusalem and the
temple stood, and in which the lord of al was borne,) one Ponce Pilate a
Romain, had the administracion and governance of: being as it were a figure
plainly betokenyng even by the very case and thing as it stood, that the
Gentiles should break into the kingdom of heaven, which the Jews would reject
and utterly despise. Likewise the priesthode as a thing that should soon after
cease and have an end, went wandrynge and shifting from one to an other out
of due order, and was bought, and sold, and made eue^ a market matter, wherein
at that time two notable ungodly me^, Annas, and Caiphas had the highest and
the chefest roumes. Emiddes these matters of dividing and mangleyng the
country into sundry rewlers hands, and in the mids of this very troublesome
state of things emonge the Jews, the kingdom of heaven, and a new priesthode
sprang up, whereof John the soonne of Zachary was chosen and specially
appointed to be an open preacher and proclaymer. This John before lay hydden
among ye wild beasts, and passed a life of wonderful straightness, cladde
with a Camels ski^ne, girt with a belt of a rough leather thong, feeding upon
wild honey and grasshoppers of that country, not so much as tasting any wine
or strong drink, to the intent he might be a mete preacher of repe^tau^ce:
and might teach the people by his life, before he should teach them by his
words: and might be clear without al crimes himself, who should so freely
reprove the faults and transgressions of other me^: but now being inspired
with the holy ghost, and admonished by ye same, he came out of the dens of
wilderness, and gat him not into the temple, which place was reserved unto
Christ, but into al those quarters and coasts, And he came into all the costs
about Jordan. etc.
which lie about the river Iordane, to the end that he might have the more
plenty of water for such as should be baptized. And he preached that the kingdom
of heaven was at hand, exhorting that the people should prepare themselves to
the salvation, (which approached) thorough repentance of their former lives,
and that with the baptism of water (which he in his person gave, being but as
a foregoer and a messe^ger of Christ) they should make them selfs mete for the
baptism of ye spirit, which spirit he should give, whose cu^ming approached.
These things were tha^ done by inspiracion of the holy ghost, who long before
had prophesied the same by the mouth of Esai ye prophet. For in this manner
speaks he of John's preaching. The voice of a crier in ye wilderness, the lord
approaches, prepare his ways, make his paths straight, ieste being offended
with the untoward crokednes of your condicio^s and behavior, he spedily stert
back away from you. He cu^meth to al, al must go forth to mete him. All
things must be made plain and eue^. Every valey shall be filled up, and every
mountain and hill shall be brought down and made flat. They which were high
among me^, because they were in a great opinion and estimacion of righteousness,
or wisdom, shall abate their stately and proud countenance that they may be
hable and apt to receive the righteousness, and wisdom of God: and they
which as idiotes or me^ of no knowlage ne regard, and as sinners, were out of al
reputacio^, utterly despised as abiectes among me^, shall suddenly through
their obedience to the gospel, be raised up unto the fellowship and communion
of the kingdom of heaven: Such things also as tofore were warped and writhed
sundry ways, and stood all crooked, shall in a moment be made even and straight
again with the squiere of the ghospel: and where places were rough by reason of
the thorns of manifold vices, and naughty desires and lusts, they shall now
be made very smooth, and plain ways. For by and in such minds does the
lord love to walk. And to such extreme contraries shall the courses of all
things at the cummyng of him be changed. They that were in despair shall be
set up in coumforte and hope again. Such as trusted in themselfes, not caryng
for any other healper or saueour, shall be cast away and perish, impossible to be
recovered again. They that were before times esteemed and reputed for wise,
shall become fools: and such as were accoumpted for fools, shall be endued
with the gift of heavenly wisdom. They which to fore were idolatres, shall
becum true seruers and wurshippers of the living God: and they which in
outward semblaunce appeared to be true wurshippers of God, shall be found
idolatres. Those that before were wrathefull, shall be quiet of mind and
beneficial to others: and such as served the lusts of concupiscence and
lechery before, shall now love and enbrace all chastity. They which before
were pollers and catchers away of men's gooddes, shall now freely without sparynge
give away of their own. To this manne therefore that shall make such an
alteracion and change of things, prepare your selves. The lord will even
within a litell while be here present in this world: and not only ye Jews
shall see him, but all the nations of the whole world shall with the iyes of
faith behold him that is the autour and geuer of salvation: by and through
whom, God makes a free offer of the bliss of heaven, unto all such persons as
through godly promptness and readiness to believe, and through correccion and
ame^dment of their former lives, shall receive him when he cu^meth.

All this had Esai so many hundred years before prophesied of John: and nothing
there was, but in the end it came to pass, and proved agreeable unto the
prophecy in every behalf, and in every point. For at John's preaching, a
great multitude of people leaving their houses (and declaryng by the same their
doing as plainly as if they had spoken it in words, that who so ernestly
minds or desires to attain to salvation, must do away and forsake the
carnal affeccions that he has at home in the house of his heart,) did by
heaps resort unto the shore of fluime Iordane, that they might be diepped in
water by him: not that John was a forgeuer of sins, or could so do: but
because that he with this begi^nyng and preamble, did prepare folks hertes and
minds unto the rede^pcion and salvation that was cu^ming. For a good great
part and towardnes of health it is, to acknowlage ones self to be sick: and a
great advantage and foredele toward recovery has that person, which is
apt and willing to take that may be a remedy for his disease. And
forasmuch as the first step and degree to amendment springs out of the
fear of god, And he said to the people. etc.
(so that we first fear the just punishment at the hands of the righteous
auenger, and than love the liberality of so bou^teous a lord,) John cried out
with a great boldness and plainness against ye proud Phariseis, and Scribes,
who tofore had ever sticked fast and continued in the steps of their wicked
fathers, and through the false persuasion of righteousenes were puffed up in
pride, though they were strong enemies unto true religion, setting other me^ at
naught, and standing highly in their own conceytes, for none other cause so
much, as for the respect that they were descended of Abraham, by the lynage and
descent of the flesh, as though God esteemed men after their kindred or
lineage, and not rather according to the virtues and godly qualities of their
minds. O ye generation of vipers (says he) most vicious and corrupt
children, descended of most vicious and corrupt auncestrie: whereby have ye
perceived and found out that the vengeance of god hangs over you, unless ye
in season amend your lives? What person has given you any by warning or
watch word to flee from the most sharp punishment and scourge of god,
which shall spare no age, which shall pardone no nation, nor shall show
favor to no degree, or estate of men high or low? Like as remedy is offered
unto all such as will yield themselfes to be cured and healed: so does
punishment abide all persons indifferently without excepcion, as many as
refuse to amend from their old naughty behavior and conversation. Why did not
entier love toward god allure you hither before, as well as the fear and
dread of punyshemente does violently hale you hither now at this present?
your minds and hearts are as yet nothing changed at all. Wherefore if ye
without any feynyng or dissimulacion be penitent and sorry for your wicked life
past, change your conditions, and be ye of an other sort of conuersacio^, the^
heretofore ye have been, and declare plainly by your very doings, that ye are
reformed and emended. Ye have unto this day hitherto like wild trees, brought
forth the sour and pestilent fruits of evil works, that is to wete, pride,
wrathfulnesse, avarice, envy, hypocrisy, and contencio^. Now if ye be in very
deed turned from evil trees into good trees: bring ye forth good fruits,
such as may testyfy your hertes to be truly altered into a better frame. It
is not here now requisite nor any thing material that ye change your
garments, or to leave and take this or that kind of meat, but ye must change
the evil lusts of your hertes. This is in very deed the root of the tree,
which root if it have a bitter and a venomous sape, tha^ spring there none but
evil fruits out of ye branches: but contrariwyse if the root minister and
send up a pleasant and wholesome sape to the boughs, than do there grow forth
upon the branches those fruits of the spirit, that are semely for god, and
worthy acceptacion, that is to wete, entier love instede of hatred: for bitter
frouning, godly joy and lightness of heart: for discord, peace, for fiercenes,
sufferaunce: for snatchyng and polling liberality: for lecherousnes,
chastity: for deceitful craftines, simplicity and plain dealyng: for
presu^pteous taking upon him, humble sobrenes: for supersticion, true
godliness. These are the things which declare who be the true and
vncounterfayted Jews: these be the things that declare who be circumcysed as
they ought to be, and who are the very true children of Abraham in deed, these
sacrifices they are, that god is delyted withal.

And begin not to say with your selves: we have Abraham to our father.
Now is the light at hand, let shadows pass away: the truth is in place,
away with all counterfeit hypocrisy: do away your vain confydence which the
fygures of ghostely things have nouryshed in you, and not the things selfs:
as for exaumple, when ye say in the way of gloriyng: Jerusalem that holy city
of ours: the lords temple, the lords temple, the lords temple: also such
figures of things as here follows, that is to wete, slaughter of brute
beasts in sacrifice: ordeining and solemn halowing of sabbath days:
obseruyng of new moons: choice and difference between one meat and an other,
broad borders upon vestures (which ye call your philacteries) fasting and
abstinence, with heuinesse and louring of countenance: and the resydue of
obseruaunces a great many, which either the law did for a time prescribe and
apoint as figures of things, to be referred to the mind: or else ye Phariseis
have inverted for a vain pretense of holiness: al these things every one, with
circumcision it self, and altogether, shall cease and be abolyshed. And such
an one shall from hensfoorth be esteemed for a Jew of the right sort,
whatsoever he be, that shall confess and acknowelage him, whose coming shall
now ere long be seen to the world. And such an one shall be taken for a man
rightly circumcised as he should be, whosoever shall have an heart pourged
through faith, from all inordinate lusts and desires. Let it therefore no more
enter into your hertes to think with your selves vaingloriously: It is we that
are the heritage, the succession and children of Abraham, it is we and none
else, to whom the inheritance of salvation has been promised, the Lord will
not forsake us that are his people. Nay I say unto you, that like as the
wickedness of your forefathers shall be nothing prejudicial nor hurtful to you,
in case ye amend and take better ways: even so shall the holiness of your
progenitour Abraham nothing avail you, if ye will still continue in your old
ungodliness. Ye will be cast away, ye will surely be disherited, ye will
utterly perish to eternal damnacion, unless being converted and turned to
better life, ye bring forth such fruits, as may semely and worthily stand
with the gospel. Neither shall Abraham be destitute of posterity or
succession, God is able of these stones to ceise vy children unto Abraham.
nor god want a people of his own, of who^ to be condignely wurshipped and
served, and to whom to perform the inheritance by him promised, though ye
should shrink and fall away from him. For this dare I be bold to auouche and
assure unto you, God is not unable, but has power enough, even of these
stones here, to reise up children unto his friend Abraham, to whom he promised
issue and succession, like in noumbre to the sands of the sea, and to the
sterres in the sky. In time herafter to cum, the children of Abraham shall be
esteemed and accepted, not after the kindred of blood, but as every one shall
follow, and resemble Abraham in faith. Abraham shall acknowelage and accept for
his children, even the Sogdia^s, the Gotthyans, and the wild Scythians, if
they embrace Messiah: and shall coumpte and repute you for aliens and strange
borne bastardes, unless ye turn to the faith and believe. God has hitherto
showed patience and sufferau^ce toward you, though ye have but eue^ so so
brought forth ye outward fruits of the law, such as they were: that is to say,
sacrifices, vows, fasti^ges, washinges, difference of meats: and paryng away
of the foreskin in circumcision. But these things had no more but
superficially an outward apparaunce of religion. And these are but leaves of
the tree, detestable before God, except ye fruits of the spirit be joined
therewith. But now from hensfoorth shall every body be esteemed according to the
true treasures of the heart and the soul even as they shall be found good or
evil.

Now is there cum a more straight and precise judgment of God: and cum he is,
Now also is the are laid to the rotes of the trees.
that sees the botome of the depest secrets of the heart. For now is the axe
even ready set hard by ye root of the tree, that has so long time been
suffered. Abraha^s people shall be hewed away from the stem thereof, and the
heathen (so many as in prompte readynes of believing shall resemble Abraham)
shall be graffed in their places. Moses had no ear given unto him: the
prophets were not harkened unto, of whom a great many ye slew and put to
death: at the voice of the law, ye have hitherto been of dull and deaf ears:
now is he cum, Every tree therefore. etc
whose greater there can none be sent, and after whom there is none to be
looked for. Utter peryshing for ever hangs over the whole nation of the
Israelites* except ye repent betime and grow to more goodness: For every tree
which shall not now bring forth the good fruit of faith, shall be felled down,
and cast into the fire. Mean is there none, nor respect is there none: but
either through true godlynes, to make haste unto everlasting salvation: or not
so doing, remediles and utterly to be damned for ever.

The common multitude of the Jews being sore adrade with these terrible, and
manacing words of John, said unto him: If it be so as ye say, what think
ye than good for us to do, whereby to avoid and escape the wrath of God, and
to atteyn salvation? Now began they to wax sumwhat curable and toward to be
healed, when they acknowlaged their diseases, and earnestly desired remedy.
John therefore shows them a remedy of perfect strength and efficacy at all
assayes. For he calls them not ne exhorts them to the sacrifices of
beasts, and such other judicial means of pourging their sins: but unto
the works of charity. God is with no sacrifice in the world more sooner
pacified, then with beneficial doing to our neighbor. God has no need of any
benefits of ours, but he suffers it to be rekened as done to himself,
whatsoever we bestow upon our neighbor being in necessity and need. He that
has two coats (says John) let him cover his naked brother with the one of
the^. He that has two coats, etc.
And he that has as much meat as may suffice for twain, let him give half
thereof to an other that is hungry. With these two exaumples John taught the
people of the gross and blockishe ignorant multitude, that the most strongest
and effectual mean to appeace God being offended with us, is, if we by all
means be fra^ke and bountiful in doing good to our neighbor, whatsoever thing
he has need of: whether it be apparel, or meat, or drink, or harbourgh, or
aid and succor against violence, or coumfortable words in time of sorrow, or
doctrine for his instruccion, or good exhortacion and counsayll. And bounden we
be to help the present necessity of our brother, not only with part of those
things whereof our selfs have superfluity or more then we need, but also we
ought to cut of a little share of such things, as might otherwise stand us in
good stead for our own uses and occupiyng, as often as our neighbors
necessity requires present help out of hand. This remedy than it was that
was given by John to the common multitude, which remedy nevertheless serves
for all men indifferently.

Than came also the Publicans, that is to say, the customers and takers up of
tolles, being semblably stryken with great fear of John's preaching, whereas
otherwise they were a kind of people given to pollyng, and rauine, and getting
all that they might for their own singular advantage, and lucre, with all
others men's loss and damage, and hinderaunce, me^ nothing passing on
religion or on the fear of God, but more ready to obey the commandments of
worldly princes, then the precepts of God: which sort of men, where as they
have an evil name among all nations, and be commonly ill spoken of, yet among
the Jews they were specially above al other sorts of men abhorred and repu^ed
abominable. And yet ye sore sharp preaching of John had stryken such an
horrible great fear into them all, that even they too, as evil as they were,
came to John, requiryng baptism, and desiring to learn how and what way they
might appeace the wrath of god. And John ye true foregoer and messenger of him,
who would drive back or put away no man (were he never so much spotted or
defiled with sin) made a soft and a ientle answer even to Publicans also: if
ye cannot yet (says he) find in your hertes to give out to the poor and
nedye sum part of that that is your propre own: yet at lestwise make ye this
one step toward a better life, that from hensforth ye hold your hands
from pollyng and catchynge away the goods of other men. Ye have an annual
stipende and an ordynary fee of Caesar: and it is rated out unto you by a plain
rule, how much or little ye ought to require of the people for any duty.

After the Publicans, came soldiers also, an vnruelye and an ungodly kind of
people, having no regard ne care of any laws, heady and hastye to do wrong,
and fellows that used to sell their life and solle for money, setting al their
delight and felicity in catching and robbing from other me^, fierce and
presumteous through ouermuche liberty and sufferaunce. Nevertheless the fear
of Gods vengeance fell upon these me^ too, and therefore they also came to John.
They acknowlaged their wicked state of soldiership (as they used it,) they
desire baptism, and require moreover to be enfourmed, what possible means
they might make, to have god appeaced to wards the^. It was surely in this
kind of men a great point of furtheraunce toward health, that they would
acknowelage their disease, and were pricked with desire of a better life.
Therefore John would not at the first day adventure to require in such as they
were, And he said unto them, hurt ye no man.
that they should show beneficial liberality toward their neighbor,
because he thought it to be a step sufficient and great enough for the first
setting forward toward God, if such as they were would honestly refrain and
keep themselves from doing mischief about in places where they ca^e. And to
speak more of this sort of me^, in deed they are wont to be noysom and
hurtful in three points especially, that is to wete, in violent oppression, in
laiyng to men's charges, and burdenyng them with false crimes: and in pillage or
robberye. For oftentimes the weapons which the princes have delivered unto them
for defense and maynteynaunce of the public tranquillity, they turn to the
hurt of their very own countreye men being true subjects, and do avenge their
own private malice with the same weapon, wherewith the safety of the wholle
people in general ought to have been defended. So that oftentimes they go on
theuing for booties, and spoil the country, they burn, they drive away
men's cattle, they ranishe weomen, they break up men's houses, they turn
the good man of ye house where they have been lodged or entertained, they turn
him clean out of his own doors, and pumble him about the pa^e.

And because they do oftentimes play these parts, and have nothing said nor
dooen to them for it, they think they may do it lawfully. Again, sum of them
promote false playntes against honest simple men before their princes or
captains, for none other purpose, saving that a portion of ye parties gooddes
being seized as a forfayte, may cum to their snapshare in reward of their
false accusacion maliciously and slanderously prepe^sed. And at such
ungracious prankes the princes do oftentimes wynke, while they ernestly tender
the gratifiyng of their servants. Furthermore sum of this sort of people,
when they prodigally consume and waste out upon harlots, upon dice, or in
bankettyng, and reuellyng at the wine, all that ever their Prince does in the
name of a fee or stypende allow them, they make up their loss again with
pillyng and pickyng: and do not only leave such duties as they owe still
unpaid, but also do by plain extorcion pull from poor house handmen that
that is no duty at all: and so under the name and color of war, they
think nothing what ever it be unlawful for the^ to do, whereas in very deed
there is a due law of arms serving for battle and war, which in deed is
not utterly to be disallowed, in case it be attempted for a just and a rightful
cause, that is to say, if it be made for ye defense and maynteinaunce of the
public tra^quillitie of a realm and country: if the case so stand, that it
cannot be avoided: if it be enterprysed by godly Princes: if with the consent
of them, for whose behofe it is expedient or necessary that ye war should be
made: if it have been denounced or proclaimed with all rytes and circumst^unces
according to the law of arms: if justice and moderacion be used in it, that
is to say, if war be so kept, with as much sparyng of bloodshed as possibly
may be: if as few be lost, as may be, especially of them that never gave any
cause to the war: if the unadvised witfulnes and hastines of the soldiers be
brideled by the captains: if there be no buckling together of the two armies,
saving only by such soldiers and me^ of arms as have given their oath before
to do as they ought to do and neue otherwise: nor without a sign to b^e given
by commandment of the capytayne when they shall buccle together in fight: if
every body immediately hold their hands from fightyng* as soon as ever the
tru^pe^tes have once blown retraicte: if also as soon as it possibly may,
the war be ended and so break up. Unto this sort of men therefore does
John nothing but show, what their accustomed use is to do, and what thing from
hensforth they ought to eschew, if they mind to escape the vengeance of God.
Stryke ne beat ye no man (says he) accuse no man falsely for lucres
sake: but be ye contented with your ordinary wages that is allowed you.

And with such great authority were the premises handled and done by John,
that the people begoonne half to be in opinion, that himself was the very
Messiah, of whose cummyng he preached unto the^. And this did a great many of
them with secret thinking cast in their hertes, though John on his own
behalf, by reason of his singular humility of heart, did as much as he could
to hide his own greatness. For this is the light and cockebrained fashion of
the common multitude, that such persons as they have a special mind and
regard unto, they set more price by, then there is cause or reason why: and
such as they bear hatred against, such do they most slanderously report,
finding fault with all things in the^. But this earnest good favor and
opinion of the people, did well declare very perfect humility in this most
holy man, who was so far from taking unto him the advantage of an other ma^s
praise, that he stoutely refused the same, being given unto him of the peoples
own voluntary offer. And the wrong opinion that the people were in, did much
good for this one point, that the dignity and worthynes of Christ being as
yet known but to a few, was there allowed with a substanciall and an open
testimony in the face of the world. For John as soon as he by inspiracio^ of
the holy ghost, well perceived the secret thoughts of the people, he spoke in
this manner: Sirs (says he) ye do esteem me by outward things that may be
seen, as for example, by the meat that ye se me eat, by my wede, and by this
that I do minister baptism unto you: but the things that be not seen, are a
great deal more effectual, even after the same rate as in a man the virtue of
the mind which is not seen, is of much more dignity and worthiness, then
the power of the body which is seen with men's iyes.

I on my behalf, I baptyse you with water.
though I do baptize you with water, yet am I no remitter of sins, I am no
more but a preparer of you to a baptism of more efficacy and virtue, which ye
shall receive at the hands of him, whose cumming I preach unto you, being as
in deed I am sum what his elder in time, and su^what before him in order and
course of preaching: but in power a great way inferior unto him. For he that
cummeth after me, is so far better the^ I, that I (whom ye all believe to be
sum great high manne of price) am unworthy to vnbuccle the larchet of his
shoes. And I am his servant, not his fellow: I am a foregoer unto him, but
even of much like rate, as ye day sterre goes before the sun, and shall anon
after be darkened and drouned with ye greater light of the sun when it
cu^meth. And eue^ very this that I have, I have of his bounteous goodness. My
doctrine is but very wash, if it be compared unto his doctrine: my baptism
is of no virtue, if it be set by his baptism.

For he, because he is cum from heaven, will teach heavenly things: I being
but an yearthly creature, But one stronger the^ I shall cum after me. etc
do speak yearthly things and low, matiers. I diepe your bodies in water,
but he shall diepe your souls, and baptize you with the holy ghost and with
fire. And look how much the spirit is of more strength to ^^tre and to perce,
then is water, look how much the fire is of more strength and effect then is
water, of so much more power shall his baptism be, then mine is: hitherto
has it been unknown, who were the true folowers of godlynes. An easy thing
it is to be washed with water, a light matter it is to kill a beast in
sacrifice: an easy point it is to forbear eating of swynes flesh. But now
does such doctrine cum to light, such times do approach even here at hand,
that they can no longer be unknown who be good folks in very deed, and who
be otherwise. For he will cum to do the thing that he has so oftentimes
thretened in the prophets, which is, by a precise straight judgment, to
disclose a perfect difference between ye godly and the wicked. For he will have
in his hand a fan, (for unto this man is given all power in heaven and on
earth,) and with his fan, which no man shall be able to avoid, he shall
make clean the floor of his winnowyng place, and there winno we every
creature, triyng them with the wind of the cross and affliccions.

And such persons as are but chafe, that is to say, in pretense of
holiness, merely gaye, but withinfoorth void and empty of all devotion,
shall fly about this way and that way, whyther soever carnal desire and
affeccion shall carry them: but such as are good wheat, having within the^
substaunciall and true godlynes, shall not be scattered abroad al about with
the wind: but when the chafe is tried a way, they shall declare the
substaunciall stedfastnes of their mind, which nothing could move. That
tempest shall not make any persons evil, but shall show them openly to be
known what they were, even when they were not seen: in like sort, as the
clear light where it is, does not make any persons blind or deformed, but
shows who be deformed or blind. The truth of the gospel is bright light,
which they shall not abide nor away withal, that did before show forth their
peynted sheathe under the counterfeit cloak of holiness, whereas before God they
were men of wickedness: and contrarywyse they shall be embraced and much made
of, which whereas unto the worldewarde they were reputed for abiectes, yet
nevertheless had a perfect zele of godly deuocio^ in their breasts. Such
persons as at the strong force of the doctrine of God, when they hear it,
shall be moved and stirred to doing of mischief, and to slaughter, shall not than
first of all be made wicked: but such occasion being given, it shall openly
appear what manner fellows they were before. For an occasion does not make folks
wicked, but does discover them and show them as they be. Such an one as
when the loss of goods is set before his iyes, or wha^ peril of any cross
or of death is showed him, will fall from the professynge of the truth, and
forsake it, shall not even than first of all begin to be wicked but he shall
at such a time plainly declare what manner an one he was before. Neither shall
every one byanby that is dipped in water, endure throughout in this examinacion
or trial: but such an one as has fully received into him the spirit of God,
and he that has thoroughly conceived the fire of charity and love
vnperishable: such an one shall not be moved with any storm of mysauentures
or evils, but shall rather be the more better pourged and the more ^tedfast,
in like sort as wheat and other grain is pourged and made clean with the
fanning of the wind, and as gold is scoured by the virtue of the fire. Leat
therefore every body prepare theimselfes to this rygorouse and precise trial,
trustyng not a whit to his nobleness of birth, putti^g none affiaunce in the
holiness of his auncestrie, nor putting no trust in the carnal ceremonies of
Moses law, but arming and fe^sing his solle with fortresses, and wards of
more piththie substance to trust to. It shall be no small point of the
matter, what sort every body be found to be of. Health everlasting, and
everlasting damnacion shall try out and divide the sound, from the light ones
that are but puffes, And the chafe shall he burn.
and the right borne Israelites from the bastardes. For the well cleansed corn
shall he lay up into the barn of the heavenly life, and the chafe shall he
burn up in fire that never shall be quenched. The judgment shall here in sum
piece be showed, but after this present life it is, that the wicked receive
the affliccion of endless pain and tormente. With these and many other
sayings mo, did John exhort the people to repe^tau^ce of their former life,
and to the desire of Messiah, which was than shortly to cum, now puttyng them
in fear of peril, now styrryng them to goodness with promise of rewards,
and (as ye would say) awakenyng the minds of the people unto the earneste zele
of evangelical godliness, with the gladsom news of redemption and salvation.

And this boldness of speaking so plainly, the common vulgar people, in
consideration of the notable holiness of the man, could abide very well: the
Publicanes could suffer it well enough: ye soldiers also took it in good part:
and al these wha^ they were reproved, did willingly acknowlage their disease,
and being brought in a fear, they sought for remedy. But Herod could in no
wise away withal, who with his haulte stomach (because he was a king) would
have all things to be lawful for him, that stood with his lust or fansy. Yet
did he bear very good favor and love to John. He very well saw and also did
no less allow the perfeccion of his life, being such as was in few men,
yea and in many things also would he be rewled by the counsel of John. But
yet in that point in which it had been chefely of all expedient and behoueable
to give ^are unto John's sayings, he did not only not do after his counsel,
but also cast him into prison for giving him good advertisement. And brought
John to destruction, when John was diligent to call him back from destruction.
Of this sort are oftentimes ye hertes of such Princes, as the wisdom of the
gospel has not throughlye won ne recouerrd from the dominion of abominable
lusts. Sum such me^ be lords and rulers over others, as on their own
behalfes are bo^dseruau^tes to their own violent and strong affeccions: and
such think themselfes even for this point specially to be Kings, that they
be slaves and bond men to abominacion, no man sayi^g black their iye. They
many times call unto their service to be about the^, men well approved and
known for their holiness of living, they have many times private communicacion
with the same, and after the counsel or advise of such they do many things:
not that they have delight in true godlynes, but that they may by such a cloak
purchase to themselves an opinion of perfect living, and that they may somewhat
mollifye means repining and grutching at their naughty doings: or to the
end, that when they piele and polle the people, wha^ they ^eise wicked
battle, wha^ they play tiranuous parts toward sum that bear good heart and
will to the common weal: they may seem to do these things too, by the
counsayl of most approved honest men. And even in the like sort did Herod
abuse ye pilche of Camels hyde, wherewith John was clad: in the like sort did
he abuse the leatherne belte wherewith John was girt, so did he abuse the spare
diet that John used: so did he the innocence of John's whole life: so likewise
did he the authority of John, through which he might do very much with the
people, and altogether to the maintenau^ce of his own tyranny. And for this
cause the Lord Jesus does afterward call him fox. For this is the wily
craftines of evil princes of this world: unto whom if it shall at any time
fortune right professors of the ghospel to be called to service, either ye
gospellers must eschew the coumpany and conversation of such masters, in
whose houses they shall sooner be marred and brought to naughtiness on their
own parties, then they shall turn the others to better ways, orels they must
prepare their minds aforehande to the like reward for showing the truth
without dissimulacion, that John fortuned to get for his labor. For when
Herod nothing growyng out of kind from the manners and facions of his father
and others his ancestors, played many wieked and tira^nous parts, pillyng
and pollyng the people, pulling away all liberty by oppression, punishyng in
others the same things in which he was a common offender himself, using all
offices of magistrates under him as sale ware for money, vsyng also to sell the
ministracions of priestehood, and kepi^g within his house openly in the face of
all the world, one Herodias, the wife of Phylyp being his brother, and had by
force of strong hand taken her away from his said brother yet being alive,
together with a daughter of the same Philippes: this holy man because he could
not abide such incest and unnaturalness of marriage in a kings house, from
whens especially above al other places, it was convenient that example of
keeping the laws should proceed, advertised him to refrain himself from such a
wicked misdede. But with a deiulish king, the deiulishe request of a gierle
being a minion dauncer together with the suggestion of a deiulish woman,
weighed more, then the wholesome advertisement of so vncorrupt a man: with the
which good aduertiseme^t he was nothing the better, but remained still so far
out of the way from being amended, that unto his heinous enormities before past,
he added one deed of myschief more, the most ungracious that ever was: that is
to wete, casting John into prison, and procedyng so far at last in
outrageous woodnes, that he caused the head of the most innocent man to be
chopped of, and so gave it to the wenche for a reward of her vicious wanton
dauncyng.

But now, (to return to the discourse of the story) before that the lord
Jesus would enter into the buisie office of preaching, which he intended with
in the coumpasse of a short time to acco^plishe, and bring to a perfect end,
to the intent that he would leave no one point of humility or of righteousness
unfulfilled: thought no disdain to cum with the residue of folks unto
baptism, not to be purified himself, (which he neded not) but to consecrate
and halow the lauacre or fount of eternal salvation to our behofe through his
baptism. He humbled himself, but that notwithstanding, he was as well by the
voice of John, as also by the most clear testimony of his eternal father,
openly commended in the face of all the people, to the intent that they might
know him eue^ by the face to and by sight, of who^ the prophets had
aforetymes spoken much by prophecy, and of who^ John had openly witnessed. So
than, at that time a great number of the common people were in baptising, and in
the same cumpany Jesus Christ cu^ming as one among the mo, had instantly
desired of John to have baptism, as though he had been like other me^ subject
to sin: John would have refused to baptize him, acknowlagyng him as ye autour
and geuer of purity, of whom he ought rather to had been baptized himself. And
thissame testimony was given first of John to the dignity of Jesus being there
personally in place, eue^ before all the multitude of the people: but the
heavenly father did by a more evident mark, disseuer his son Jesus from ye
residue of ye cu^pany that were baptized. For unto all the rest, wha^ they were
in baptising, there appeared no sign ne token at al. But immediately after that
ye lord Jesus was baptized, as he was now making^g his devout prayers to god
(teaching us thereby, that when the state of innocence is perfitely renewed
through baptism, we ought immediately to convert and bestow our selves to such
studies and exercises as are of the spirit, among which, devout prayer has the
first place) heaven opened, which his baptism set wide open to us, where as
until that day it had been shut up from us. And from thens came down ye holy
ghost, b^ing of himself in deed invisible, but for that time enuested and clad
with a figure or likeness visible, because he should be seen with the iyes of
men. And as for the likeness, it was of a dove, because that this bird, being
as a sign to represent innocence, or simplicity, had many hundred years
before brought a branch of an olive tree into the ark of Noah, for a toke^
that the wrath of God was pacified, and also a caucion or pledge of warra^tise
that the floudde was at an end. And in deed the said floudde of Noe, by which
ye world was at that time scoured and pourged of all naughty creatures, did
contain a mystical figure of our baptism, whereby all our sins are drowned
up, our bodies and souls both, being preserved in perfyte safety. In this
likeness than did the holy ghost descend down, Upon him*
and rest upon the holy top of the lord Jesus head, openly betokenyng that
he it was, whom God the father had plenteously anointed with all heavenly
gifts of grace, which gifts he would afterward pour out upon al persons,
as many as by puttyng their affiaunce and trust in him, And a voice came from
heaven.
were or should afterward be graffed in the brotherhoode of his body thoroughe
baptism. There came also unto him besides this likeness of a dove, an evident
testimony of his fathers voice, not now declared by ye prophets, not by
Moses, not by angels, but publyshed by the father self, not that the^ father
may in his very own likeness as he is, be either heard, or seen, or by any
sense of the body comprehended or perceived: but like as the holy ghost being
invisible did openly show himself to the iyes of men in a visible sign, even
so the heavenly father sending down a voice through ye elements above, did
se^sibly pearce ye ears of me^. And the voice that souned from on high, was in
these words. Thou art mine own only dear beloved son in whom I am
thoroughly pleased and satis^ied. To none of all the holy me^ that ever were in
old time, was there ever any testimonye of such like sort as this given. A
dove cumming before, pointed out certainly, Thou art my beloved son, in the
do I delight.
to whom this voice did apperteine, to thentent that no man should deem it to
be John, that was commended with the said poysee, of the which John, a great
many of folks had conceived such an high estimacion, that they verilye
thought him to be the Messiah self. By so many testimonies was it the pleasure
of Christ to be commended unto ye world, ere he would address him to enter
the high charge of preaching: geuyng in the mean time a lesson to us by
exaumple of himself, that no man should press or toumble himself into such
an high office so dainlye or irreverently, ere he made himself mete for it. He
had privately had testimonye given him of Angels, of Elizabeth, of Simeo^, of
Anna, of the Magians: and in the open face of the world by John, (whose
authority was of right great wayghte and force among the Jews,) and by the
holy ghost, and by the fathers own self.

Helmadam, which was the son of Her, which was the son of Ieso, which was
the son of Helyezer, which was the son of Ioram, which was the son of
Mattha, which was the son of Leui, which was the son of Simeon, which

was also annexed the authority of full years, And Jesus himself began to be of
thirty years of age.
fit for such a purpose. For at the time when the lord Jesus came unto
baptism, he was well toward the point of thirty years of age: not that ye
age is esteemed before God, but because it was convenient, that he which should
draw all persons unto him, should satisfy all creatures in all behalfes:
neither in such a person any one point to be, which any creature might
any thing lykelye deprave or find fault withal. The age therefore of due
rypenesse was chosen thereunto and tarried for, until it came: because that
over young age (when one is but a striplyng toward a young man) is not of any
authority or regard among men: for the general opinion of people is, that
such an one is inexpert and unskillful: and on the other side, old age is the
lighter esteemed and passed on, by reason that the power and habylitie of the
wit, is much decayed, and such ones greatly suspected of dotyng. So that he
was supposed to be the son of Joseph.
And for because that the bleamyshe of ones lineage does soore abate a great
piece of his authority among the common people, this point also was provided
for, that Jesus should for so long time be verylye thought and believed to be
the soonne of Joseph, until the gospel were thoroughe his miracles and
preaching, sufficiently brought to light and made famous. This was a thing for
the dignity of Christ, to be borne of a vyrgyn: but because it was not much
material that the same should even at the first day cum to light and
knoweledge abroad, and yet though it had, it would have been a very hard
matter to be persuaded to the world: he used the wrong opinion of the people
an other way to a good purpose, because no manner thing should in the mean
time diminyshe his authority in his preaching, if he might of any manner
lykelyhood have been said to be borne in aduoutrye. It was his pleasure to
cum into the world borne out of a simple mean house: but yet such an house,
as no spotte of ill name or fame had at any time stained.

For verily to a teacher of the ghospel, not only the fault self, but also al
likeness and appearance of the fault must be avoided, and a teacher ought of
duty not only to be a man of good co^mendacio^ for ye virtuous qualities that
he has but also without any infeccion or spark of such things, of which the
people uses to conceive any mistrust of evil. For this is the common opinion
of most men, that scarcely at any time there does of evil parents cum good
children. Therefore Christ, who shunned not the reproach of poverty, who
shronke not to be borne out of a mean house: yet eschewed ye simple reprofe
and slander that might have cum of his age and of his descent. And although
Joseph was not the father of Jesus by nature, but by thorder of ye law only,
(because he was the spoused housbande of Jesus mother:) yet nevertheless
because he married a wife of the same tribe and house that himself was of, I
have thought it best to begin the reckenyng of our lords petygrewe, at him,
to the end that it may the more evidently appear, that a very manne he was in
deed, on the bodies behalf naturally borne of them, of whom the foresaiynges
of the prophets had before his cummyng told that borne he should be. For
after the higher nature of his godhed, the heavenly fathers self acknowlaged
and openly protested Jesus to be his own very soonne. Than Joseph the spouse
of the virgin Marie (who was mother to Jesus,) was after the form of the law,
Which was the son of Heli.
called the son of Heli, being his uncle by the fathers side, but after the
truth of natural generation, he was the son of Jacob, which Jacob reised
sede unto his brother Heli, being borne out of yesame bealy that himself was,
because the same Heli was deceassed with out issue, and so upon his wife, who^
he at his diyng left a widow, Jacob, beegot a son called Joseph, Heli was the
son of Mathat, and he again had Leui to his father. Leui was borne of Melchi,
who was begotten of Ianna the son of Joseph son of Matatthias, to who^ Amos
was father. And him did Nau^ beget, who was the son of Helsi, and Helsi borne
of his father Nagge, and Nagge issued out of Maath, the son of Matathias.
This Matathias was cum of the seed of Semei, the son of Joseph, who was
begotten and borne of Judah. Judah had to his father Ioanna, the soonne of Rhesi,
being son to zorobabel, zorobabels father was zalathiel, borne his self of
Neri, the son of Melchi, who was descended of the lineage of Addi the son of
Cosam, begotten of Helmada^. And he was lineallye descended of Her, the son
of Ieso, who was borne of Heleazer the soonne of Ioram. And father to Ioram was
Mattha, being himself borne of Leui the son of Simeon, borne of Judah the
son of Joseph. And him had Iona^ begotten being himself the son of
Heliachim, the son of Melea^. And he was borne of Mathatha, being the son
of Nathan.

This man had king David begotten of Barsabee, by whom was restored the stock
of Solomon, which failed before, and decayed in Ozochias. David was begotten of
Iesse the son of Obed, being borne of Booz. Father to this man was Salmo^,
the son of Naasson, being borne of Aminadab, to whom Aram was father, and
Aram son to Esrom, begotten of phares the son of Judah, Judah came by lineall
discente from the Patriarch Jacob the son of Isaac, whom Abraham being an
aged man had according to Gods promise, begotten of his old wife Sara. And
Abraham was borne of Tharra the son of Nachor, being begotten of Saruch the
son of Ragau, to whom Phalec was father, and father to him again was Heber,
begotten of Sale, the son of Cainan, and Cainan the son of Arphaxat, whose
father was Sem, the son of Noe, and Noe, the son of Lamech, and he the
son of Mathusalah, being born of Enoch, whose father was Iareth, and he
descended of Malalehel, the son of Cainan, who was begotten of Enoch the
son of Seth, whose father was Adam, and begotte Seth after that he had lived
an hundred and thirty years. Adam was the head of al mankind having none other
autour ne progenitour of his generation but only God, of whom he was created
of the claie of the earth, being to him (as it were) instead of a mother. And
for because that all mankind was infected and tayn^ted through the sin of
this our yearthly father, and resembling the inclynacion of the same first
father, it was now fallen into all kind of viciousness: there was sent the
lord Jesus as a restorer and a redemer of the same mankind when it was so
extremely fallen, to the end that the same which had full and whole fallen down
through ye disobedience of one, might be reconciled again through the obedience
of one: and to the end that like as all those which had followed the steps of
their earthly father, became thereby subject unto death: so they which being
exempted from the kynred of the sinner thorough baptism, were graffed into the
heavenly Adam (which is Jesus Christ,) and did cleue fast unto the steps of
the same: should attain everlasting life in heaven. And in deed the
begynnynges of mankind when it fell, and of the same, at the restorynge of it,
do in many behalfes answer taunt pour taunt, the one contrary to the other.
For nothing at all was there done in this matier by blind chance or
casualtie: but all the whole process and discourse of things was tempered and
ordered by the wisdom and ordinance of God almighty. The talkyng of Eve with
the serpent when she was a virgin, was the beginning of our deadly perishyng:
and the talkyng of the virgin Marie with Gabriell, was the beginning of our
health and recovery. Eve being corrupt with the lure of an apple laughyng
on her, both cast away her housbande, and also brought in death into the
world: and Marie being a virgin for ever and ever uncorrupted, constauntly
despysynge all alluremente of the flesh, and with simple plain faith
willingly yeldyng her self unto the will of god, brought forth the man that
brought health and salvation to the world. Adam also was tempted, and
ouercomed: Christ being tempted, overcame the temptour. Adam following the
mind of his wife when she was corrupted, was cast out of paradise for his
labor: Christ obeiyng his father even unto death, set the way into heaven
wide open. For the sensual pleasure of tasting an apple, was Adam made a bond
servant unto the devil: Christ by setting all the kingdoms and delycate
pleasures of ye world at naught, delivered our enemy into our hands, to be
subdued at our own pleasure. The one thoroughe the eating of an apple, lost
al his posterity and succession: and the other through abstinence of meat
restored them that before were lost. The one was driven away out of Paradise
into the earth, replenished with misery, and liyng al desert: and ye other
has made a way unto heaven safe and strongly fensed from al desertnesse. Ada^
through ye vain desire of proud knowelage, plucked his succession after him
unto death, and Christ through the humble obedience of faith, did restore life
again. Yea, and besides all this, on both parties wood and tree. On the one
side the serpent by mean of the tree, overcame and beguiled Adam: and on the
other side Christ by mean of the tree, beguiled and also overcame ye devil.
By mean of the tree came death: by mean of the tree came life. The head and
chief captain of our destruction was made out of the earth, being a virgin:
and the head of our salvation, borne of the virgin Marie. Adam was created to
the likeness of God, and Christ being the true likeness of God, took on
him both the likeness and nature of man. Adam was deceived through his wife
Eve: and Christ has called back his spouse the church, from the
deceiptefull error of the devil. On the one party, a woman, while she seeks
to be made wise, vttred furthe the beginning of all foolyshenesse: and on the
other party, a woman, while she shows herself void of al such
presumpcion, brings forth unto us the fountain of wisdom. The first Adam
while he has more desire to be wise then obedient, brought in folishenesse
into the world: and the new Adam whereas he was the wisdom of his father, was
content to be made as a fool for our sakes, to the end that we might be made
wise in him. Through pride came our fall: and through humility came our
setting up again. Adam being through the serpent made bare of all the good
qualities of the mind, covered himself with leaves plucked from the tree:
Christ being rich in gifts celestial, desired no manner thing at all of this
worlds. The figures also of the old Testament do very well accord with the
story of the gospel. Moses guided and led the Israelites out of Egypt: and
Christ has delivered them from the derkenesse of ignorance, and from the
bondage of vice. They had their passage there through the water, and we here
through baptism have a ready way to salvation and freedom. There was a
pilour of a cloud and of fire: and here the father sends a voice down
through a cloud, and our spirit is baptized with fire. Through the first law
is occasion of death: through the law of the gospel we are called again to
life. But the old law did with throundreynges and lyghtenynges make them sore
afeard: and the law of the gospel does with ientilnesse and benefits call
us forth to salvation. Moses was terrible to be seen, but in such wise that
constreyned he was to cover his face: Christ is mylde and full of courteous
humanity, and puttyng himself in company among the thickeste of the people.
Moses went up to the hill to talk with God: and Christ came down to us, to
the intent that God should speak to us by him. The first Adam while he
coueteth to be equal with God, is compared to brute beasts, void of
understanding. The second Adam when he humbled himself from his godly
majesty down to the bassenesse of our human nature, whereas we were more
abiecte and vile then even the brute beasts are, helyf^ed us up to the
participacion and brotherhood of his godhed. Now to conclude, through Jesus
the son of Naue was their returnyng into the land flowyng with milk and
honey: and through Jesus the son of a virgin is our returnyng again into
paradyse. Let us therefore go away from the disposicion of our first parents,
and duly following the life of our Lord Jesus, let us with pure minds enbrace
his benefit and let us with all godly zele and endeavor follow his exaumple to
the best of our powers: himself will aid us thereto with his help, the which
of his goodness has given the example: let us enbrace the merciable and
vnwrathfull maker of the law evangelical. Let us follow our guide, who only
and none but he, is hable to bring all nations of the whole world home unto
that same land, which continually without end does most plenteously flow
with all kind of joys.

The.iiii. Chapter.

ANd Jesus (upon whose head the dove had lighted before at his baptism, being
not a void sign, but the holy ghost himself in that likeness,) although he
were now full of the holy ghost, yet before he would enterprise the office of
preaching the gospel: because he would be in all things approved and tried
even to the vttermoste, ere he would take such an office in hand: Returned
from Jordan.
he departed from Jordan, geuyng thereby a lesson, that after baptism, men
should endeavor themselfes to the more higher exercises of godly living: he
withdrewe himself from the coumpanie of people, with whom to be familiar and
much conuersaunte, does many times corrupt a man, and also does cause the
authority of a teacher to be the less esteemed and regarded. And was led by
the spirit into wilderness.
And by the spirit of God, wherewith he was wholly ravished and possessed, he
was moved and led furthe into wilderness, from whence John had to fore come
furthe among the people. And this did Jesus even as one that minded to bid
the enemy of mankind, quickly to come of and make ready all his crafts and
ingiens: verayly of purpose, both to show and declare unto us that the devil,
who had hitherto been as a conqueror over mankind, and had holden them
captive, may be vanquyshed and subdued: and also as it were, with his finger
to point unto us the way how to win the victory over him. A place was
sought and found apt and mete for the temptours purpose, and that was
wilderness: and occasion was ministered by the means of hounger. For Jesus to
do the part that Moses did in this behalf, And in those days did he eat
nothing.
now that he went about to give unto the world a new law, that is to were,
a doctrine of grace, which is the gospel, he fasted as Moses had done,
fowertie days: and in all this time of the said fowertie days, he touched no
manner of meat, but passed over all this time with holy prayers, unto God:
geuyng laud and glory to the same, and with geuyng continual thanks unto his
heavenly father. And this was a pattern and a saumple or president of a
certain rare and vnwoonte virtue in manne. Neither was he ignorant of the
crafts and subtilties of Satan, who by all means possible never more
earnestely pitcheth and sets his snares and grinnes, then when he perceyueth
the mind and soul of man with notable endeavor to incline and draw toward
heavenly living. And Satan had heard that one there should come, which
should discoumfeight and destruie his puissaunce: and whether that mighty
conqueror were now already come or no, he stood in doubt: and what manne
Jesus should be, he could not tell. For Satan who had beguiled mankind to fore
by his subtle crafts and wyles, was now contrarywyse to be beguiled by the
politic wisdom of God. He had heard John openly confess and say, I am not
Christ. Wherefore seeing and perceyuyng many things in Christ, which far
surmounted the compace of man's power: and on the other side again, seeing him
to be an houngred, and to be in great affliccion through defaulte of taking
bodily susteinaunce, (whereas it is not read that Moses and Helias after the
fasting and absteinyng from meat by the space of like noumbre of days were an
hungered:) he supposed Jesus to be nothing else but a man, yea and such a man, as by his crafty conueighaunce might be corrupted. Now the wily and
subtle deuyse of the temptour was this: that is to wete, either to overcome
and win him in deed, or at the least wise to hunte out, whether he were that
Son of God or no, which had been promised by the Prophets. Which thing if
he might have perceived so to be, than would he bend all his strength and
force to this end and purpose, that by one way or other he might hindre and
let the redemption of mankind.

But no craft is hable to take place or effect against the wisdom of God,
which in such sort tempered and ordered all her doings, that it did not
only subdue and conquier that same our most subtle and crafty enemy, but
also defeacted him of his purpose by his words, leauyng him in as much
doubt and uncertainty, as he was before. By the infirmity of the fleashe he
mocked and disapoynted him of his purpose, and through the stoutnesse and
puissaunce of the spirit, together with the sure fence of holy scripture, he
vanquished and subdued him, so that having the foil and overthrow to his
great shame, he was drieuen away, and departed in as much uncertainty,
whether this were the son of God or no, as he was before at his first
cummyng. Satan therefore laid against Jesus that same effectual darte and
artillery, And when they were ended he afterward houngred.
that he first used against the first parents of mankind, Adam and Eve: and
therewith ouerthrewe them, albeit he only enticed them with the lure of a
fair apple that laughed upon them: but here in Jesus case, houngre also, being
an evil that no man can endure withal, was a strong helper forward to the
thing, Genesis xxv.v
that the temptour went about. Esau, bieyng compelled with hounger, sold the
title and interest of his birtheright that he should have had by eldership, he
sold it for a mess of pottage. And the Lord Jesus (if it had been his
pleasure) might through his divine power, either have kept away hounger from
cummyng to him, or else have drieuen it away when it was come. Nevertheless he
would not so do, but it was his full pleasure and will to lay a bait for the
temptour to use, wherewith the same te^ptour should be taken his own self. The
weakness of his body being such as other men had, was laid in Satan's
way, as a secret bait to use for his purpose: but the temptour stumbled, and
hit on the hook of the power of his godhead. He saw the body of a man
witheryng and drying clean away with hounger, to be in great affliccion and
pain, and none other like but shortly to be in the ieopardie and peril of
death. (And men plainly affirm that there is no kind of death more peinfull,
then to be famyshed to death.) He saw him in the wilderness far from any
town or village, from whence any meat might be gotten or ministered unto him
for his susteinaunce. Taking therefore a boldness of these things the spirit
of wickedness assaileth the Lord Jesus being replete with the spirit of
holiness: he bids bace, and begins first with him, of whom he was to be
subdued: he bids him come forth, who was so strong and valiaunte for him to
match withal: he attempteth to take in the snare, If thou be the son of
God, commau^de this stone, that it be bread.
one far wyser and more wary than himself. What nedest thou (says Satan)
to be thus tormented with houngre? If thou be that same son of God which
was promised to be sent to redeem the world, command that this stone turn
into bread for thy behoufe, and that will be an euidente token where by for
the to declare, that thou art the son of God in deed. For thy father
undoubtedly will not in this behalf give a deaf ear to his son, being thus
in distress and ieoperdie of death through houngre. And seeing that he created
all things of naught, It is written: Man shall not live by bread only but by
every word of God.
it should be an act of no great matter, if the Son of God turn a stone
into bread. But Jesus being not ignoraunte what the temptour herein hunted
for, so tempered his answer, that he neither consented to the temptours
counsel, nor yet disclosed the nature of his godhead to his enemy, who now
by a new and a strange conueighaunce, was through the infirmity, and
weakness of Jesus body, both to be beguiled, and also to be conquered. He
denies not but the Son of God had power to turn stones into bread, ne
disalloweth to assuage the houngre of the body with meat which was ordained
therefore, but by the authority of the holy scripture of God, he plainly
shows, that there is a life of the soul much more to be regarded then the
life of the body: and that there is a spiritual meat, which is more
requisite to be desired, then the meat that for a short time prolongeth the
bodily life, which life nevertheless must of necessity perish within a
short space afterward, either by means of sickness, or of age, or of some
other casualtie. For the meat of the spirit gives life for ever to endure,
and this meat is the word of God. This first assault therefore of the
devil, Jesus avoided with this answer: It is written (says he in the book
of deuteronomie. Deuteronomy. vii. a Man lives not by bread only, but by every word that proceeds out of
the mouth of God.

And for this purpose does the Lord now take the word of the divine
scriptures for his staigh: first to teach us humility and sobrenesse, that we
ought not precisely to affirm any thing without the authority of Scripture
given unto us from God: Secondly he declares unto us, that there is no weapon
of more effectual strength against all the instinctes and mocions of wicked
devils, then the authority of the holy Scriptures. Out of the said Scriptures,
is the true meat of the soul to be sought and gotten, if a man be of mind
and will to live to god ward, to whom ward whosoever lives not, the same is
already but a deadman, yea although to the iye he appear to be alive. The
first parents Adam and Eve did eat, and they died for their labor. That if
they had given the temptour that same answer, which the Lord Jesus here at
this present time gave him, and had more regarded the Lords commandment
(the due keeping whereof gives life everlasting,) then the appetite and lust of
that mortal apple: they had not endaungered both themselves and all their
succession after them to death and damnacion. And thus much ferther does the
exaumple of our salueour teach, that miracles are not to be showed for the
lust or pleasure of men, but at such times only, when the glory of Christ
does call for it, or else charity and love toward our brother, does
necessarily require it. For either to work or to feign sightes of woondres
for a vainglorious boastyng, (as who should say, this can I do:) or to
satisfy the curious lust and pleasure of the lookers on, whereby neither
gods glory is advanced, nor any profit grows unto our neighbor, is
nothing else but the property and condition of witches and Iuglers: as for
ensaumple, a brennyng fire brande to be diepped into the water, and not
quenched therewith: or the fearful likeness of Hector or Achilles to be made
appear to the sight: or the rushes and strawes to go crallyng about the
house, seemyng to be snakes. Jesus at no time showed any miracle, but that
both the glory of his father was set furthe thereby, and also the necessity
of men relieved, or else that for a time the unbelief of men should
thereby be moved and stiered to feith. When the multitude of the people wanted
wherewith to be fed, he so multiplied a few loaves, that the same suffised
to many thousands: but in somuche would he not vouchesalue to feed the iyes
of Herod with any miracle, that he would not so much as open his lips to
speak unto him. And for the like purpose and consideracion, does he at this
present deny a miracle to Satan.

The dieuill, though he were vanquished at this first bickeryng, yet ceased
not from trying maisteries with Jesus to our exaumple, lest that we being
once conquerours, should give our selfs to sittyng still, void of all fear
or care: but that we should have evermore from time to time, a mind ready and
well armed and fensed against his new assaults. Such as have profited and
grown to a mean degree of evangelical philosophy and doctrine, do easily
contemn the disease or vice of gluttony and riottous excess, as a thing
being both filthye and beastely.

Albeit even in this temptacion also before godyng, there wanted not the grynne
and snare of mouyng Jesus to presumpteouse vsurpyng and taking upon him, when
Satan said: If thou see the Son of God. For such as of nature are
arrogaunte and proud, and desirous of glory, do often times attempt to
reach to such things as are far above their powers: because they will not
lose any part of the opinion and estimacion that men have of them: and so by
crafty couloure and counterfaite gloss, they take unto them the thing that is
not in them, huntyng for glory and fame among men. After that sort do many
by deceiptefull and crafty feasts usurp unto themselfes the gift of
prophecy, which they have not: and many make vauntes and crakes of having
visions of Aungelles, which they yet never saw. But the Lord Jesus contrary
wise: although he were greattest of all the world, yet he will not be acknowen
of his greatness, but hydeth it, showing forth ward no countenance but of
infirmity and weakness of the body, ne at any time shows he forth his
godly power, but when so to do is expediente for the health of man, to the
end that the fathers glory may be renoumed and troumped abroad by the son.
Satan therefore (as he is malicious, and will never have dooen ne be in rest,)
does eftesones invade the Lord, and set upon him with the same darte that
he had dooen before, but in a soondrie matter, assaying whether he that could
not be overthrown with hounger, might possibly be corruptted with the
richesse and honors of this world. For ambicion (which is the desire of
honor and aduauncemente) is a soore mischief both pestilente and also in
manner impossible to be ouercomed. It is an eiuyll that steals on a man
even in most excellent virtues and qualities, crepyng in and acquaintyng it
self in hertes that labor to clyme and to mount up unto things of high
difficulty: in so much, that whom neither adversity, nor poverty, ne
sickness have been hable to break, whom neither any riottous excess, or
leacherie, has been hable to corrupt, them does the earneste desire and
affeccion of glory, overthrow and bring quyte under foot. For what thing is
there so mischeuous or so wicked, which mortal men will refuse both to do
and suffer, if they may thereby bear rewle, and be in authority? Is not
oftetymes the croune of a royalme bought with poysonynges, with murdreing of
the nerest kynred, with incestuous marriage within the degrees forbidden by
gods law, and with other vilanies not to be named? With the slaughter and
murdremente of how many persons, is the seigniourie of some one city now
and than gotten into men's hands and possession? Honor is sweet: a gaye
thing it is to be a rewler: and a royal matter to excel and pass others.

And reignyng does utterly in all behalfes, seem to be a certain point of
Godhed among men. With this same sweet flatteryng poison were the first
parents Adam and Eve caught. The lure of the flatteryng apple was delectable
to their iyes: but the high perfeccion of knowlage falsely promised unto them
by the Serpente, and the dignity of being equal with the state of Gods,
was much more delectable to their minds. And the deiuill took him into an
high mountain etc.
With this engein therefore did the temptoure assail Jesus, and he not a
whitte shrounke back from the vnrestefull malepertnesse of the same temptoure:
to the end that he would vanquishe him to our behoufe, and would teach us
the facion how to get the ouerhande of him. The dieuyll than took Jesus
up into an high mountain, and out of the same mountain as out of a beakon or
an high place of spyall, he sodaynlye in a momente lays all the kingdoms of
the world before his iyes (for a wicked spirit by the permission and
sufferaunce of God may so much do, as to represente unto men's iyes a
lively semblaunte of things, after a certain strange and woondrefull manner:)
and even in the same momente also, look whatsoever point of high estate or
royalty, the route and ruffleyng of great kings and princes has within their
courts, or otherwise belongyng unto them: the same does Satan by a certain
slight, as it were of a iugleyng cast, set before the iyes of Jesus (as for
exaumple,) richesse, servants, palayces, armies, troumpettes, service and
attendaunce of men, crouchyng and knelyng unto them, shows of royaltye when
they go abroad, tryoumphes, ambassades, power to command and to have all
things dooen at a beck, and other things a great maygnye, wherewithal the
flaterye of all peoples, dooethe wurshippe and exalte mortal princes of the
world, being oftetymes both foolish and ungodly, or howesoeuer other things
be, ywisse frayll, and not having any long time to live: yet the people use
them as veraye Gods: yea and the princes selves being set in a pride
through the prosperouse fortune of things transytorye, think themselves
better then God almyghties fellows. A certain spectacle of all these things
woonderful to behold and imagine, did that same crafty iugler soodainly in a
moment represente before the iyes of the Lord Jesus, who cannot be deceived
with any sleyghtes of iugleyng, forasmuch as nothing is hydden or unknown
unto him. And unto this royal show of things, did the lying and malaperte
Satan set out a paincted sort of words more stately and glorious, then the
things selves were. All this power will I give the. etc.
All these same things (says he so goodlye, so rich, and so full of
royalty, be delivered to my power and dysposicion, to give and to grant
unto whomesoeuer me lyketh. For the soueraygne and the God of this world, I
am. That if thou will acknowlage my soueraygne godly power, and fallying
down flat at my knees will bow and kneel unto me, If thou will fall
down before me. etc.
the whole universal power and possessyon of all these realms and kingdoms
that thou seeste, will I deliver up into thy hands. Thou seeste how great
the name of Ceasar is euerywhere: and yet how small a porcyon of the world is
it, that acknowelageth him for their Lord and soueraygne? And thou alone
shalt have and enjoy them every one without excepcyon, and shalt be
wurshypped as a God here on yerthe, so that thou will acknowlage me for the
autour and geuer of so great a blysfulnesse. Thou knoweste here (I am sure)
good christen reader, the most liyng and most presumptuouse sayings of him,
who said once unto those unfortunate first parents of mankind, Adam and
Eve: ye shall in no wise dye: but ye shall be as Gods, knowing good and
eiuyll. Here the Lord Jesus damned the wicked words of Satan, with words
of Gods holy Scripture, saying: Iuaunte Satan with all thy deceyptfull
promyses. An hurtful gain it is, and full of hyndreaunce, that is boughte
with the loss of due love and devotion toward GOD. The thing that thou
wouldeste couenaunce and endente to have, is wicked, and the thing that thou
promyseste is in vain. For written it is in the book of Deuteronomie: Deu.
vi, c. x d.
The Lord thy God shalt thou wurshippe, Thy Lord God shalt thou wurship.
etc.
and him only shalt thou serve. God will not suffer his glory to be put
over from himself to an other: nor will not suffer to have any partener in
it. He is the true God and Lord of all things whatsoever there is in heaven
or in yearthe. And unto all that are true wurshippers of him, he freely
promyseth the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven. His saying must men be
rewled by, rather then by thine: who like as thou dooeste wickedly require to
have to thy self, the honor that is due to God alone: so doeste thou promise
not only things of vanytye, and things that shall not any long time endure,
but also perteyning to an other man's possession, and not to thine.

The Lord Jesus might have answered: wherefore doooeste thou promise me that
is mine own already? With what face dooeste thou require me to fall down at
thy knees, sense that I am God the which crea^ed thee, the which expulsed
thee for thy pride, and cast thee down out of heaven, and ready and hable
even now to cast thee down into hell as soon as I shall so think good?
Over these veraye kingdoms which thou offerest me, no power ne title it is
that thou haste, if the wrong judgment and ungodliness of the mortal people
did not give thee power and authority over them. By their folly it is, that
thou art of any power. True love and devotion toward GOD, shall reuyue
again: and where shall thy kingdom than be? Thus might Jesus have said:
but Satan was at that present to be beguiled, and not to be enstructed, ne
taught. Neither was he worthy to be told of his fault, forasmuch as he
could by no manier means be reformed. But for our behoufe was all this
pageaunte played: we it were to whom this lesson was given, that whatsoever
thing has the dyshonoure of God joined with it, how profitable soever it seem
to be, is with great stoutness to be refused and defied: not as though
richesse are of themselves ^yuyll: or that to be a king is of it self eyuyll:
or to be a publyque magistrate or in high autorytie is of it self eiuyll:
but for that in manyer no man makes himself a way to these things, but by
naughtye means and conueyghaunce: and for that the things are not enjoyed ne
possessed without sore daungyer of forgettyng the bounden duty and love
toward God: and because they are subject to the hasarde of ieoperdyes and
perils innumerable. And truly whatsoever person being corrupted with
inordynate desire of such things as these, does make light of Gods
commandments, uses fraud and falsehoode, steals, forsweareth, sleagheth,
uses right and wrong as all one, such an one has even now already kneeled
down and dooen wurship to the prince of this world, and has denied God, by a
league made with Gods aduersarye. And as often as the mind of a Christen
manne is enticed, that for encreasyng of his substance, or for obteynyng rewle
and autorytie, or for purchasyng of glory and renoume, the truth may be
forsaken, and wickedness received in the place thereof: let him by this
exaumple of Christ his Capytayne, make answer without fear. Auaunte Satan
with all thy deceyptfull promises: only GOD is to be wurshypped and boughed
unto: and whosoever has him his good Lord, the same is Lord of all things with
him.

Jesus answered and said unto him: It is said: thou shalt not tempte the
Lord thy God. And as soon as all the temp^acyon was ended, the d^iuyll
departed from him for a season. Neither does the endless malapertenesse of
Satan, although it were thus also put of from his purpose, not yet neither give
over, or succeasse from temptyng. He sets upon Jesus once more, as an enemy
often to be vanquished: to the end that we should understand our selves to
have in this life a contynuall fight with the same our adversary, neither
any thing to be so much against all Gods for bode, whereunto he dares not
presume to provoke and entyce the true servants of God: but yet that good
men need not to fear, to whose behoufe Christ Jesus has vanquished him,
and who have darts and weapons enough, of most strength and virtue out of the
holy scriptures, wherewith the malaperte importunity of the temptour may in a
momente be out faced and quaylled. For all the advantage that he gets by
tempting is to none other point, but by ministering such a good occasyon, to
make the virtue of the good men greatter and better tried. He therefore leads
a way the Lord Jesus from the high mountain unto the city of Jerusalem,
and there set him even upon the vppermoste pynnacle of the temple, and
eftesons provoke him by temptacion, to the end that either being ouercomed
with vain glory he should cast himself down headlong and so break his
neck, or else by that token he should descrie himself to be the son of
God. And a defense to maynteyne his fraud withal, he stole out of the wholly
scripture, albeit understood and taken in a wrong sense, and not applied to
such a purpose as it ought to be. He shall give his Angels charge ou^e thee.
etc.
For by such like means do the wieked persons and heritiques many times
abuse the scripture of God, and deceive the unwary, when they deprave and
turn by a wrong sense, the rule of gods word to their own affeccyons.
Here (says he) declare thou, whether thou be the son of God, or not. Cast
thy self down headlong, and in case thou shalt have no harm at all thereby,
it may than be open and evident unto all creatures, that thou art the son
of God. Neither is there any daungier of any misadue^ture to befall thee. Psalm.
xxi.c.
For it is written in the psalms, as touching the son of God, that he shall
give charge to his angels concerning thee, that they see thee preserved, and
that they shall with their hands bear th^e up, that thou mayeste not stumble
with thy foot at any stone.

This prophecy was not showed directly of Christ alone, but of any godly
manne whateuer he be, that trusting boldelye on Gods mighty help, ought
not to be a fearde on his own behalf from any eiuilles of this world,
according as the Lord Jesus him self bid his Apostles to be out of all
fear or care in their hearts, for not so much as an hear of one of their
heads should peryshe, contrary to the mind and pleasure of their heavenly
father. But Jesus making no countenance all this while, that he was naturally
the son of God: only made this answer following, which might have been
made of any good man whateuer he had been: and with a text of holy scripture
rightly alleged, he conuynced the text of Scripture which Satan had falsely
cyted, as if one should have dryeue^out one nail with an other in a bourde.
But contrariwise (says he) it is written in the book of Deute^onomie: Thou
shalt not tempte the Lord thy God. Thou shall not tempte the Lord thy God.
His help shall be ready, when any casualtye or when any mattier concerning
Gods cause, shall bring them into daungier: but not when thou shalt for a
vayneglorye or a b^agge provoke and require the high power of God to be
showed. Neither does the tendrenesse of god toward us, serve to maintain
the glory of the carnal pleasure of man: but he at such times as his will
is, declaring his own glory in man, does succor man being destitute of the
aid and help of the world. But unworthy is that person of gods help, who
for his own vayneglorye does wilfully cast himself into a manifest
daungyer of his life. Neither is it the propertye of a true godly man to
appoyn^te unto God, when or how he ought to deliver us from perils, for
as much as certain we are, that whether he deliver us, or deliver us not, that
thing is entendyd and wrought by him, that is most for our health and
safegarde. Oftentimes it is more for our benefyte, and good hap to be
sick, then to be in health: to dye, then to live: to be in affliccion, then
to have prosperity. It is present godliness to depend of him with a syngle
heart: and a wieked thing it is, with man's curyous searchyng, to temple what
his power may extend to do. For he is of power to do all things, but he
will not do but what is best. With these and other ways more, did our head
master Jesus, suffer himself to be tempted of Satan immedyately in manner
after his baptysme: to the end that we should not think it to be
sufficyente, that all our sins have been forgeuen us through the lau^cre of
baptism: but that we must take in hand and enter a sharp battle with our
enemy Satan, who will leave nothing unattempted, for to draw us back again
into our old bondage. At our bap^ysme we monster to the behoufe of our
captain, and we promise to watre under his banners against the army of
Satan. And as for ^enne of this world we have nothing to do withal, in the
way of any querell, forasmuch as Christ ^ommaundeth us to love, yea even
our enemies too: but we have to do with the wicked spirits: who fight
against us from on high, with fiery daries, and with much policy. But Jesus
our soueraygne has once discoumfeyghted all their powers, and therefore has
delivered them into our hands easy enough to be vanquyshed: yea and will
eftesoones subdue them in us, if we will follow the same trade of fyghtyng,
whereby Christ brought them under subieccyon. They assault us some whiles by
themselves, putting ungodly thoughts in our hertes: many times by eyuell
men, as their souldyers, they assail us when they procure and make out
messagyers that may provoke us to all sensual ^olup^^ousenesse, that with
braullyng and with raylyng words may move and friere us to wrath and
manslaughter. And baytes wherewith to catch us they som^whiles fette of this
world, the promocions, richesse, and pompes whereof, they do by heaps cast
into our iyes.

And many times even out of our own selfs they take baytes for us. For there
be in us certain affeccionate pangues of nature, which we are not able to
cast away from us unless we should utterly shake of our humayne nature, as
for exaumple, appetite to meat and drink, desire to fulfill the lust of
carnal concupiscence, after that nature has made us of full age thereto. And
although moderately to use carnal copulacion with the lawful wife is none
enormitie: nor against the high pleasure of God it is, to allaie thirste and
hounger with meat and drink: yet in this behalf does our subtle and wylye
enemy lie in wait for us, that either we may give these affeccions the
bridle in taking more then for the suffisaunce of nature is necessary, or else
appeace the rage of them by such ways as is not conueniente. Of which sort
for exaumple these that here follow may be: as if one should touch an other
man's wife, or use his own wife immoderately, or do the act after facions
unseemly: or if one should with offending his Christian brother, eat of things
offered unto Idolles, when he may avoid that slaundre, and yet otherwise well
enough relieve the necessity of the body.

There be also in every of us certain special inclinacions both of the
body and of the mind to certain vices, whether it so be, that the same were
first taken of our parents, and so have sticked still in us, or whether they
have been taken of a custom, or else whether they have by any other means,
come unto us. As for exaumple: one manne is of nature more prone to couetise,
an other to glottonie, an other to leacherie, another to wrath, an other to
ambicion. Of all these does our enemy leave not one thing vnwatched, whereby
he may draw us to damnacion. But we must against his lying in a wait, And
as soon as all the temptation was ended, the deiuill departed from him.
be both stout and also diligent in watchyng. The spirit of Christ shall
give us both strength and wit against all his ingiens: and the holy
scriptures shall minister unto us armoure and weapon enough.

He that suffers us to be tempted, will not suffer us to be ouercommed: but
will so order the fight, that the end of the field and battle shall turn
to our benefit. Our enemy being put to the wurse, will not cease to have
envy at us, but he will at length cease to invade: and the oftener he shall
come, so much the more often discoumfeighted and weakened shall he at all
times depart again. For how the case should afterward stand with us,
Christ did now express by exaumple of himself. For after that the deiuill
had dispeched and spente out of all the fractes and crafty points that he
could against the Lord, and yet saw that he was never a whitte the nerer of
his purpose, being not only ouercomed, but also deluded and defeacted in
words, he departed away: howbeit but for a season, that is to say, to return
again to tempting when he might seek and procure an occasion thereto. For sense
the time that he could not get out of Jesus to profess that he was the
son of God, whom he was not hable with any goodly show of things to
corrupt: he afterward labored through the help of his soldiers the
Phariseis, the Scribes, and the priests, to put him to death. Yet even in
this behalf also, did Jesus by a godly policy, mock and defeat the
wiliness of his adversary: for the things that Satan with all his strength
labored to bring to pass to our castyng away, the same did Christ turn into
our salvation. Yea, and then most especially of all did Satan perceive his
tyranny to be clean overthrown: when he assured himself of most undoubted
victory. First came baptism, which gives the state of innocence: then
afterward came wilderness, and continual prayer, fasting, and therewithal
battle with Satan, against whom we are most chiefly armed with auoydyng the
coumpanie and resort of people, among whom there is in no place wantyng matter
enough to provoke and stiere weak minds unto vices more then one. Prayer
fenseth and gardeth the soul: Fasting abateth the strength of the body, and
increases more strength in the soul.

There was now nothing remaynyng, but for Jesus to address himself to the
office of teaching. And this is the very true office most specially belongyng
to Bishops, which office no man does after a right sort take in hand,
unless he be many ways tried and proved, unless he be found a conqueror
and a subduer of all naughty appetites, which do corrupt and peryshe the
word of God, so that he may be hable to teach others too, by what means
they may resist Satan. For it is not enough that a teacher of the gospel be
pure from vices, but he must also be stout and incorrupt, that neither for
lucre, ne for any sensual pleasure of the body, ne for ambicion, ne for the
fear of any eiuylles, he will declyne from the upright straightness of the
truth of the gospel, which truth Satan does not at any time cease to
assault by such persons as love this world more then they love the glory of
God.

And this the Lord Jesus being minded to teach us, after the premises all
finyshed and dooen, returned now again into Galile in great power and virtue
of the spirit which he was replete withal. For of the temptacion aforesayed,
And Jesus returned by the power of the spirit into Galile.
he had gathered strength of the spirit, not that any spice of any new power
had grown unto him more then he had fore: but for that the thing which he had
in his mind, did more utter and show furthe it self, setting out unto us
therewhyle, as it were in a plain picture, what the charge and care of an
evangelical teacher ought to be, and what he ought to look for. It was his
will and pleasure to begin his first preaching of the gospel in Galile,
being the most abiecte and basse region of the Jews: partly, to agree
justly with the prophecy of Esaias, in which it was foresayed, that about the
coasts of Zabulon and Neptalim, that is to say, nere to Galile of the
Gentyles, the light of Gods truth shall spryng up: and partly to the
entente that no part of the prosperous procedyng of the gospel, should be
imputed to the aid or maynteinaunce of this world, in case the gospel had
been taught or brought to light by learned men, by rich folks, or by men
of power, or in case it had sprung up out of a region being any thing famous.
For God did of a purpose choose and pick out all things vile and abiecte in
worldely estimacion, to the end that all the whole glory of so marueilouse a
matter should redound unto himself. And even now already was the fame of
Jesus not unspoken of among the people of Galile, with whom, by reason of some
miracles privately showed that all the world knew not of, he was come in
knowlage to many, yea, even before his baptism, a few disciples even at that
time gathered unto him, whom it was his pleasure to have as witnesses of all
his whole life and doctrine. And even at the same very time, he by little and
little withdrewe himself from the affeccionate wills of his kynesfolkes,
because he would by his doing reach us, that kynesfolkes also do oftentimes
hurt the synceritie and pureness of doctrine. But after that John was cast in
prieson (for during the time of John's preaching, Jesus did in manner altogether
hold his peace, because there should no spice of contencion grow or arise
between the disciples of the one and the other whether should have the
preeminence) he with a great courage enters the buisy office of preaching the
gospel openly in the face of the world. For it was now time, that the law
being restreigned and kept under bands (the figure whereof John did bear
the liberty of the gospel should put furthe the head, and show it self.
For enpriesonyng and feriers was most mete for the law being full of
shadows, and being derkened with mystical doubtful sayings: but mete it
was to set the light of the gospel up on high, to the entente it might
be open in sight to all regions and coasts of the world without excepcion,
as well to the greatest as to the least, as well to the learned as to the
unlearned.

Than as soon as the Lord was returned into Galile through the power of the
spirit of God, with whom he was filled, (which power was now as well by his
doctrine as also by miracles, partly vttred:) the fame which had to fore (as
ye would say) flighen abroad but among a few persons in comparison,
concerning Jesus, was than published and bruited abroad throughout all that
region. For unto a teacher of the gospel, a famous name is requisite: not
for that such an one ought to seek glory among men, but for that an honest
opinion of the teacher does purchase unto the same both credit and
authority. But the said honest opinion, as it is not to be desired, so is it
not by all manner ways to be acquired and gotten. Let a teacher of the gospel
according to the exaumple of Jesus so live, that whereas he makes no vaunt^e
voste of himself, he may yet nevertheless be advanced by the testimony of
the heavenly father, by the power and virtue of the holy ghost, and by the
voice of Ihon, that is to say, of every honest and good man, in whom the grace
of God rests: let him so live, that he may through the perfeccion of his
living and behave our, turn the iyes of all folks upon him. And to be short,
let him be of such feith and constaunt affiaunce in God, that if the case
should so require, he may glorify God even with showing miracles too, howbeit
(as the world now is) it is a miracle great and great enough, if such an one
neither with richesse, neither with sensual pleasures, nor with worldly
promocion, ne with dreadful offering of torments, ne with the fear of death
it self, will not any whit at all be turned from the pureness of the verity
eua^gelicall. Now among the Jews it was a custom, And he t^u^he in their
Synagoges.
that often seasons, but most specially on the Sabooth days, the people
assembled together into the temple, or into their Synagoges, to thentent that
the time of restyng which the law enjoined them from all filthy and secular
works, should not be spen^e on dycing and cardyng, on harlottes, on
banquettyng and reuelyng, on chydyng and brallyng and other very naughty
vices: but to be bestowed about things perteynyng to the soul. And in the
said temple or Synagoges there was talking of one with an other, not
concerning triflyng matters of the world, but about the law of the Lord,
about Messiah to come, who was with most ardent prayers looked for of all good
and godly folks. And what every man could, he conferred and declared among
all the presence of what state or degree soever he were. And whosoever made any
countenance that he had what to teach unto the people, there was delivered
unto him a book of the law of God, wherhence it is the part and duty of a
teacher of the gospel, to fette out wherewith to feed the souls of the
people, and not out of the dreams of men. And whatsoever thing was in this
place and audience done, could not be privy or hidden, because there stocked
thither a great multitude of all sorts and degrees of people.

Jesus therefore willing his doctrine to be known unto all creatures, as he
walked throughout the cities of Galile, he used according to the lawdable
custom of the Jews, to come into their Synagoges, showing forth every where
the same wonderful and piththie doctrine of the kingdom of heaven, being of so
much more power and force then the doctrine of the Phariseis, (who preached
naught but the utter rynde of the law and the constitucio^s of men, And was
commended of all men.
) as wine is stronger of herre and operacion then water Neither did there lack
among the people of Galile, some minds apt and desirous to learn, which
marueiled at this new kind of doctrine, and which did reverence the
wonderful teacher thereof, highly praysyng and manifying him.

And hitherto verayly the ghospelles cause did sufficiently well proceed,
until he came to his kynsfolke, and to the knowelage of his familiar friends
and acquaintance, becau^^ we should understand, that he which teaches
heavenly things, ought as much as he may, to estraunge himself from the
fleashe, and from the blond of his kindred. For when he had passed through
certain little towns and cities of Galile, at the last he came to Nazareth, in
which place (by reason that he had been there brought up of a young
nourcechylde, and had long time lived there with his parents and kynsfolkes,)
he was supposed of many to had been borne, and for the same cause was also
commonly called a Nazarean. And to thentent the Nazareans should not find
themselves grieved, that he had thought skorne of his kinsfolks and aliau^ce,
as one that had more mind and desire to go hunting about for glory among
people of strange parties where none of his kynne dwelt: he came thither also
to Nazareth being now a man of great fame, and much spoken of, whereas he
had tofore had no such fame in those quarters. And because he would declare
that he had now renounced and given up all private business and affayrs of
the world: he came according to his accustomed manner into the common Synagoge.
For no where ought such a man to be more conuersaunt, then in the temple,
whosoever is consecrated to the profityng of all folks in general. And stood
up for to read.
And when he heard others treatyng and reasonyng of Moses law, he also arose
up, signifying by that gesture (as others used to do) that he also being
inspired with the holy ghost, had some thing in his mind that he was willing
to speak before the multitude being there assembled. Which custom even at
this day endures in the churches, by the ordinance of S. Paul, that men
shall speak and hear by course. And in case any man have any thing opened
unto him by reuelacion, worthy or mete to be known, he that spoke before,
shall leave of, and shall give place to the party that succedeth him, because
that no troubleous noise, and confusion of speaking, so as one may not be
heard for an other, shall arise in the holy congregation, in which it is
decent, that all things be done with peace and tranquillity.

The book was delivered unto Jesus, And there was delivered unto him the
book. etc.
and that according to the custom and usage, for us to be enstructed and
taught thereby from whence the doctrine of salvation ought to proceed, that is
to we^e, not out of the inuencions of men, not out of the posicions of
Philosophiers, but out of the book of holy scripture, which has been
reveled unto us by the secret instincte and operacion of the spirit of God.
Jesus, in whom all the treasoures of knowlage and wisdom were hidden, had no
need of any book, but yet he took the book, because he would commend unto
us the ear^est setting of our minds on the readyng of holy scripture. The
minister of the Synagoge reaches forth the book unto him, but he took it him
shut. Jesus, who alone has the key and opens that is laid up hidden in
the old law, when he had taken the book, opens it, and turns it. For
Jesus himself lay secretly hidden, and diepely hidden in the law. And truly
mete it was, that the Jews selfs should give the thing, wherewith they should
anon after be convinced. And the book that was delivered unto Jesus, was not
at all auentures, as though it forced nothing what book it were, but it was
the book of ye Prophet Esaias, then whom, never did there any man either more
clearly, or else more evidently prophecy of Christ, And when he had opened the
book. etc.
and of the doctrine of the ghospel. Neither did the thing by a blind chance
so happen: but it was so conueighed by gods providence, that the book being
opened abroad, and a leaf turned, that same very place came chiefly fyrs^e to
hand, the which did most ^erely and plainly talk of Christ, and in the
which, Christ by the mouth of the Prophet speaks of himself in this
manner: The spirit of ye Lord is on me, because he has enointed me: to bring
glad tydinges to the poor by preaching of the gospel has he sent me: to
heal the contrite, that is to say, thoroughly broken in heart: to preach
remission and free deliverance to such as are in captivity, and sight unto
the blind: to set freely at liberty such as are all bruysed: to preach the
year of the Lord both acceptable and much to be wished for: and to preach
the day of retribucion. When the Lord Jesus had with his own voice pronounced
these words standing upon his feet, he redelieuered the book shut together
again as he had received it, unto the minister, signifying by his so doing,
the obstinate unbelief of some of the Jews, who sittyng still beatyng on the
letter of the law, did neither understand, ne would acknowleage Christ
being the soul and the life of the law. Now immediately after this, takes he
on him the part and office of a teacher, and sat him down quietly about to
expoune the sentence that he had read. As touching that he read the text of
the Prophet standing on his feet, And sat down.
it was a thing done for the authority of the scripture of God, whereunto it is
mete that all dignity of man do reverently humble it self. As touching that
he taught sittyng down, it is for a declaracion, that an expouner and preacher
of Gods holy scripture, ought to be void and altogether clear from the
troubleous unquietness of all carnal and worldely desires.

But partly the new fame which had now already begone to be spread abroad of
Jesus, and partly the authority of a teacher, which he now first of all took
upon him, and finally a certain heavenly grace shyning in his very
countenance, did cause that the iyes of all the people, which were then
present in that congregation, were earnestly fixed on him, for such an
audience does the Lord Jesus love, as keep their Sabbath, resting from all
troubleous desires and affeccions of this world: such as with mutual
concord one with an other are gathered together into one place: such as have
the iyes of their mind loking none other way, but straight upon Jesus, but
straight toward everlasting salvation. For he daily speaks unto us in the
mystical scripture of God: he speaks by evangelical Prophets, that is to
say, by the enterpretours and expouners of the holy books of scripture. But
happy and blissed are they, to whom the Lord Jesus speaks, they geuyng such
earnest iye and ear unto him. For to such does he vouchesaue to open the
mystery of the deep hidden sense. This day is this scripture fulfilled in
your ears.
For as soon as he saw the iyes of all the presence cast full and whole, and
fixed on him alone, he begone to say unto them: Ye have now heard the
Prophet Esaias by the inspiracion of the holy ghost, promising unto you a
certain excellent and mighty teacher, who should, not out of a worldly
spirit teach constitucions of me^ or vain fables serving to no good purpose,
but being aboundau^tly enoynted and replenished with the spirit of God, should
be sen^e from the same, to bring the glad and wishable tidinges of salvation to
such as are meke and poor in spirit: and by reason thereof are apt to
receive the wholesome doctrine of heaven: and which teacher should be of power
and ability to perform the thing which he should bring tidings of, as one
endewed with heavenly virtue and power: which teacher also should freely
bring salvation unto all creatures, as many as acknowlagyng their own
naughtiness and offenses, did wyshe for salvation: which teacher. moreover
(all manier sins being freely pardoned) should help all such as had their
hertes corrupted with many sondrye diseases of vices and of naughty lusts:
which teacher ferthermore should preach deliverance and setting at liberty
unto all persons, that either being given to Idolatry were kept fast of the
devil as captives and prisoners, or else being as thrall to the supersticion of
the law, might not reach ne atteigne to the liberty of the spirit: which
teacher besides all this, should through faith open the iyes unto such as were
blind in soul, and abode in a most diepe myste of manyf^lde errors, in
such wise as with their said iyes they should be hable to behold and look
upon the light of the eternal vecitie according to the prophecy, which
the same Prophet wrote in another place: where he says, the people that satte
in darkness has seen a great light. Which teacher over and above the
premises, should restore unto their first state of fredome, all such
persons, as seemed to be all crushed and bruised to pieces by Satan with all
kinds of euilles: and which teacher finally should declare in open preaching,
that the true Iubilee of the Lord was now come, a time like as to be hertely
wished for of al creatures, even so with most ardent minds to be accepted
and enbraced of all people without excepcion.

Moses gave a tradicion of a sabbath of days, in which he commanded that
every seventh day, they should all rest from sloumbreyng or uncleanly
occupacions: he gave also a tradicion of a sabbath of years, in which he
enjoined that every seventh year it should be rested from tillyng of the
earth* neither any thing to be required of the same, saving what it would
bring forth of it own self. He gave ferthermore a tradicion of a year, called
the restorer of the first state of liberty, unto which, (of the property of
the thing) was given the name of Iubilee, among the Hebrews. This year of
Iubilee came about in course again after vii. times seven years, and was
evermore the fyftieth (for seven times seven makes.x.ix.) And this year of
Iubilee was most hertely to be wished for of all the Israelites, that either
with bond service, or else with debte were any thing oppressed. But like as the
sabbath of Moses refreshed men's bodies only with being at rest and quiet:
so did the seventh year only provide for the resting of the earth from
tillage. But now there is showed unto your knowelage a perpetual sabbath,
never to be interrupted or broken: in which the mind and soul being free
and vacant from all troublous unquietness of eiuil desires, ought wholly to
atte^de to the quiet applying and exercise of heavenly things, and not now
with pensife earefulnesse to provide altogether for yearthly things,
forasmuch as to them that love God, no manier thing at all is wantyng. Yea,
and moreover the Iubilee of Moses did not help any others but only the
Israelites: it gave neither free deliverance, ne yet full deliverance, yea
and thatsame very thing which it did give, exte^ded no ferther then to the
body, and enduted but for a short time. But this year of the Lord, does
unto all persons, whosoever are endebted to the devil through sin,
whosoever be as bond servants subject to evil spirits, whosoever through
ignorance of the truth are blind, whosoever be in all kinds of
naughtiness so far paste, yt they are unable to every good work: unto all
such does this Iubilee of the Lord bring perfect and free remission,
deliverance or liberty, sight, health, and complete perfeccion in every
behalf. So much the more therefore ought ye with prompt zeles, and endeuoures
to enbrace that is offered. For the thing that ye have heard promised by the
prophecy, ye may now if ye will, in the deed self find to be true. Ye have
heard it with your ears, but ye have need of ready and desyrefull hertes, if
ye will be apt to receive so great a blissefulnesse. It is even the highest
thing that possibly may be, whereof this free offer is made unto you. But woe
unto them, that shall despise the bountiful and gracious goodness of God, so
wyllingly offreing it self unto them. It is the year of Iubilee, freelye
offreyng deliverance and salvation unto all such as with mekenes of
submission, and with readiness of beleuyng, show theimselfe wylling to be
taught, and apt to receive healing. But after this year of Iubilee must
succeed and follow the year of retribucio^ and redress: which shall adiudge
and ministre everlasting peynes in hell unto all such as shall have refused
the goodness of God. By these words did the Lord Jesus in an humble and
sobre manier, signify himself to be the same man, of whom the Prophecy of
Esaie did make promysse: whereas the most part believed the said place of
the Prophet not to concern Messiah, but to concern Esaie himself. For when
Jesus was in baptisyng, the holy ghost slydyng down from heaven in the
visible likeness of a dove, and lighting upon his head, did all the people to
wete, that thissame was even veraye he, whom the prophecy had meant of.
Enoyntyng betokens a certain mylde and ientill still thing. For there is
nothing more ientill, supple, or caulme, then oil: whereof was even that name
Messiah given him, which is in Greek Christon, in Latin Vnctum, in English,
the enoynted. For as for the preaching of John, it was sharp, and sour, and
full of threatyng: but Christ did with mildness, with courteous
familiarity, and with beneficial good turns continually move and pray the
people to receive salvation. When Jesus did with most high authority and no
less myldenesse speak and treat of the premises, many had him in great
estimacion therefore, And albate hi^ witness, and wondered at ye gracious
words which proceeded out of his mouth.
and merueyled at his talk being very far unlike to the talk of the
Pharisees: that is to wete, caulme, mylde, and meke, amiable, poudred with
much grace, having in it no spice of haultnes or pride, no point of sour
look or presumpteous taking upon him, and yet nevertheless of such sort,
that it contained in it condign authority. For the words of the Pharisees,
because they issued forth from an heart corrupted with ambicion, with
avarice, with envy, and with many other naughtye affeccions, did most times
smacke of the spryng that they gushed out of. But the words which proceeded
from the mouth of Jesus because they welled forth from a breast replenished
with the heavenly spirit of God, were not only amiable and sweet unto all
good folks, but also piththy and effectual toward salvation. Yet
nevertheless some there were among these Nazareans, in whose minds and
opinions the meanness of Jesus kynred and family that he came of (to the
outward acceptacion of the world) made the authority of the heavenly
doctrine to be the less regarded. For in consideracion that they every one
did yet all this while believe him to be the son of Joseph and Marie, and
that the slender ability and substance as well of Joseph and Marie both, as
also of their aliaunce and kynsfolkes was not unknown: in consideracion also,
that they had seen him many years even from his chyldehood to had learned at
noue other school, saving only his fathers occupacion of carpentrie: ne at
any time to had haunted the schools of the Pharisees and of the expert
lawiers, (who taught the mysteries of the holy scripture books with much
high solemnity and haultenesse of countinaunce:) they did much marvel
where and how he had soodaynly gotten so great virtue and power, which he had
to fore showed forth in other cities by diverse and soondrye miracles: they
mused where he had gotten that same wondrefull knowlage of divinity books:
they wondered where he had gotten so great eloquence to speak after that sort
with authority. For they did not yet understand, of how much more power and
effect the enoyntyng of the spirit of God is, then the doctrine of the
Phariseis. Estemyng him therefore by the things which they knew in him after
the flesh, they said: Is not this same fellow the son of Joseph the
carpenter? for they knew not the heavenly father, who than wrought by his
soonne. And because that Jesus wrought far fewer miracles in the city of
Nazareth, then he showed in other cities, certain of his kynsfolkes being
half in a fume and indignacion therewith, detracted and reproved him, as
though that either he had not his power ready to serve him every where, or else
that he oughed his own kynsfolkes such despite, that he would show no
miracles among them, wherein they hunted for a certain worldely praise and
glory to theimselues ward by such a matier, Whatsoever we have heard done in
Capernaum. etc
the glory whereof was altogether due unto god. The ungodly murmuryng of these
persons, did Jesus rebuke and alaie with such sayings as here follow.
Because ye have heard (says he) that I have elsewhere among others healed all
kinds of diseases: verayly ye will say unto me, that is wont to be said in
a common proverb: Thou physician heal thine own self. We have heard say,
that thou haste wrought certain woondrefull things above the course of nature
in the City of Capernaum, where thou were but a straungier, not having there
any that are nere of blood or kindred unto thee. But convenient it were that
thou should be beneficial most chiefly to thine own kynsfolkes: what
thou dooest to thy countrymen and kynsfolkes, No prophet is accepted in his
own countraye.
the same thou dooest unto thine own self. Therefore if this virtue and power
of thine, be appropriate unto thee, and contynuall in thee, than whatsoever
thou haste dooen among the Capernaites and straungiers, do even here likewise
among thine own kynsfolkes being most nere unto thee: and do it here in
thine own country. Unto the wieked murmoure of their hertes being now
disclosed and vttreed, the lord answered in this manier: I am in deed a
Phisician ready to heal all the diseases of all creatures, if any party
show himself apt to be healed. For no phisician (be he never so well learned,
ne never so well willing to do good,) is hable to help or cure the sick, if
they cast the medicine away from them, when it is offered them, and mistruste
the feythful phisician. And in deed this is the affeccio^ of the most common
sort of men, that they esteem the phisician so much the more, that he is come
a man unknown, out from some far country or region: and in such a place
does he find more trust and affiaunce to be put in him, where he is esteemed
by none other thing but by his art and by the name of a phisician. And in deed
as touching his cu^nyng which he carries about with him where ever he goes,
he is at all times and in every place one manier a man: but where he fyndeth
men full of mystrustyng and contemners, he cannot by his cunnyng do good to so
many: not for that he has in such a place any less will or else power on his
own behalf, but because the parties, whom his mind and will was to relieve,
will none of the benefit of health for despite and grutche that they bear to
their own selfs. And the same that chances to the phisicians, does much
more chance unto the prophets. For the cunnyng of phisicians does often
times help some, yea, whether they will or no: But the Prophet because he
does most chiefly cure souls, has it not lying in his power, though he
would, to help such as refuse salvation when it is offered. And refuse it he
does, whosoever mystrusteth. And many for none other cause mystruste the
Prophets, but because they esteem the same, not of the power of God werkyng by
them, but of the weakness of body, which they see in them like as in other
mortal men. Turn ye the stories of the old prophets over, and over and ye
shall find it to be a thing of most undoubted certayntie, that I now say
unto you: which is, that never was there yet any Prophet had in price within
his native country and among his own kynsfolkes: not for that they be less
hable or willing to do good to their own friends, then to straungiers or
foreine persons, but because the unbelief of the kynsfolkes makes them
unworthy of such benefit at gods hand.

For the benefits of God are not given for the respect of kynred, but for the
good heart of a man: not to the cousynage of the fleashe, but to the
promptness of the spirit: not to the nation, but to the feyth. For this I
affirm unto you for a matter out of doubt: that in the time while Helias was
living, when by the continual space of three years full, and six months,
there had fallen down no rain from heaven, and the baraynnesse of the
earth by reason thereof, had oppressed all the quarters there about with great
famine, there were many wydowes in the nation of the Israelites: and yet the
said prophet being nere at the point to peryshe through hounger, he was not
sent to any one of them all to be fed, but unto the wedowe of Sarephtha, in
the countreye of Sydon. Why was he not rather sent to the wedowes of
Jerusalem, there to multiplye the steane of meal, And many lepres weri^
Israel, in the time of Heliseus. iiii. Reg. v.
and the pitcher of oil? or to show a notable miracle to some one of them by
restoryng a dead child unto life again? Forsothe because that among the
Israelites there was not one of all the wedowes, that could egually match or
compare with the sincere feyth and affiaunce in God, of the said heathen and
barbarous woman. She being desired, gave him water readilye without any
styckyng: and when he promised that her steane of meal, and her pitcher of
oil should not waste, she believed, and made him pottage as she was bydden to
do. This was forsothe a mind and heart of an Israelite in a woman being no
Israelite: so far is the good heart more regarded and esteemed before god, the^
is the blood or kynred. And did there not a much like thing befall in the time
of Heliseus the prophet who succeeded Helias? For no doubt there is, but that
among the Israelites there were many Lepres, the which found a great miss of
their bodily health: Why than was never an one of the^ made clean by Heliseus,
but Naaman of Syria, being before that time and ydolatre, and an aliene borne
to the nation of the Israelites? Could not the prophet have been hable to do
the same among his own country folk, that he was hable to do on an aliene
and heathen man? Was he (trow ye) more quick and ready to do good to such
as were not of gods religion, and yet borne in a foreyne country too, the^ to
men of his own people and nation? No. But the feith of the man deserved that
benefit of gods hand. For he had a sure feith that god was hable by his
true servants to do as great a thing as that. And when he was bidden to
plounge himself seven times in fluime Jordan, he obeyed and did it. If the
lepres of Israel had had the same feith with them, eue^ they should have felt
the beneficial goodness of God too.

When Jesus had with these sayings, plainly without any flaterie or color
laid to his countrymen of Nazareth their unbelief, for the respect whereof they
made themselves unworthy of gods benefits: and all under one did give half
a significacion, that the end would be, that the free gift of the power of the
gospel should pass away and remove, not only from his countrymen of
Nazareth, being unbelievers that would not turn to the feith, but also from
all the Jews in general, unto the wedow of Sydo^, that is to say, to ye
church of the Gentiles, and to Naaman of Syria, yt is to say, to the Gentiles
who before that time were idolaters and wurshippers of false gods: the envious
grutching and murmour of ye Nazarea^s turned into manifest indignacion and
fuming. For ye hertes of them every one were brought so far out of patience,
because he had been so bold to speak such words in the open Synagogue,
(preferring the peoples of Sydon and of Syria before the Israelites, whereas
the said people were me^ utterly abhorred and detested among the Jews:) yt
making a plain uproar and sedicion, they drove him out, and banished him the
city of Nazareth. And not being therewith satisfied, they brought him even to
the brough and edge of the mountain, upon which the same city was builded,
verylye myndyng and purposyng to tumble him down even there headlong. O
unnatural countreyme^: O favor of yt waueryng minded people, into how great a
madness suddenly changed. And after all this is done, they marvel that
salvation comes not to them whereas themselves do banishe away from them the
worker and geuer of salvation. They disdeyne to have the godly beliefulnesse of
the heathen to be praised, and yet do they not all the while emende their own
wicked unbelief: They did verai eagrely desire to have a phisician: and yet
cannot they abide to swallow down ye wholesome pille of the verity being
bittur in their mouths. They will needs have their bodies made hole, nothing
regarding ye diseases of the mind. And the medicine of the solle being sick,
is true and plain speaking: which because it is true, is thought sharp and
biting. They have more mind to pleasant flatreyng poiso^, though it work
death, the^ to a bitter medicine yt might bring them health. They require to
have miracles showed among them for vainglorie of the world, which Christ never
showed but for the health of men, and to gods glory. Neither was his cu^ming
into the world purposely to heal the bodies, which should within short space
after decaie and perish: but to cure souls that should live for ever. And now
consider me here, how peruersely and ouerthwartely ye Nazarea^s wurshipped and
served God. It was ye Sabbath day, and they rekoned it a thing against al
godsforbod on yt day to sewe a seame in a shoe: but when a countreyman of
their own, ientilly calls them unto salvation, they accou^pte it no wicked
deed at all, sediciously with all their force to drive him before them to a
place where he might break his neck. Forsouth Satan did his busy cure by
these instruments to accomplish the thing that he had to fore by his own
self tempted Jesus unto. And here found he bailliffes or servants, more
graceless and myscheuous, then himself. For Satan for his part durst not
presume any ferther, but to move Jesus that he would cast himself down
headlong from the high pinnacle of the temple: but these fellows swarmyng
together in a plumpe, hale and draw to a stiepe edge of an high mountain, and
as much as in them lies do toumble down at the same place, a countreyman and
tounesman of the same city that themselves were of, being known among them:
and one that had done them all good. Their wicked will did as much as ever it
was hable: but their wieked will had no such power as to do it. For the time
was not yet come in which it was expedient for us that Jesus should dye, who
in deed was come to suffer death for us, but not till his own time that his
heavenly father had appointed, nor any other kind of death, then which he
had specially chosen. Nor every Sabbath did like him for the purpose, but the
Sabbath of Easter, in which it was seemly for the lamb that should redeem
the world, to be offreed up in sacrifice: neither was a stiepe edge of a rock
or a mountain for his purpose, but the high exalting up on the cross. Lucifer
was toumbled down headlong out of heaven for his pride, and therefore is he a
buisie prouoker of others to sudden ruin, and downfallyng. The son of God
had of his own disposicion leat himself fair and sobrely down into earth to
the end that being hoighced up on the cross, he might draw up all things
unto himself, and might by exaumple of himself lift them up into heaven
through humility, whom that same prince and head captain of pride labored to
toumble down headlong into hell through presumpcion and unbelief. Neither was
Nazareth a place convenient for the executing of that sacrifice, but
Jerusalem. Jesus therefore suffered himself to be drieuen out of the City,
to avoid bestowing of his preaching upon people unworthy (which self same
thing to do, he taught his Apostles also:) But to be tou^bled down the rock
headlong he would not suffer, because it pleased him willingly of his own
accord to suffer death. What than did he? He turned not himself into a bird
or a serpente, But he departed through. etc.
or any other likeness made by some sleyght of iuglyng or legerdemayn, to
the^tent so to escape: but without any hurt at all, passed he fair and softely
through the mids of them, which tofore had violently haled and pulled him to
cast him down headlong: wherein he openly declared ye malice of man to have no
power on him, unless he would willyngly of his own accord, deliver himself
to be taken of them, and to be put to death. And with this only kind of
aue^gement was the most merciful Lord Jesus contented, that is, to forsake
and leave the^ who^ he perfeictlye knew to be incurable. Otherwise (if it had
so pleased him) it lay in his power eue^ with a mere beck to have drieuen
them all to breakyng their necks, who had haled him thither for the same
purpose. But his desire was rather to have them live, yt emedyng themself by
co^tinuaunce of time, they might of malefactors be made innocent, then to
cast them away at the wurste when they were offenders. For oftetymes if men
be restreigned of their benefit that they may not have it at their wills
wha^ they would so ready as they have had, it makes them the better to feel
the miss and lack of him that is ready for to do them good. Certes by this
miracle they might have been moved as well to reverence and acknowelage his
power, against the virtue whereof the conspiryng of the furious multitude was
not hable any thing at all to do, as also to love the goodness of him, who
when they had attempted the vttermoste mischief against him that lay in their
powers, yet was rather willing to reserve them to a time of repentance, then
to cast them away at the wurste to eternal punishemente.

Jesus therefore, forsakyng the proud city of Nazareth, being rebellious
against the doctrine of the gospel, came down and took his way toward a
city of Galilee called Capernaum; being a city of great richesse, and
therefore drouned in all r^ott^us excess, in all vesuptuousnesse, in ambicion,
in pride and in the other vices which customably are compaynyons to richesse.
But here because of their volupteous sensual living, he used no familiarity
of carnal conversation among them: (which familiarity has evermore been a
breder of conte^pte, and has used to make menes authority the less regarded.)
Wherefore here also in Capernaum, as his custom was elsewhere to do, he went
into the temple upon the Sabbath day, and preached. For the wickedness of the
Nazareans (being so great, that they had goen about wilfully to murdre him
being their best friend,) could not so weighe him, that being offended with so
heinous a deed of mischief as that was, he would forsake the country of ye
Jews, and forth with put over the gift of the gospel from them unto the
Gentiles: but now he fulfilled in deed the same thing, which he afterward
taught in words to his disciples: which is; that when they were drieuen out
of one city, they should flee unto another, not setting their mind, ne
deuisyng how to avenge their iniurye, but how to set forth the gospel
ferther and ferther, in such wise, as the malice of those that drove them
away out of their tounes, might profit to the expedicion of setting forewarde
the profession of the gospel. And Capernaites (although they were men all
given to worldly affairs, nor much abhorred from the maniers of the heathen,
among whom, by reason of the trade of bying and sellyng that the one used with
the other they were often conuersaunt:) he found much more ientil and honest
in taking or interpretyng his words, and doings, then he found his own
countrymen the Nazareans: They were astouned at his doctrine
to whom nevertheless for his well known, and thoroughly tried and continual
perfeccion of life, he ought to have been more derely beloved. For the
Caperna^^es very greatly woondred at the doctrine of Jesus: consyderyng that
it was no wash miengled gear, nor peynted and glossed as was the doctrine of
the Pharisees, of washynges, of truly paying the tithes of Mynt and Rue, of
castyng gifts into the offryng box of god, and of such other like things,
For his preaching was with power.
which rather contained supersticion then virtuous doctrine, and which were
laid upon the simple people to mayteyne the glory and luc^e of the pharisees:
whereas they theimselues that taught these things, kept not so much as the
chief commandments of the law: but the doctrine of Jesus was found
substaunciall and full of authority.

For first, whatsoever he taught was most certain truth, and also agreeable
with natural reason. Secondarily, it was of it self much material unto true
godliness, and to eternal salvation. Ferthermore* his singular perfeccion of
living, caused his doctrine to be regarded accordingly.

And over and besides all this, many a miracle was there wrought and showed by
him, with such power and virtue as had never been used ne seen there, which
evidently declared the doctrine that he taught to be of God, and not of man's
spirit. For the Lord Jesus did his miracles not for lucre or vain glory, but
first with them he succored the woeful necessities of such persons as were
in extreme distress, to the end that by doing them benefits, he might win
their hertie love: and secondely the miracles were for a time showed to the
bodily iyes, to the end that by the same miracles they might learn to believe
those things, which though they were invisible, yet were more earnestly then
any corporal benefits to be desired: lastely they were a figure and a
representacion of those things, that were wrought in their souls. It was now
the Sabbath day: and the people religiously and with great devotion rested
from the works forbidden, which yet of themselves were not evil, as for
exau^ple to go a iourneye to kiendle a fire, to grynde their corn, to press
their wynes, or to ^otche up their garment being broken or seamerent. Without
forth in deed it was Sabbath day, that is to say the day of rest, but
within their minds there was a great trouble and unquietness, which the
spirit of Satan did there reyse, who woondrefully tossed and vexed their
minds with diverse mocions of co^e^ise, of pride, of wrath, of auengyng
displeasures, and of envy. For there and no where else is the true. Sabbath,
where the spirit of the Lord quieteth the mind to rest from all vicious and
inordinate lusts. There was a man which had an unclean spir^^e
And of this thing there was even than present a certain figure in their
sinagogue, which was a certain man, whose body was possessed with an unclean
devil, and this exaumple was to us half a warning and a puttyng in
remembrance, in how much more miserable and piteous case they are, whose
minds are possessed with eiuils of vires, yea more foul and ill-favored, then
that deiuill was. For what deiuill is more unclean or more noisome then
lecherous concupiscence, then wrath, then ambicion, then the gredie desire of
money, then envy, then hypocrisy? With these deiuils and such others like,
were the Jews for the most part possessed, who dwelt in the Synagogue,
which synagogue had not as yet received the spirit of Christ: but was vexed
with so many deiuils as there reigned vices in them. Neither were they hable to
receive the most mylde spirit of the gospel, until the Lord Jesus expulsed
and drove out from them, that evil spirit of Satan that held them in his
possession. Wherefore the said party so possessed with Satan, being not
hable to abide the new virtue of Jesus: which privily uttered it self, began
to cry out horribly roryng. What have thou so do with us thou Jesus of
Nazareth?
Oh out out, what haste thou to do with us thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou
come to destroy us before the time? we know what torments abides us at the
last day. But now thy presence tourmenteth and vexes us before that day. We
require no salvation of thee, we ask no release of pain, but only pray
thee to delay or defer it until than. We never felt the like of these
torments by the presence of any other prophet. Whereupon it is not unknown to
us, who thou art. For doubtless thou art thatsame only holy of God, that
shall conquier all ungodliness, and drieue out of the world all vnclenesse.
The law has his holiness, the law has his clenesse: but thou art he
only, whom god had sanctified and declared holy with heavenly holiness. The
lord Jesus, would not suffer himself to be praised or spoken of by that
wicked spirit, And Jesus rebuked hi^.
but would all the glory of his praise to be referred to his father only, and
to come from him, knowing right well that this confession of the deiuill came
not forth of a sincere faith, but of a malicious will and purpose. For he
professes Christ to be Jesus, and to be the son of God, only to geat him
to confess the same of himself, and plainly to utter what he was to his harms,
dooyng the selfsame thing by the mouth of this man, that Satan the temptour of
him had to fore gonne about to do, and had labored in his own person: he
professes Christ of a subtle and crafty mind: not that himself might
atteyne salvation, but that he might let and hyndre the salvation of others.
Neither was it love that caused him to utter that voice: but fear of
punishemente. Wherefore as an eiuill and malicious vile slave of a desperate
mind impossible to be recovered to grace, he deserved to hear these thanks
for his confession.

Hold thy peace thou unclean spirit, and depart from that man, whom by
tyranny thou do possess: And said: hold thy peace and cum out of him.
I am come to save men. And when the deiuil had thrown him in the mids, he
came out of him, and hurt him not. At this imperial and almighty voice of
Jesus commaundyng him to depart, the unclean spirit when he had thrown down
the man upon the earth and vexed him, he departed from him: so that no harm
appeared dooen unto the man being now safe and clean delivered. That he threw
him down, it was an evident sign, of his perverse will, and a token that sore
against his mind he forsook thatsame his dwelling place. That he hurt him
not, it proves plainly, that the wieked spirits can hurt none of them, which
do wholly commit themselves unto the salueour. For the goodness of this one
Jesus only, is of more strength to save man, then the malice of innumerable
deiuils to destroy or hurt the same. Other men when they labor to deliver
men's bodies from noisome spirits, are wont to take for the purpose, and to
use all possible kinds of remedies, and things of virtue and strength to
put away that eiuill: as are (for exaumple) certain prayers specially
prescribed and appointed therefore, and made with certain words apt for that
purpose: burning of frankincense: sprincling of holy water, or other things
accustomed: certain herbs having a virtue and property to expel them: with
many other kinds of ceremonies not unlike the feacte of sorcerie, and
witchecrafte. And yet right seldom is it seen, that those things expel an
eiuill spirit. That if at any time he do depart out of him, he leaves
behind him some tokens and marks of his manifest malice: either tearyng away
some membre and lymme of his body, as a leg or an arm: or else leuyng
behind him some disease and sickness incurable. But when the people saw
that at the mere word and sharp commandment of Jesus, the eiuill spirit
suddenly departed from the manne, so that he was perfectly healed, And fear
came upon them all.
and not so much as the least mark or sign that could be of his eiuill
remained, they all that saw this done were astouned and began to wondre. And
thus they talked among themselves of Jesus.

What a strange case is this, that we see now such a thing done, as the like
has not been read ne herd? For he has the unclean spirits under his rewle
and obeysaunce, and commands them. And his commandments are of such
mighty power and authority: that they byandby, acknowleagyng him more of power
then themselves, do forsake a man in such wise, that after they be goen out
of him perfect health returns in place of sickness.

Thus the sight of this so woondrefull a miracle, caused that the name and fame
of Jesus bruited and spread abroad this act, not only in the city of
Eapernaum, but also throughoute all that region, And the fame of him was sored
abroad.
even into the Synagogue of the Jews, which lackyng the spirit of Christ,
made an uproar and a stiere through the spirit of Satan, against the truth of
the gospel: through the inspiracion of which Satan, the Nazareans attempted
to murdre the saluaour as is aforesaid.

Than departed he from the Synagogue, and entered into the house of Simon, to
whom the name of Peter was afterward given: whose mother in law was holden
with a very sharp feure. This woman's kinsfolk and alliance besought Jesus,
that as he undesired had expul^ed and drieuen out the deiuill from the man, (as
is aforesayed) in the Synagogue: he would be so good, at the desire of a
great many friends, as to heal this woman of her feure, and the rather,
forasmuch as she was of the allyaunce and affinity of Peter, a disciple of
his own, whom he entierly favored. Than Jesus to show and declare himself
ready to do good both priuatelye and openly, as well to his acquaintance,
as to those that were straungiers unto him, yea and unto all ages, young or
old, to all sexes, men or women, and to all states and degrees, rich or
poor: he came nighe, and standing hard by the woman, he threafued the feure,
And immediatlye she arose and ministered unto them.
commaundyng it to depart.

And forthwith at the Lords comaundemente, the sickness went quite away,
and the strength and lustiness of her body returned again, not by littell
and littell, as it commonly does in those which are cured at the hands of
phisicians: but the sickness being soodainelye drieuen away, the whole
strength and lustiness of perfect health, with a cherefulnesse of mood, was
in such wise restored, that she arisyng out from the bed where she had lain
sick, dressed the supper for Jesus, and his disciples, and served them while
they sat at the table.

And so ready was the Lord to do good and to help all men, that he never
did so much as lay for his excuse the importunity or vnseasonablenes of
time* to any that of simple and mere faith, and trust in him, required his
help and succor. For the matier being now openly blown abroad throughout all
the whole city: as many as had any sick folks in their house, which were
troubled with diseases of diverse sorts, brought their sick folks to the
door of the house where Jesus lodged. And he being a most ^entell salueour,
neither laid for his excuse that he was now from the people within doors
where he ought of reason to have quiet reposyng of himself from labor: ne
that it was night, and therefore an unseasonable time for such doings: but
upon all that ever were brought unto him, And he laid his hands on every one
of them.
he laid his hands that were evermore geuers of health and help. And all
kinds of diseases did he both easily and freely put away from all persons,
as one that minded by this exaumple to teach all men, that such as will be
free from the diseases of the minds, they must flee to none other but to Jesus
only, which is evermore ready freely to pardone and forgive how grievous
soever the offense committed has been: so that with sincere faith they turn
wholly unto him being the only auctour of true salvation. For there is no
kind of syckensse so incurable* so rooted to stick by a man, so deadly: but
at his touch and commandment it may be healed. And here is by the way,
set forth a pattern or exaumple to bishops* and pastoures, or curates that
succeed in Christ's place, with what myldenesse they ought to receive sinners
that are desirous to emende from their vice and sinfulness. For if the Lord
Jesus, in whom there was not so much as any one little prient or mark either
of sickness or of vice, would never turn away his face from any disease,
were it never so ougly or lothely to see: but that he would receive them to
him, but that he would touch and handle them, and also would heal them, how
much more than does it beseme those persons the same to do, whom the
benignity of Jesus has tofore pourged from the sickness of the mind, and
who yet neuerthel^sse in the mean time are not all free from all faults:
especially forasmuch as it is not they that take away the sickness: but
they are only ministers of the gift that comes from heaven, and have nothing
but the office of exortyng and stieryng others to ask and desire health, and
of bringyng them unto that mighty Phisician, and mouyng the same to mercy by
their intercession, that he will vouchesalue to touch their hertes and minds
with his hands, and so to heal them.

And not only syckenesse fled at the commandment of his voice, and at the
touching of his hands: And deiuil^ also came out of many
but also the devils not being hable to abide the godly power of Jesus, by and
by ere he commanded them, wy^lyngly fled out of the bodies of those miserable
creatures whom they had long time tofore possessed. So great a piece of
felicity and bliss it is to come nere unto Jesus. And nere toward him
does that person draw and come, who myslikyng himself, is desirous and fayn
to be made better, and the which conceyueth an assured confidence and feyth,
that all his sins, be they never so heinous and grievous, yet by the
unspeakable mercy of Jesus are freely and clearly forgeuen. There be in the
bodies diverse kiendes of sickness: and never a whir fewer diseases of the
soul, yea and these of the both the more perilous: except perchance ye will
think that there are fewer kinds of intemperancie and mysgouernaunce, then
there are kinds of fevers: or to be a thing of more ieopardie and daungier
that the body boil in a fever, then it is perilous for the soul to rage or
run mad in lecherous lusts.

And among the diseases of the body, some are so foul and lothely to see,
that a man's next friends cannot abide to come nere him* as for exaumple, to be
eaten with lyce: some again are so contagious and infectiue, that a man shall
he in ieoperdye to come nere unto such as have them* as the leprie in
especial, and the pestilence: albeit, (the truth to speak) few sickenesses
or diseases there be, but that one way or other they are infectiue. Again
some diseases there are, either so strong and sore upon a body, or else of
such long continuance, that they overcome and pass all cunnyng and cure of
the phisicians. But the power of our phisician is so great, that there is no
sickness whose greatness is above it, or to be compared unto it: more is
his pureness, then that it may be stained with any sins or eiuils of any
mortal creatures: greater is his mercy, then that it can loathe or abhor any
man's ouglye fylthynesse. He receives all men to him, as one of most
singular goodness: he touches all men himself being most pureste: he
heals all men as one most mightyest.

But on no diseases of the body are the phisicians less hable to do any
cure, then upon those sicknesses which corrupt the tabernacle of the mind
and reason, as for exaumple, the fransie, the forgetful slepie disease, called
of the phisicians letharge, albeeit in deed men possessed with deiuils are more
incurable then either of both these, because the wicked spirits being more
stronger then man's nature, do toss and turmoyle both their souls and
bodies, and vex them at their pleasures. Neither is it the custom to bring
such unto phisicians that are but men: but they are left to the heavenly
help of God.

For so great is the strength and power of this eiuill, that even to behold
the^ is a pieteous matier. But peradventure they seem not miserable, (although
in deed they are more wretched caitifes) that through the desire of reignyng or
bearyng a rewle over others, are drawn to poisonyng or to witchecraftes and
nigromancie, to sleaghing, yea the nerest of their kynne, to sacrilege, and
other mo deeds of mischief, more heinous then these: and such persons also
whom wrath carries violently out of the right way, to the spoylyng of
inculpable poor men, to the murdre of innocents, which have nothing
deserved, to making of war, to burning, to setting the whole world in a
rose, how little a portion is that eiuell that the party above said (whose
body the devil had possessed) does, or suffers, if it be compared, with
how great furies such an one is vexed, or how great confusion a prince
brings to the whole world, if he be set in a rage through the spirit of
tyranny. The violent force of this sickness and mischief overcomes man's
power to cure it. But the spirit of Christ is stronger then it, which, if the
mind of man have once conceived, it cannot be chosen but that all the
unclean spirits that would possess him, (be they never so many,) must
avoid and be goen. When this shall so be brought to pass, then shall he
suddenly be made of a tyrant, a father: of a cruel man a most merciful
governor: of a poller of the people, a relieuer and succourer of the
oppressed: When the sun was down, all they yt had
of a furious warrior, an ensewer of peace: of a briber and extorcioner, a
liberal dooer and a geuer of benefits: of a glorious crakyng Thraso, a sobre
and prudente prince of great experience. Only leat him be brought to Jesus,
and be led away from the world. For even than about the going down of
the sun, no small noumbre came unto Symons house, (that is to say) unto the
Church or congregation of Christ where the gospel is preached, and by the
power of Christ's* spirit the unclean spirits came out of them all, openly
protestyng that there was one come, whose goodness was mightier than their
malice.

For when they departed out of men, they cried and said: Thou art that same
veraye son of God. But as yet the time was not come, when the Lord would be
known unto all men that he was that same Messiah the veraye son of God:
and though he had been so minded, yet would he not that the unclean spirits
should be the troumpettes of his glory: either for that their confession was
not simple and of good purpose, but subtle and crafty: or because there was
ieopardie in it, lest if their witness should have been of any weight or
estimacion in this so great a matier, they should have been credited or
believed in other things, wherein they would (as their delight and felicity
was) beguile men with their false lies. For Satan in very deed, forasmuch as
he is of nature a lying marchaunte, although sometime he speaks the truth,
yet does he it only to this end, to deceive men thereby, another time and
way. And doubtelesse this craft have some men learned of him, who
intermiengle godly things among ungodly: true things with false: puttyng as
it were, deadlye poison into wholesome meats, that they may allure the mo men
to damnacion.

Wherefore Jesus teaching us that it becomes not such men as have once
consecrated themselves unto the holy ghost, to have any thing at all to do
with wieked spirits: he rebuked their clamouryng and crying, and sore
threatenings added he with all, to put them to silence. For they felt a
woondrefull strength and virtue to proceed, from him, and thereof suspected that
he was Messiah the son of God: even the same that was promised.

But Jesus truly, who was not come of most special purpose to heal the
bodies, but to cure the souls: nor to one city only, but to all countries
of the world: when he had by showing many soondrye miracles, and with the
wholesome doctrine of life well begone the castyng abroad of the sede of the
evangelical philosophy: very erely even at the break of day, before that
the multitude should eftsons flock thither to him, as people which came more
to gase and woondre at his miracles, and to seek bodily health, then to seek
the salvation of their souls: he leaft Capernaum, and withdrewe himself
departing into wilderness or places solitary, as one that would feign be
away from the great preasse and throng of people vaynly resortyng unto him,
teaching us a lesson by the way, that miracles are not to be wrought to a
vain oftentacion or braggue of our selves, nor yet at the will and pleasure of
the people for their fancies and appetites: but so far only, as they may
avail and grow to men's salvation, and to Gods glory: but the suspicion
of vayn-glorye evermore at all times to be vttrely avoided. That he healed al
men, it was an exaumple of goodness being prompt and ready to be showed unto
al men: yt he privily withdrewe himself, it was an exaumple of humilitee and
meekness, fleeyng vayn praises and vauntyng of himself. And kept hi^ y^ he
should not depart from them.
And wha^ it was now broad day light, there resorted thither again, as they
had dooen, great noumbre of all sorts of people, allured by the greatness of
things dooen on the day before. But when they knew that Jesus was goen, many
byanby followed after him. And when they had found him, they entreacted him to
tarry with them, and not to leave their city, but there with them to take an
house, to thentente he might be a continual dweller amongst them. This mind
and affeccion of theirs toward Jesus, was in deed not ungodly: but yet much
more blessed are they, which suffer not the Lord Jesus to depart from the
little house of their hertes, but when he addresseth to be goen, do with much
prayers call him back again. Notwithstanding at that present season, the
dispensacion and state of the flesh which Jesus had taken, did require, that
he often and many times chaungeyng places, might by that occasion from day to
day sprede ferther and ferther abroad the preaching of the ghosell, being as
yet but a new doctrine and but of late cummen up. For he was the sedesower
seute into the world, to sow and cast abroad in all places the doctrine of
the gospel, although it should not in all places like prosperously come up and
prove in growyng. Wherefore to them that willyngly desired him to return
again to Capernaum, and there to enhabite himself, he ientilly and coldely
made this answer. The benefit that has been freely bestowed upon you, take
it well in worth. I do not mislike your entreteynement or harbrough, ne
despise to be a so iourner among you. But I must of necessity preach the
kingdom of god to other cities to, as I have dooen to yours. For truly my
father has sent me for this end and purpose, not to preach to one city
only, but that I should call and bid all men to the fellowship and brotherhood
of the heavenly kingdom: And the same that Jesus now did himself, he taught
afterward his disciples also to do, for therefore I am sent.
which was, that they should travail over and over the whole earth, and
teach all nations. And this iourneyng from place to place, was not the disease
of ficlenesse or of unstableness: but it was the earnest affeccion to do good
unto all men. So to flitte from place to place, is no point of lightness of
man: but an evident sign of the charitee, that such as follow the steps of
the apostles ought to have. Yea and in places where the doctrine of the
gospel is riefe enough, yet a good watching shepehearde will not so leave to
walk to and fro round about his cure, as one that is careful for his flock
committed to his charge and custody: to the end he may call again the sheep
which was goen astraye: heal that is scabbie and sick: deliver that is in
daungier of the woulfe: see to the curyng of the torn or wounded: coumfort and
cherishe with good keeping, that is tender and weak. For they are not made
pastors or heardemen, to see to one or two householdes and no mo: but that
they should continually watch for the behoufe of all. This excuse thus made,
and the Capernaites therewith satisfied, Jesus went about from one to another
of all the villages, cities, and tounes of Galile, preaching, as his accustomed
wont was, in their Synagogues, and through the myracies which many times and
often he wrought, purchasyng credit unto his doctrine among the Jews, who
were so hard herted, that without miracles they could believe nothing.

The fifth Chapter.

ANd now forasmuch as the fame of Jesus was daily more and more bruited
abroad among alfolkes: so great was the resort of people sekyng unto him, that
to be emongst them, or to leate them have free access unto him in the
Synagogues, in the streets, and in the tounes was not enoughe: but into
whatsoever place the Lord at any time withdrewe himself, thither would a
great multitude both of men and women one among an other, byandby come
rennyng. A maignie of them the desire of bodily health had occasioned so to
do: a good noumbre, the strangeness of miracles did move: and veraye many
did the virtue and power of the heavenly doctrine draw unto him. The
desertnesse of the country lying waste and saluage, did nothing fear them
from coming to him, the peynefull climing of mountains did nothing discourage
them, nor the shame of forceable breakyng into this or that man's house,
could keep them from him, in case he had any where by occasion kept himself
secret within doors. Short tale to make, come they were at last to a great
pooles side: and yet when Jesus there addressed him to take bote, they could
not find in their hertes to leave him so neither. They gathered to him by
flocks, they let for no shouldring ne thrustyng to geate to him. They
forbear not to break in par^orce to places where he was, they hanged still on
him and would not away, they spared not in manier to bear him down before
them with importune pressyng to him. And here now, o friend Theophilus, in any
wise open me the iyes of thy mind, to the end that thou may in the
recityng of a thing dooen but after the fleashe, (that is to say by them that
did not yet perfeictelye know what that spirit was) very plainly see a
lively representacion of the church, both as it first sprung up, He stood by
the lake of Genezareth.
and also as it grew in time to a passing great noumbre: Jesus was standing on
the shore even hard by the poole called Genezareth, which poole (because it
shoots forth a great way both in length and breadth, and by reason of much
wind that arises of the poole self, it labors to and fro veraye often,
with many rough sourges) the Hebrews do often times call by the name of a sea.
It seemed to their thought, that he minded to take bote and to be goen. But the
vnrewly multitude flockyng about him, were evermore at the very holes of him
with importune throng, and pressed still upon him, for faynnesse to hear the
word of God out of his mouth. For as for the Phariseis talk and preaching, a
great many of them were even than already cloyed withal, and wetye of it,
because it sauoured altogether carnallye and worldelye, and nothing else. But
this importune facion of the people did nothing displease the most meke and
pacient lord Jesus, but as one compelled and being at a narowe straight,
(because on the one side the thick press of the people made importune
thrustyng, and on the other side the water was in manier even upon him,) and
seeing the place, to be but so so commodious for one to preach the ghospel in,
(for because that neither the people thrustyng still to and fro, and bearyng
forward one on an others neck, could well find suit footyng to stand quiet
in a dounhill place: and a voice that souneth from a very low place, comes
to a fewer noumbre: yea, and moreover it is conueniente that a man while he
teaches the gospel, may stand quiet and safe from pestreaunce of the
people, And he saw two dippes stand by the lanes side.
cloustreyng and throngyng together at adventure:) he withdraws himself into
a place, somewhat more quiet. And even as god would, there were lying at
the same shore two fisherbores. And the fyshermen selfs being goen out of
their botes, were washyng of their nets, to have them in a readiness against
the next fishyng time. Jesus when he had espied these fisher botes, he entered
into the one of them (and that was Simon Peter's bote) and prayed him to launche
a little from the land. Which being done, when he was by that means somewhat
removed from the pestreous throngyng of the multitude, he sat him down
quietlye: and out of the boat, as it had been out of a doctors chair, taught
the people sta^dyng on the shore. Out lord had before called fishers to the
office of preaching the gospel: And he sat down, and taught the people
out of the ship.
and even the same that Jesus now did out of the boat was to fish for men:
the poole was the world, wauyng up and down with soondrye troublous mocions
of things: Simons ship, was the church being first gathered of Jews: of
which church, Simon Peter should afterward be instituted the chief
spyrituall ministre, (and the word Simon, is to say in English, obedient,)
for the Jews, they required to have woondres showed them, and put all their
affiaunce and hope of salvation in the works of the law: the Philosophters on
the other side, did with natural reasons and arguments of man's brain hold
great disputacions about a thing that they called in their term, Sumo^^^
bonum, (as if ye should say in English, the highest, and most perfect good
thing, that could be) and thereby did they measure and esteem the felicity of
man, (which we call heavens bliss:) whereas the doctrine of the ghospel
promises unto al men salvation, through feith. And feyth is a kind of
obedience: for an obedient person he is that being bydden to believe, does
believe without any stickyng, and without any reasonyng: and which being bydde
to hope, does hope, dependyng altogether of his mere pleasure, to whose feyth
he has once yielded himself.

Thou have heard, o Theophilus, the first foundation and cummyng up of the
church: hear now the growyng and encreace of the same, which shall
consequently ensue of this evangelical fishyng. When the Evangelical sermon
was ended, the Lord Jesus spoke unto Simon that was master of the boat
saying: row the boat away ferther from the land, and have it forth into the
depth, and there shoot ye forth your nets abroad to take some fish.

Here Simon, (according to the term or word of his name,) answers in this
wise: Master all this night long have we labored in fysshyng, and have taken
nothing at all: and therefore being out of all hope to take any fish at this
time we have washed our net, and made it ready to lay up: yet at thy bidding,
I will once more shoot it forth. I shall (as my part is) be obediente to thy
bidding: the proof and luck thereof shall rest in thy hands. The lord Jesus
commandment was obeyed: the boat was had away to the depthe of the poole:
the net was cast abroad of a great coumpasse: within which there was even
by and by enwrapped and caughte such a great multitude of fyshe,
Nevertheless at thy commandment I will looce forth the net.
that the disciples net being a great deal to slender for the burden of the
fyshe, did break, and the one of the botes was not sufficient to hold the
draught that they had taken. In ye other bote were Simons fellows, to whom they
made signs, not in words, (because they were far of) but by other means,
that they should come to them in the other bote, and help them in
dischargyng their net of his great burden. They came, and they help them,
and there was found such a mighty great quantity of fyshe, that both the
botes were filled very full with the lucky speed of that one net, insomuch,
that by reason of being over laden with the burden, they were within little in
danger, of sinkyng. Thou haste here in Simon the form and Image of a
preacher of the gospel. The propre and most special office of such an one,
is to cast abroad the net of evangelical preaching, not out of the
Phariseis snares, not out of the Philosophiers sophisticacions but directlye
out of the rewles of holy scripture books, so knitte and made of the acts and
sayings of Christ; that it may enwrappe very many, and not let them escape
out again after they are once in. This world also has nets of it own, and
Satan has fishers of his own too: who do with flatreyng enticementes
allure the miserable souls of men, and towe them into the were and net of
damnacion, and so bring the^ at last to perishing for ever. But happy and
blessed are those souls whom the net of the Apostles has wound in, and
draws them up from the diepe doungeon of sins and of errors unto a more
open aier, out of darkness, into light, out of fylthie mudde, to a more purer
life, out of wandreyng affeccions to a constaunte zeal and endeavor of
continual living vpryghtly without offense. For they are not drawn to
murdremente, but to health and safety. They are so wound in, that they would
not by their good wills escape out, and in case they do escape out, they
peryshe. They are on every side encou^paced with the knottes of the truth
euangelical, they acknowlage their own miserable state, and rejoice that they
are drawn to the ship of the church. And for because that the net of
preaching does at times draw and catch with in his coumpace fyshes of
soondrye kinds out of al parties, it cannot be chosen, but that some eiuill
are miengled among the good. Therefore through the fault of the eiuil, the
net does break: but yet do not the good fishes therefore slip out.
Heritiques do attempt and labor to cut in sunder the doctrine of the
ghospel: but Christ on every side fencing those that are his, turns the
deiuelishe attemptates of the others, to the profityng and betteryng of the
portion that is uncorrupted. Some lade and trouble the ship with their
troubleous disturbaunce, being burdenous and heavy with the affeccions of this
world, and also couetyng to return to the mudde that they had least, but the
ship drowneth not which Christ has once bouchsalued to look unto. And
although there is no mo but only one church throughout all the world, yet
does the figure thereof for this cause contain two botes, that we should
understand, that the church is congregated of two peoples, the Jews, and the
gentiles. The beginning of our salvation proceaded first from the Jews. And
there among them did Peter first of all men, next after Christ, cast the
net of Apostolical preaching, and at one draught plucked unto Christ three
thousand of men and women together of al sorts, that was, when he played the
fysher to catch men. And his tale to the people at that time, was not linked
together with the art of Rhetorike, not intricate with the subtilties of the
Philosophiers sophisticacions: but mighty and effectual through the virtue
and power of the holy ghost. For he had not at that time cast out his net
abroad upon any trust that he had in the strength of man, but at the biddyng
of Christ only, with whose spirit he was than led. Or else is the net cast out
in vain, unless Christ send prosperous luck to man's castyng. But like as
from the Jews was the first beginning of this growing up: so from the Gentiles
came right plentiful increace unto it, insomuch that they which had first
cast their nets, were of force constreigned earnestly to require the help
of their fellows: For afterward, by reason that the Gentiles did on every side
violentely break into the brotherhood of salvation that cummethe by the
gospel, Petur and James gave their hands to Paul and Barnabas, in token of
their eguall feloweshyp concerning the affairs of the gospel: and so both
parties with as earnest endeavor as they might, did labor to fill up both
ships: and the matter so well succeeded, as it was to be wondered at.

Simon therefore, when he saw the matter to go not by man's power or by
casualty, but only by the godly virtue of Jesus, did eftsons give a lesson by
exaumple of himself, what ought to be done of him, that is a preacher of the
Apostles doctrine, if his labor of preaching do at any time luekely come to
pass. For although the boat was his own, although it was his own net
that he had cast, and although himself was the best manne that had set
hands to drawyng of the draught, When Simon saw this, he fell down at Jesus
knees.
yet takes he unto himself no thank at all thereof, but by the greatness of
his lucky spedyng, was strieke^ with the more humilitye. He falls down at
the knees of Jesus, and puts over unto him the whole glory of al thissame
act. For his own part he confesses himself to be naught else, but a sinner,
and a person unworthy to bet any ministre or instrumente of his divine power.
Master (says he) now and never before do I acknowelage mine own
unworthiness, when I considre thy high majesty. Go thou hence away from me,
for I am unworthy of thy compaigny. Lord go from me: for I am a sinful manne.
Albeit it was not any desire or will of him to depart out of the lords
compaignye, that enforced Petur to speak these words (for he loved Jesus
singularely above all others:) but a certain earnest merueilyng of his power
far surmountyng the power of the worldly mean.

Neither were Simons fellows of any other mind or affeccion, than Simon
himself was of. For a certain incredible wondreyng at this deed had possessed
the hertes of them all full and whole: but not somuche as one of them took to
his own praise any part at all of the doing thereof. For they acknowelaged
every one of them that the labor in deed was theirs, but the lucky speed of
taking so much fish at a draught was his only, who had bidden them cast
their net. And what manne would not be astouned if he consider how that
through the preaching of a few men being but poor creatures of birth and
degree, being also private persons, neither of any learning nor yet in any
office, it was within a few years persuaded to so many thousands of people,
that setting clean aparte all affeccions of their kinsefolkes, setting at
naught all loss or decay of their goods and substance, nothing regarding
the threattenynges of princes, despisyng al punishementes and tormentyng, yea
and finally death it self, they could find in their hertes to follow the
plain homely doctrine of Christ, believing such things as by man's natural
reason cannot possibly be proved, and hopyng on such things as after the
power and strength of nature, are plainly to be despaired of? A bisshope
therefore must of duetye be ready and cherefull to cast the net, that he
may earnestely apply himself to win very many unto Christ: and he shall
looce the net abroad not to his own glory, not to be a gayner thereby, not
at the pleasure and appetite of princes, not for any worldly affeccion, but at
the pleasure and bydding of Christ: who commands not the net to be cast
abroad, but to the health and salvation of them that are fished for, and to
the magnifiyng of Gods goodness. For this and none other is the Apostles
manner of fishyng. And such fishyng, although it be executed by the ministry
or service of man's voice, and of his diligente labor, yet the whole sum of
all the praise is to be referred unto Christ only: whose luckye setting on
at the first, looceth the tongue to speak, whose spirit does put in the
heart of the speaker what to say, and whose secret power drawethe unto him
the minds of the hearers. And standing the case, that it may be in the
teacher, even of his due right to take some piece of praise unto himself. In
this behalf, yet is it a more point of safetye, to refer all the whole unto
him, without whose aid and help, nothing that man attemptethe, does
succeed or prove to folks salvation. He can no skill to take away, that
himself has given: he can no skylle to enbraied any man with that that he
has frankely sent of his bounteous largess. So much the rather will he be
contented to leate any thing be thine own, if whatsoever might by any way
have seemed too be thine, And so was also James and John. etc.
thou be of the mind that the same shall be his. He will be well contented that
the commoditye and profit redounde to the: but as for the glory and praise he
will not suffer to be given to any other but to God only. And in case we have
a lust to glory, we shall more safely glory in him. But when the meruaylyng at
this act of Jesus made all them still to continue astouned, that had been
associate with Petur at the taking of the fyshe: (among which coumpaignie were
James and John the sons of zebedee, and fellows with Simon in fishers craft)
and whereas, And Jesus said unto Simon: fear not.
for merueyling at the virtue and power of his godhed, they durst not be so
bold as to approach any thing nere unto Jesus: the Lord gave them words, of
very great coumfort, and to Petur (in whom he was much accustomed to set
forth the pattern of any thing that he would have to be enpriented in the
hertes of all the rest) thus he said: Simon, there is nothing why thou
shouldeste be afearde, Thou dooeste acknowelage thine, own weakness, and an
experimente thou haste had of the power of god. And this power of god is to
be loved, not to be dreded. For what it is hable to do, it dooethe show
furthe, not to oppress the weakness of sinners, and to trede it under foot,
but to lift up and set it vprighte: there is nothing else required, but that
thou be obediente unto my byddynges, and not to weigh what it is that thy
strength is hable to do: but what it is that I will have dooen. Nothing
shall come ill forward, if thou put thine affiaunce in me. Thou doeste
greatly marvel, that the matter came so luckilye to pass in the taking of
fish: but this is but a light matter. A thing of much greatter woondre shall
prosperouslye go forward with the, From hens forth thou shall catch men.
when thou shalt beegynne to take men with thy fishing. And to such a kind of
fishyng, have I specially chosen out both the and thy fellows. Enough now for
this time of this fishyng that ye have hitherto used. From henceforth thou
shall apply thyselfe, not to fill this bote of thine with fyshes, but that thou
may replenishe my church with preachers of the gospel. And that, that the
Lord spoke unto Petur, the same did every one of them understand to be spoken
unto them too. Therefore even out of hand their botes being conueighed to
land and all things left even there behind them, they went after Jesus,
void of all care concerning things corporal, and with all their whole minds
bente to the purpose to be fyshers of men.

To this noble office of fishyng for to catch men, they were to be framed
with enstruccyons and good lessons, they were to be trained with mystical
exaumples. To the entente therefore that he would declare no vice or fault to
be so abominable ne so deadlye, that is not by and by forgeuen to any that
will acknowelage his disease, and will through the feyth of the gospel
earnestly call for remedy at the hand of the heavenly phisician Jesus: it so
fortuned, that in a certain city, a certain man there was right grievously
infected with the impediment of the leprosy, Behold there was a man full of
leprosy. etc.
and all the whole body over veraye full of a foul and a lothely scourue to
see. And this sort of people was in such wise abhorred among the Jews, that
all such were clean exiled from coumpaigniyng with any others, and the law
in express words did straightly forbid and charge, that none such should
be so much as touched, for the daughter of infeccion that would immediately
follow thereby. But a great deal fouler, and much more to be abhorred is
the leprosy of the mind, then of the body. But the Jews, whereas themselfes
swimmed as full as their skynnes might hold, of many great vices that lay
inwardlye hydden within the skin: yet did they so greatly deteste and abhor
ethnikes, publicanes, and other persons known to be sinners, that in case it
happened them at any time no more but to talk with any such: as soon as they
came home again to their own houses, they would make a washyng of all their
body from top to toe, as though they had taken some veraye sore infeccion. But
Christ's mind was to have his disciples far from this presumteous clenesse
of the Jews.

To the manne therefore being thus piteously arrayed with the leprosy, it was a
great good turn, that he saw Jesus. He acknowelaged his uncleanness, and judged
himself a man unworthy to hold up his face and look on the Lord, seeing
that it was to be abhorred and lothed of all men for the foul ploches of the
leprye: but being much ashamed of himself fell down postrate and groueleyng on
his face, and spoke out words both full of humility and also of assured
trust in the Lord. That he hid his face, was a point of one that
acknowelaged his own eiuill: that he prays to be made whole, was a point
of one being of undoubted affiaunce in the goodness of Jesus Christ, being
both of power to do all things, and readilye offreyng it self unto all
creatures, Lord if thou will, thou canste make me clean.
Lord (says he) I know my soreto be incurable by any physic of man, and
percase I am a man not worthy of such benefit at thy hand: but yet
nevertheless this one point am I fully persuaded in, that thou art hable to
make me clean of all my disease, if it were thy pleasure. Thou haste heard the
faithful trust that I have of thy power: there restethe no more, but that thy
goodness be judge, whether it will vouchesalue to extend his mercy to such a
poor fellow as I am, plagued with extreme affliccyon, and paste r^medy of man's
cure. There could not be a fuller confidence toward the Lord, then when
the manne had already acknoweleaged his power what he could do, yet
nevertheless all the judgment whether he would dode the benefit or no, to
remitte wyllynglye unto him, who knew it to be otherwhyles expediente for us
to be plagued with the maladies and diseases of the body, and the prosperous
success of things temporal, to be nothing for our behou^e. And he
stretched furthe his hand.
But Jesus being delited with this so perfeicte confidence and feyth of the
man much to be pityed, did not only not remove him away out of his sight,
but also sets him on his feet, whereas he lay prostrate, and stretching
forth his hand, touched the lepers face, saying: Where thou requireste my
goodness, I will it so to be. And because thou dooeste openly proteste thy
self to believe my power, be thou clean. And even with the word speaking,
the leprye where with he had long time been full al over and over, went clean
away from al his body.

The discyples in the mean while learn a lesson how that in no wise they
ought to turn away their faces from any person being entangled with never
so enormeous and detestable sins, so, that the party acknoweleageyng his
disease, earnestely desire remedy at the goodness of Christ with perfect
trust to receive health. For if the Lord, (who only and none but he, was
pure from all manier leprye of viciousness,) vouchsalued with his own hands
to touch a creature that was to be abhorred of all folks: how much less
conuenienteis it, that the disciples, whom the Lords only goodness has made
clean from their sin, and which neither be altogether clean from all
offenses, and not out of possibilytie to fall into all enormities, should
think foul to bestow their diligente cure in healing the diseases of others?
Such ^^nier touching does not defyle the toucher, but scoureth and cleanses
the party that is touched. The party that is touched is furthewith made pure,
and he nothing the less pure that touches him, at lestewyse if by the
instrument of a true Apostles hands, Jesus self does vouchesalue to touch
him.

And now, because the law remitteth the judgment to discern which is a
l^prie, and which not, not unto all persons at adventure, but to the priests
only: the Lord would not have this miracle bruited abroad by the rumoure of
the vulgar people only: And he charged him that he should tell no man.
but to the entente that the truethe of the matter might the more certaynely be
known, he gave a straight charge unto the party that was healed, not byandby
to noise abroad the benefit which he had received, but first and
foremoste, according to the plain order of the law, to resort unto the
priest, by whose judgment he had before be condemned of lepry, and disseuered
from coumpaniyng with other folks, that if he (says Jesus) when he has
vewed thy body, shall give sentence and judgment that thou art a clean
manne in very deed, Leut. xiii. a And offer for thy clensing. etc.
than go and offer the thing that Moses law appoynteth to be offered of all
such as have had the fortune to be rid from the leprie. And so shall it
all under one come to pass, that neither the priests may find fault that
their gains does decreace unto them through me, nor the law to have been
broken or contemned, which I am come not to abolishe but to make perfect: nor
on the othersyde slaundreouslye reprove this benefit of mine, either by
deniyng that ever thou were a lepre, or else by iudgeyng that thou have not been
made whole. For the thing self shall even at the first word fully answer
them: if it so be that he was not full of leprie, why did ye, which take upon
you the skilfulnesse of determynyng which is a leprie, give sentence that he
was a lepre, and thereupon disseuer him from being conuersaunt with others? And
on the othersyde in case he be not whole, why have ye received the oblacion in
the law appointed and limited, as of one being made clean from the leprie?
The Lord Jesus did for this consideracion with so much circumstaunces
command all thissame to be done, that it might be manifestelye apparente
unto all creatures, that there was one come greater then the law: who was
hable without any help of the law, by mere touching only, and by his only
voice, and with a beck of his head alone, at his own will and pleasure, to
give perfect clenesse: and that did so take away the vnclenesse of all
^olkes which would offer themselfes through feyth to be healed, as himself
was not stained by the infeccion of any creature: and the which moreover did
freely help all folks, whereas the priests did not without a reward of a
certain offreing, somuche as pronounce their sentence concerning purity or
clenesse of the body, restored to any person. For the priests of Moses
institucion neither did send the leprye into any body, nor took it away
from any body: but of the leprye either breded in a body, orels taken away
they did judge only: but only Jesus takes away all kind of diseases from
all creatures, exactyng or requiryng none other sacrifice of them, but a plain
and a pure trust in him that we acknoweleage in him the virtue and power of
the godhed, by which he is hable to do whatsoever his will is: and that we
wurshyp in him his goodness not possible to be expressed in words, and also
his mercy by which he would feign have all sinners to be saved, paying of
his own body all that ever was to be offered in sacrifice for the sins of
them all. And that the Lord Jesus gave a great charge to the party that was
made clean, that he should make no words nor no talkyng to any body what had
happened, whereas he knew yt the fellow would not keep it unspoken, he did
therein but ordeyne an exaumple for his disciples, not to hunte or seek for
any blastes of vayneglorie for their well doings among men. For it is none
of ours that God works by us: nor it shall not be conueniente that we
require any praise to be as a reward for such things: but we shall with still
noise declare our selfs to rejoice in the behalf of our neighbor to whom
the benefit has happened: but all the glory we shall refer and give unto
God, and so little will shall we have to take any part thereof unto our^ own
land or glory, that as touching our own behalfes we should be much
desirous, that it might be to all men utterly unknown, that any such benefit
of God has fortuned to our neighbor we being the instruments thereof. No
nor the pattie neither that has felt a beneficial good turn, ought to
refette the thank and praise thereof unto the man, by whom he has received it:
but ought to render the thanks unto God the worker and sender of it, for that
he vouchsalueth most bounteously to give unto men such high and great
benefits through his servants, yea and glory does with better success and
luck ensue to him, that ^enneth away from it sekyng to avoid it: and much
more also to a man's honor does it come, when it is not desired nor hunted
for. For in very deed that same and none other is true glory and renoune, that
verai virtue self does purchase unto a man being utterly unwilling to have
it, and seking by all means to avoid it, and such renoune as neither the
flattery of the people does give, nor our ambicious desire does require:
but such as the party self who has well deserved it does not acknowlage,
but sincere truth that can no skylle of flattering, does of it own mere
mocion lay in his lap.

Through such manier wondrefull acts as this, the fame of Jesus was ^ayly
more and more renoumed and bruited abroad, while some report unto others the
thing that they had seen and heard: and these again (much like, as when men
deliver things by hand from one to an other,) do by talkyng sprede ferther
and ferther abroad the same that they had received of them, which reported it
first to others. Therefore there came flockyng thither on every side great
coumpaignies of people, multipliyng daily more and more, partly to here that
same piththye doctrine, yt heals all diseases of the souls, and partly that
they which were likely to fall in this or that sickness of their bodies,
might through the power of Jesus vee made whole. For the gross carnal people
does rather meruaill and take regard at those things which are to be seen
with the iye, then at such things as were not seen. They esteemed it a
mighty great matter and more then a man's act, that a pure clean skin had
been restored to a leprouse person by the only touching of Jesus, hand:
whereas it is a greater and a more godly benefyte by a great odds, that
the same Jesus has with ministering the physic of evangelical doctrine, put
clean away from men's souls, the feure of lecherous concupistence, the
dropsye of couetise, the diuelyshe spirit of ambicion, with other deadlye
pestilences of the mind. And gave him self to prayer.
But now Jesus myndyng by this his dooyng to teach us, that good works are
not to be dooen neither for braggyng or pomp of the world (as stayge plays
and open sightes are showed,) nor yet so many at ons, or so long together, till
men be cloyed with them, withdrewe himself into a place of wilderness: and
being solytarie from all resort of people, he gave himself to prayer,
wherein he rendered thanks unto God the father for the benefits, which he did
in most large and aumple wise send unto manne through his son. For of such
chaungeyng now to coumpanye of men and to preaching, and now to solitarye
contemplacion and to prayer, it follows that first if one at certain seasons
pause from dooyng benefits, it auoideth clotyng and werines in the receyuers
of them, and renews a freashe appetite to desire more: and secoundarily that
whosoever has sequestered himself from men to talkyng with God, returns better,
and also more hertye and cherefull to his office that he has for a time rested
from. And as for the Lord Jesus, he did in such wise temper and order all his
whole life: that myndyng to show us a pattern how to live, he would
oftentimes show himself to be manne: and oftentimes again, he would show
very plain tokens of his godhed. And truly nothing does better make a
teacher of the gospel hartye, quick, and freashe to the office of preaching,
nothing does so well sense him, and arm him against all corrupcion of this
life, as does often going from al coumpany of men into places solitary, not
to ydlenes, not to gamyng, or to other sensual pleasures, (of which sort the
reposyng of the rich cobbes of this world when they sequestre themselfes from
the resort of men for the most part ar^:) but to the readyng of holy
scripture books, to pure prayer; to thanks giving to the contemplacion of
things heavenly, and finally to the perfeict clensyng, of the soul, if
percase any spotte have been caughte through living in coumpany with ye
people. Of these things had Christ on his own behalf no manier need at al, but
his mind was to express in himself a pattern for us to follow. Daily
conversation of ye pastoure or curate among the people, does oftentimes bread
contempt that he is not regarded: and on the otherside little good it is that
such an one can do, as continually absenteth himself from all men's
coumpanies. A right teacher of the gospel therefore shall show his head
abroad, as often as the people shall need the food of evangelical doctrine,
and as often as diseases of the soul growyng sore upon them, do require the
help of one to cure them. Again as soon as they have been well fed, and
after that help has been done to the evils of a great mayny, than, lest on
the one side familyaritye may engendre contempt, or on the othersyde to much
presence may be a clotyng to them: let him sequestre himself into his solitary
closette, to the end that, from his holy study at his book, (as from veraye
talkyng with God,) he may return again to helping of his neighbors, at every
one time greater man then at an other, and all times better man, then he was
before.

After the like sort veraylye as is before expressed, did the Lord Jesus
return again from wilderness to Capernaum, and restored his presence to the
desires of all the people being now made sharp and eager with sore longyng
for him. And there, even as he was sittyng in a certain private house and
teaching, (for wheresoever Christ teach^th sittyng, there is the church:)
there had come swarmyng thither not now the basse and the inferior sort of
people only, but also the Phariseis swellyng in pride under pretense and cloak
of holiness, and also the doctors of Moses law, who being much moved with
the fame of Jesus, had purposely come thither from far places, not only
out of all the towns of Galile where Capernaum stood, and of Iewry which
lay next adioynaunte unto the same Galile: but also out of the very city of
Jerusalem, which Jerusalem did presumpteously take upon it self the
higheste preemynence of all godly perfeccion, Which were come out of all the
towns of Galile.
and also of wisdom. But as for Jesus, forasmuch as he was the fountain of
all health, did altogether from top to tooe, send out from him nothing, but
a certain effectual godly power for the healyng of man, which thing to do
was the only cause of his coming into this world. And the more principal
part of man, did of good congruence take the place to be cured first. With
his words he healed diseases of their souls. And therefore first he taught,
and the same he did sittyng down, like one that took upon him (as of just
cause he might,) the full authority of a doctor and teacher. The puttyng away
of diseases of the body, was yet remaynyng next to be doon^, the which
euryng of the body, (because it was a thing open to the iyes of them all,)
might frame in them a perfeicte belief of such things, as with more fruit
and power also, (though not althyng so apparente to the iye,) were wrought and
done in the souls. And behold a matter even there ready prepared, whereupon
to exercise and show his godly power. There was even presence a man
possessed with the disease of the paulsey l^yng bedred not hab^e to stiere, and
he was carried thither of fowe^ men. So soore was this disease upon him, that
all the senewes in every part^ of the whole body were taken withal, and so
holden, that the pieteous creature could do nothing but lie still in his
bed, and was none otherwise carried about but as a corpse or a dead carkesse.
Albeit the veraye nature and kind of this disease besides forth of it self is
such: that the Phisicians at most times have but homelye speed and luck in
wrastlyng with it. But they that carried the sick man had ^o great belief
and confidence in Jesus: that they put no manier doubt, but that the same Jesus
to whom they knew that there was no kind of disease incurable) as soon as he
should behold the pieteous sight and facion of this strange plague, would be
moved with compassion and help immediately. All the most ado was like to be,
how the pieteous creature might come to be in the sight of Jesus. For such an
one is now already at a very nigh point to be made perfectely whole, who has
once forsaken the lurckyng corners of sinnyng, and as a man in miserable state
does offer himself to the sight of Jesus, acknowelageyng his own extreme
distress, and lookyng for Jesus most merciable goodness. But as touching
this diseased man, th^let why they brought him not in to lay him at Jesus
feet, was the thick press of people, which is a common set to many, And
when they could not find. etc.
that would else make haste to salvation: Nevertheless thatsame point here in
this matter, although it stopped and hyndred the sick man's gettyng into Jesus,
yet did it make both the great desirefulnes and also the trust and confidence,
as well of the party that had the paulseye, as also of the others that carried
him, to be the more famouslye known. For although God is of his nature
propence and ready to show mercy unto all creatures: yet does he many times
make some delay of his beneficial goodness, to the intent he may the more
sharpen our desires, and also to teach us, that we ought to leave nothing
unattempted, or unassayed, that we may be delivered from the diseases of the
soul. He loves in this behalf to see us impo^tune: and by our importunitye
he is (as ye would say) compelled of force unto the same thing, which
nevertheless of his veraye own nature he is most inclined to do. Therefore
mark me now: what a bold and auenturous part these carriers of the sick man
played: or rather what the party that had the disease, with much importunity
made them parforce to do. Up they got their heavy carriage to the house
roufe in the out side, and the tilyng pulled away, they let down the sick
man with cords, as it had been in at a windoore, even as he was liyng still
in his bed, among the thickest of all the people, directelye before the feet
of Jesus. What a more shameless or saucy pranke could there be, then to
take down the tilyng of an other man's house, and to tumble in such a
lothelye sight before such a presence to behold it? And here the thick
press, which at the door would not give way to the pieteous body to come
in, could not choose but of force to make room for him when he came sliding
down from the house top. And what does the most ientill and mylde
phisician therewhyle?

He casts not them in the teeth with their shameless facion and their
importunity, And when he saw (...). etc.
he makes no tailyng nor bitter chidyng that his preaching was interrupted
with a sight much to be lothed and abhorred. The bearers of the sick body
lookyng down from the house top asked nothing of him, the manne self that
had the paulsey, asked nothing neither, from whom the great disease had taken
away the use of his toungue also. And yet all the more did he speak to this
merciful phisician in that he could not speak at all, nor, had no power
thereto. Neither was there any need of making peticion, for the miserable sight
it self did in most earneste wise make request for mercy: and the thing that
his bearers had dooen, did euidentely enoughe declare what their trust was to
have at the Lords hands: Jesus therefore when he had throughlye perceived
and seen their woondrefull affiaunce in him, did accomplish more unto them,
then they looked for. The sum of their hertes desire was no more but that the
party which had the paulsey, might be delivered of the sickness of his body,
But Jesus declaring it to be a more godly thing for him to do, and a thing
more to be desired and sought for on our behalf, to be delivered from the
diseases of the soul, turned himself to the sick man, and said. Thou man,
thy sins are forgeuen thee.

This word, because it plainly souned of a certain power perteynyng to the
godhed, did throughlye move the minds of the Scribes, and Phariseis, being
men never vnreadye or undisposed to forge matters of crime against him. For
the priests (whose office was to offer the sacrifices for sins,) did not
their own selves remitte sins, but only made intercession to God by means
of prayer, that he would forgive offenses trespaced against him. But Jesus
without burnt sacrifices such as the priests did offer, and without
prayers, as it had been of his own propre authority, and an authority of
perpetual continuau^ce, says: Thy sins are forgeuen thee: comprehendyng
under a general name, the su^me and the corpse of all sins together in
general, whereas the priests did procure no more but certain offenses to be
pourged by mean of sacrifice, and not all sins universally.

Esaias had thus much taught them, that only God it was, who might give
remission of sins unto men. For in this manier speaks he by the mouth of
his said prophet. I it is, even veraye I it is, that do wype away thy
iniquities for mine own sake, and I shall no more bear thy sins in
remembrance. But the Scribes and Phariseis, though they espied and saw in
him plain tokens of the power of God, Esai. xlii.d and.xliiii.^
yet being offended with the infirmytye of his body when they saw it, and
partly also being with envy, had more will to forge some slaundre against
him, then to believe on him. For with secret thoughts thus did they speak
within theimselfes: and (as the propertye of Pharisaicall diuisyng of slaundres
is,) unto their most deuilishe wickedness, they pretend a cloak of high
devotion toward God, and the earneste zele of tendreyng his glory.

For there is not any more pernicious a kind of ungodliness, then so to do.
What fellow is thissame here, say they, that speaks words of blasphemye,
presumyng on him the thing that is appropriate unto God alone? For who is of
power to remitte sins, What fellow is this that speaks blasphemy. etc.
but only God? But than the Lord Jesus, to declare yt in this behalf also he
had an equality of the divine nature: made answer in this manier to the
secret thynkinges of their hearts. Wherefore have ye such thoughts in your
hearts? whether of these two do ye judge more easy, either to say to a man
that is cloggued with sin, thy sins are forgeuen thee, or else to say unto
this party, whom ye see here to have every ioynte of his body vnknitte and
looce one from an other with the paulseye, arise and walk? That if ye shall
see perfeicte health of the body to be restored with a mere word unto a
man being of himself paste all remedy and cure: than believe ye that the
soul also is with like easiness restored to his perfeict health. By this that
ye euidentelye see with your iyes, believe ye the thing that can not be seen
with iyes. But th ye may know. etc.
Let not the infirmity of this body of mine offend you: but of the veraye
acts that ye see dooen, acknoweleage ye the power of my godhed. And take ye
now therefore a visible lesson to learn by, that the son of man has in
him a perpetual power and appropriate unto him on earth to give full
remission of sins unto all creatures, which with sincere feythe do seek
and ask his help: and therewithal (the said Scrybes and Phariseis geuyng
good ear unto him, and earnestelye herkenyng,) he said to the party that had
the paulseye. To the I say, arise, take up thy bed, and go home to thy
house. And even immediately the man that had been so vexed with the paulsye, as
soon as he was bidden, arises in syghte of all the presence: and taking upon
his shoulders the bed in which he had lien sick, went away on his feet
home to his own house, the perfeicte strength of his body in such wise
received again, Praising God.
that where before lying sick in his bed, he was carried with four men, he
was now strong enough to carrye his own bed himself too. And away he goes
a perfeict whole man altogether both in soul and body, leapyng in his heart
for joy and cherefull in countenance, glorifiyng God by whose goodness he
had been restored to his health, whereas at the hands of man there had been
no hope of any recovery. And were filled with fear.
And truly the people being earnestely moved with the strange sight that they
had seen, were right greatly astouned, and many of them praised God, that he
had given such great power unto man: (for as yet they demed none other ferther
thing of Jesus.)

But some of them knowing themselfes sinful and naught in their own
conscience, were throughlye taken with a great fear too, forasmuch as they
did not yet understand that Christ was come of veraye purpose, not to cast
away ne to lose such as had offended, but to make them pure and innocente.
And they said among themselfes: we have this day seen things to be woondred
at: and such things as neither we have heard at any time to have been done,
nor yet have read of. The people meruaileth and is in fear, (and even that same
is a good large step of forwardness toward health: but the Phariseis, they
grunte and murmour, and have envy at him.

And Jesus when he was gone out from thence, after that he had preached by the
waters side, (teaching us thereby, that the seed of the euangelical doctrine
is in all places without excepcion to be sowed:) as he was passing by, he
cast his iye upon a certain publicane called Matthewe, and otherwise also
called by the name of Leuy, the son of Ilpheus: and this Leuy was sittyng at
the receipte of custom. This was not a thing dooen by blind chance, but to
have cast his iye on him, was no less then to have chosen him to be one of
his. And a publicane he chose into the fellowship or brotherhood of his Apostles
of very purpose, And saw a Publicane called Leuy
to reach his servants, that no sort of men is to be rejected from the
profession of the gospel, so that they forsake the trade of their former
naughty life, and yield themselves wholly to perfect godliness. Jesus said
therefore unto Leuy: Follow me. And he at the voice of Jesus, as though it
had been one by some strong charmyng or enchauntemente clean changed into an
other manier of man, arises up, and all things leafte alone behind him, even
as he was, he followed the Lord: Now, to convert a man wholye given before to
a slaundreous trade of gettyng all his gaynes, and enwrapped with manifold
affairs such as it is uneath possible to get out of, to convert such an
one soodainlye to a clean contrary trade, this was a miracle much more
notable, then to restore the sinews to a man that had lye^ sick of the
paulsey. And that veraye point was even now already a great heart burning
to the Phariseis, that Jesus utterly refusing them, took unto him
publicanes, by whose company or having to do with them, the Jews thought
themselfes to be defiled and made unclean. But there came an other thing
besides this, which caused their envy and grutche to braste furthe. For
Matthewe being now become a disciple of Christ's, ordained for his master a
great feast at home at his own house. And thither did Christ vouchsalue to
come accompanied with his disciples. At the same time were bydden and called
also to the said feast a great noumber of Publicanes, whom Matthewe even as
he had had them companions of his former trade: And Leuy made a great feast.
so was he now desirous and feign to have had folowers of his new trade in
cummyng to Christ. The Scribes and the Phariseis this seeing, could now no
longe^ keep in the wicked murmoure of their hertes, and yet durst they not
presume to speak to the Lord: but they speak to the disciples, and to the
disciples they find matters of cauillacio^ against their master, to the
intent to turn their minds from him that they might forsake him. And this was
their saying to the disciples: forasmuch as it besemeth the holy to be
conuersaunte and to keep coumpaigny with the holy, wherefore do ye both
admit Publicanes and sinners, which are in open slau^dre and obloquie of the
world, to have talk with you: and also eat and drink familiarely with the
same in their houses, and do not abhor to have their table and youres al
one, for a special token of right dear friendship with them? But Jesus well
understanding what end and purpose this diuelishe murmouring of the Phariseis
was spoken for, made answer unto them in his disciples behalf. Wherefore do
ye falsely turn it to my slau^dre (says Jesus) that I have conversation with
publicanes and sinners? Naie veraily it besemeth me with no persons sooner to
keep coumpaigny, They that are wholenede not ye phisicia^. etc.
then with sinners. For among whom does it more become a phisician to be
conuersaunte, then among the sick? I am come for none other purpose, but to
cure souls that are oppressed and bound with the diseases of sin. And more
apt to be cured are such persons as these, being openly known sinners,
acknowelagyng their disease, and therefore calling for the phisician: then
others that think themselfes whole men, showing a poincted shieth to the iyes
of the world, under the counterfeicte pretense of righteousness, whereas
within forth they are vexed with more grievous eiuels, and have diseases a
great deal more incurable then they, whose sickness is open to be
perceived. Forasmuch therefore as I am a phisician: it is not mete, that men
being (as they think themselfes) righteous, should take indignacio^ at me, if
I keep no coumpaigny with them, seeing that whole souls have no need of a
leache. And truly such as are righteous in verai deed, ought not to have envy
or grutch at sinners endeuouryng to emende to a better life: That if they do,
than are they no less worthy to be condemned and reproved therefore, then if
one that is whole should take indignacion at a phisician visityng a sick
person to help him in his sickness. For as concerning the cause of the
foul, he is no whole man himself, ye enuieth health unto an other being
sick: and himself is not vnholden with a disease, that when he may, does not
release his neighbor of his sickness. With thissame answer so ientle and
so well to be allowed, the Lord Jesus both played the part of an advocate
for his disciples, (who were not as yet sufficiently armed to dampe and choke
the malicious capciousnes of the Phariseis and of ye Scribes:) and also did
plainly teach the said Phariseis, that his courteous demeaning of himself
toward sinners, was mercy, and not fauouryng of unrighteousness: and
thirdelye he did with couerte words, but yet sharply, rebuke their
presumpteous taking upon them, in that they did with a great solemn
countenance despise other persons, whereas themselfes were even for this
veraye point vncurably wicked enemies of God, that they stood in their own
conceiptes upon a false and a countrefaict title of holiness.

and the bottels shall peryshe. But new wine must be put into new
bottels, and both are preserved. No man also that drinks old wine, straight
way can away with new, for he says, the old is better. But one slanderous
querell comethe on an others neck. And it first arose partly of certain that
had been disciples of John. For John where he was as a marching border between
the law that should afterward cease, and the liberty of the gospel
shortly after to arise, he gave certain tradicions which did not utterly
disagree from the Phariseis ordeinaunces: whereas Christ, who was by the
opinion of many, thought much inferior to John, did use his disciples with
more sufferaunce and tenderness, especially in such things as to bodily
obseruaunces do aparteyne: of which sort are fastes, and prayers: (for by
these two things most specially did the Phariseis purchase to theimselfes a
fame of holiness among the people.) But Christ, though in his own person he
prayed often, yet did he teach his dysciples, that praying ought to be both in
few words, and also privily in places secret: Neither did he pricisely
require any fast, yea and at certain things would he wink, in which the
prescripcions of the law did partly seem to be neglected, when he did in
the mean while after a another facion frame the^ to higher stout matters
which did more specially apparteyne to evangelical stoutnesse. For a much
more higher point of stoutness it is, from the botome of the heart to
forgive a displeasure or a wrong dooen unto us, to do good even to veraye
those that have harmed us, and to susteyn the loss of our own life for saving
of our neighbor: then to forbear eating of a little meat till it be toward
night, or to humme out a few psalms with the toungue. The Phariseis made
woonderous much high service about that that might be outwardly seen, and that
might be done by hypocrisy: neglectyng in the mean while, and ica^tyng go
such things, And they said unto him: why do the disciples of Iho^ fast? etc.
as are matters of true and perfeict virtue in deed. But these Phariseis being
fellows more shameless, then the Scribes, boldelye presumed to chop logike
even with the Lord himself, saying unto him: What is the cause, why John's
disciples do often times fast, and are a great long while together in their
prayers: and thy disciples eat and drink at their own lusts, ne are not
after the like sort seen much in prayer? I^ thou constauntly allow the
holiness of John, why dooeste thou vary from his institucion and ordeinaunce?
Unto this surmuised challenge, the Lord because it touched himself and no man
else, answered ciuillye and nothing impaciently, saying: I do not say that
praiyng and fasting are naught: but in these two things I do in the mean
time suffer my disciples to do as they lust themselves, that I may after an
other facion bring them forward to more higher matters of stoutness. In
those things which concern the body, and come somewhat nere to the
ceremonies of the law, my traynyng of them is somewhat with favor and
ientilnesse: but in such matters as perteine to the soul, it is a great way
streighter and sharper. The things that ye esteem for the highest degree of
holiness, my servants shall of their own volu^tary wills readilye do if
the case shall at any time so require. Do not ye in the mean time envy my
disciples. The ends of things shall show whethers institucion of John, or me,
shall be of more efficacy and virtue. John in his most gloriyng protested
himself, to be a friend of the bridegroomes, and not the bridegroom self. And
veraily it is not convenient, that those which do familiarly remain still about
the bridegroom, and be conuersaunt with him in the spousal chamber (where
reason would, The days will come when the bridegroom also shall be taken away.
etc.
that all things should be full of mirth and iocoundnesse) should be compelled
to abstinence from eating and drinking. They are yet but tender, and they
depend altogether on the bridegroom. And him shall they not have any long
time among them. But a time shall come, when they shall be deprived of the
spouse. And than being made more firm and stable, they shall not only of
their own accord willingly fast: but also to death and into prieson shall
they be content to go, as often as charity shall earnestelye require it.
Fasting of it self, is neither good nor ill. Therefore they that fast, only
for to fast, do no great act at all: but such as can according to mine
ordinance, set at naught the glory of this world, pass nothing on sensual
pleasures, despise riches, esteem all affeccions as things of nothing,
refreine wrath and envy, bear true loving hertes to their ill willers, say well
by them that speak evil of them, pray for such as do persecute them,
and finallye set not a penye by their life in respect of saving their
brother: such will I acknowlage as dysciples worthy and meet for me. The
presence of my fleshly body does for the season make them to be weak: but
when this body shall be taken away in such wise as they may not have me when
they would, and when they shall have diepely received the spirit of the
gospel: then shall they through their priuye gifts of grace within them, be
strong and unvanquishable. And such persons as do put all the praise of
righteousness in corporal obseruacions, because they trust in their own
weorkes, are found weak to perceive those things, which I prepayre my
servants unto: but whosoever mistrustyng their own doiynges, set al their
defense and sauegarde in the virtuous qualities of the mind, which virtuous
qualities they shall acknowelage to have received of me and no man else, such
men shall no manier aduersitee cause for to quail. John's training of his
disciples, and my breaking of mine, are of two sundry sorts, because the
mark that we shoot at, is not all like. These two, his and mine, cannot have
a full myxture made of them. For he that is wyllyng to be my disciple, must
be altogether spiritual, puttyng no manyer trust at all in things corporal,
in which the righteousness of the Phariseis does altogether consiste. And
therefore I enjoin my disciples not a whit of any such things, as have any
affinity with the carnal obseruacion of the law, lest that, in case I
should admit or suffer but even never so little, they would altogether slide
back again to the same state, that I will in any wise have them to be most
fertheste from. And the Lord Jesus, to the entente that he would show how
great diuersitye there was between John, who trained his disciples according
to the first smatche of the old law that he had been nouzeled in from his
infancye, and himself that by a much other way did break his disciples to
things of more higher perfeccion, he put forth a similitude of this sort here
following. No man puts a piece of a new garmente into an old*


There is no man (sayethe he) so folyshe that in case he were minded to patche
up a broken hole of his old cote, would be so mad to set in a piece of
new clothe cut with a payer of shiers out of a new garmente: which thing if
he should do, there were in it a double incommodity. For first and foremost he
renteth a new vesture to patche up an old: secondarilye the new clothe
standing in the old garmente, because it agrees not, will not leate the
ill-favored sight of the patching be hydden. Again there is no man so folish,
that he will put new must into old bottels to be kept: or if he do, it
will surely so come to pass, that the strength of the must boylyng and
weorkyng in them, will break the old bottels in soonder, and so shall
consequentely follow a double loss. For both the bottels shall pertshe, and
also the wine run out. What is therefore to be dooen? Leat there be no mixture
made of such things as agree not the one with the other. Leat an old garmente
be botched with old clothe, and in a new garmente, leate there not be any
piece of old clothe put in. Leate also new must be put in new bottels to
be kept: so shall it come to pass, that the bottels shall be saved whole,
and the wine too. I know how heard a thing it is, to make thissame new and
ghostely doctrine of mine, acceptable unto those, that have now a long time
been enured with the old. For uneath any thing does like any person, if it
be contrary to that, that he has long time been accustomed unto. For at once
is he offended at the first tastyng of a thing that has not been in use with
him. Therefore like as he which has long time been accustomed to drink old
wine, is not at the first assaiyng delited with new must, (for he mysseth the
taste that he would have, and says that the old was better, but he says so
for none other cause, saving only, that he has been used to the other:) so
they that have lived all their days before in the old trade of the Jews
carnal constitucions, do at the first tasting of this ghostly doctrine,
sterte back, and desire to have their other grosser things again, which they
have been used unto: that is to wete, circumcision, holy days, solemn rites
of sabbothes, difference of meats, diversity of vestures, feasts,
Jerusalem, the temple, slain sacrifices or oblacious, washynges, vows,
blind co^stitucions of the Phariseis, with other things mo, not unlike unto
these. And these premises, they not only require to have again, but also do
prefer the same, before such things as be a great deal better and more
necessary to be had, which things are, an heart circumcised from perverse
desires: a mind continually keeping holy day from all worldly or vngos^ly
appliyng it self: a breast thoroughly quieted from all troubleous vexacions or
assaults of evil passions: a spirit abhorryng from the infeccion of al
things, which stayneth or defoileth the purity of the mind: a soul environed
and besette round about with feyth, charity, humilitye, and pureness: an
heart evermore temperate and refreinyng form all euilles: a mind always
labouryng to come to his heavenly country: a soul ever being a temple and a
place of soiournyng for the holy ghost: a soul from time to time offreeyng it
self an acceptable and a pure sacrifice to God: a soul being pure and clean
from al spot of sin through the feith of the gospel: a soul clean
mortified from all things that belong to this world, and dedicatyng it self
altogether unto godly things: a mind most ready and diligent to observe such
things as the doctrine of the gospel does enjoin and require. And the
thing that it requires forsoothe is feithe, the thing that it enioyneth and
commands, is charity. And thissame is verayly the new must of my
doctrine, which must or new wine, the vessels that have been used to the old
sour turned wine of Moses law, shall not well abide: but it requires new and
pure vessels that are through the gostlye gifts of grace, strong made to
endure, and substau^ciall sure to hold.

The.vi. Chapter.

ANd behold, there ensued immediately, (as God would have it) an occasion
whereby it might be plainly made open, what thing was the new wine, and
which were the old bottels. The high and holy keeping of the sabbath day was
old wine, and charity being ever ready by all occasions to help our
neighbor, is new wine. So it happened therefore on a certain Sabbath day,
which the Jews did call a sabbath secound first, or secou^nde principal
(because that falling between two other sabbothes, it seemed to have a double
holiness, and sole^nitie, the one because it was the^de of the sabbath
aforegoyng, and the other because it was the beginning of the sabbath next to
follow) it happened that on such a sabbath day, Jesus going on his way,
passed through a field of corn. And so his disciples being (as it fortuned)
an houngred, He went through ye corn field
had pulled a few ears of the corn and also rubbed them in their hands, and
eat the grain. This was a kind of easemente that every body might and
would commonly take, if houngre were ^o sore upon them, that they must needs
eat somewhat. In which case veraily whereas the charity of the gospel
would of it own accord have given some susteynaunce unto them being
houngrie: the Phariseis being old bottels require in the^ the sower verdured
wine of the old supersticion, saying: Why do ye this gear, which it is
against al gods forbode to do on the sabbath days? Why do ye that which is
not leful to do on the sabbath days?
Here the Lord once again playing the advocate for his disciples, answered: Ye
that profess the high knowelage of the law, have ye not at lestwyse read that
poyncte; what David did in a like case, when he and all his coumpainy were an
houngrie, like as ye se my disciples here houngrie now? David would not only
have auentured in the extremity of hungre to have done that my disciples now
do: but being a man of the laitee he entered into the temple of God, nor was
any thing afearde to care the consecrate loaves, (which they called, panes
proposition it* that is to say, the loaves of proposicyon, or of showing
forth,) which, loaves to eat was by a plain ordeynaunce leefull to the
p^^^stes only, and to none other person. And yet did he not only adventure to
(...) that bread himself alone, but of the selfsame loaves he fed al his
coumpainy too, nothing moved neither with the reverence of the temple, ne with
the straight commandment of the law^, forbidding any person to do so much
as touch the said loaves, saving only the priests, yea, and that thing
might the priests selves do so long and no longer, as they remaining in the
temple, did execute and minister the sacres there. No nor the priest neither
did any thing stare or stick to deliver unto David those same holy loaves: as
one verayly which well understood, that such straight obseruaunces were not
first ordained for the destruction of men, but for their preseruacion: and
therefore to cease and lose their force, as often as any certain greatter
cause of vrgente necessity does so require. The son of man is lord also of
the sabbath day.
And when the Lord Jesus had at large declared many things concerning this
matier, at last he knit up his talk with this sentence. Take ye this for a
matier of certainty, that the son of man, who is the lord of all things,
is lord of the sabbath too. For he that was the first maker of the sabbath,
has power to abrogate the same sabbothe. And he that is come to give health
unto al creatures, is not let from his office for the reverence of the
sabbath.

There ensued shortly after, an other exaumple also, how greatly old
bottels can not abide new must of the liberty of the gospel. For it
happened, that on a certain other sabbath day, he entered into the sinagogue,
as his custom was to do, and there taught. And as for this thing, the
Phariseis could soso away withal, because it was a thing both of the common
usage, and also of the prescripcion of the law. But there was present in the
same place among many more, a certain miserable creature much to be pietied,
carriyng about with him all dried up and clean maimed, the same hand, with
the help and labor whereof, he had been wont to find both himself and his
children* in such wise as it had been better not to have had the hand, than to
be laden with the bearing of it, when it was dead. And all the while the Scribes
and Phariseis, whose part and duty it had been to have taken compassyon on
the man, and to have spoken unto Jesus for the healing of him, said never a
word, but stood watching of him, whether he would restore the fellows hand,
whole again unto him: for they knew the mercyfulnesse of the lord every where
ready to help all creatures. And thereof sought they an occasion to surmuise
some false matter against him of breaking the holy sabbath, if he had on such a
day restored unto this woeful creature his hand again, on which sabbath the
law had forbidden to do any work or labor. But Jesus not unknowing what
mattier the Scribes and Phariseis did think and cast within themselfes,
speaks unto the man that had the dead same hand, and to the entente that he
might plainly be seen of all the coumpaignye, he commanded him to arise and
to come forth into the mids of all the people there. whether is it lawful
on the sabbath days to do good or eiuil? etc.
But the party, that ye may at the first word perceive that he was one
woorthye the benefit of Jesus dooyng, as an obediente person arose: (...)
sight of all the presence stood even still, showing out there before them all
the syghte of his extreme missehap. Here Jesus turnyng himself to the Scribes
and Phariseis, did not discover the maliciouse imaginacions of the same unto
the people, but by demanding a question touched and hit their conscience
thoroughly home, saying: I would with all my heart learn of you that profess
the knowlage of the law, whether it be leefull to help the neighbor with
dooyng him a good turn on the sabbath day: or else to leave the neighbor
destitute of succor in his woe and distress, who^e a man is able to help?
And whether is it lawful to save a man's life on the sabbath day, or else to
cast away the same? For he plainly casts away an other man's life, that
when it lies in his power to save it, does not save it. And when the lord
had cast his iyes round about, and no man there was, that would make any
answer he said unto the man, hold forth thy hand. And immediately he
stretched forth his hand at liberty, which before was lame, and shrounken
together, and in such case that it could not stiere a whit. So great was the
virtue and power of Jesus bidding him to stretche it forth. What should the
Scribes and Phariseis in this case do? The miracle was more euidente, then
that it could be denied: and very common reason did allow, that a godly
thing it was at any manyer time to help to the preseruacion of men: but having
been long accustomed to the old soureswig of Moses law, they could not away
with the must of evangelical charity. Whereas of these acts their duty had
been to acknowlage the power of the Godhead, and to acknowlage the autour and
first maker of the law: they are turned into stark staring madness. And now
even out of hand, they enter a consayll among themselves of commyttyng murder,
what way they might destruie Jesus and bring him to his death. This was with
those ioyly captains of religion a thing lawful to do on the sabbath day,
whereas to the same it was a mattier of conscience to give health to a man being
in extreme misery on the Sabbath day.

The lord Jesus eftesons departing from the cities and from the great resort
of people, sequestered himself, and went unto a mountain to pray and all the
same night did he pass over in devoutly praying unto god: teaching us a lesson
thereby, in case we shall be willing to begin any thing, which we would
feign have to be luckie and prosperouse in the proceeding of it that we than
begin of making our earneste prayer, that it may please God handesomelye and
favorably to send the good aid of his spirit unto the things that we go
about to enter. And when it was broad day light, he called unto him his
disciples, whom he had now as perpetual companyons and witnesses of those
things which he wrought. Out of them he pieked out a certain nou^ber of
special persons, whom for this only co^sideracio^ he named apostles, because
he intended to send them abroad shortelye after as ambassadoures of the gospel
throughout all the world, and their office to be nothing else to do, but what
they had in commission from him. The names of the said Apostles are these,
first Simon, who afterward had his name given him in the Sirians tongue, and
was called Cephas, in Greek petros, in Latin saxum, in Englysh a stone: (and
for none other cause verayly, but for his sound and constant profession, by the
which, wha^ the people were in a wavering and ma^mering what he was, Peter
being as the voice of all thapostles together, pronounced the sentence, that
Jesus was ye son of the living god.) Unto Peter was Andrew his own brother
associate as a fellow. Then James and John: Philip and Bartholemewe: Mathewe
and Thomas: James the son of Alphei, and Simon surnamed zelotes: Judas, the
son of James, and Judas Iscariothe who afterward betrayed Jesus, whom Jesus
chose not unadvisedly, as one that wist not what he did, but by prouydence, to
the entente that he would by exaumple of this Judas, teach all creatures,
what an horrible mattier it is, to abuse the favorable goodness of our
salueour toward us. Yea, and in all the whole noumber of the Apostles was
there not so much as any one, that was a man either of power, or of richesse,
or of learning, not one that was either a Pharisee, or a Scribe, or a bishop.
He pieked them out unlearned and raw or grene in cunning every one of them,
to the end and purpose, that he might pour new wine into new bottels

These Apostles thus chosen unto him, he came down from the mountain until he
were come into a certain plain that was able to receive a great multitude of
people. For such things as require purytie of most perfeccion, are to be
dooen in the mountain. Among things of most high perfeccion, devout prayer
has the first place: the next place has the special chosing out of them,
Which came to hear him. etc.
to whom the despensacion and stewarding of gods word is to be committed.
There were present also the residue of his disciples, and a veraye great
noumber of all sorts of the people besides, which had come thither out of all
Iewry, yea, and from Jerusalem self too, and also from the cities of Tyrus
and Sydon lying on the sea coast: For the hounger of hearing the gospel
preached, had drawn thither many folks even out of far parties, and many
the hope to receive bodily health had semblably allured. For every one that
came, Jesus delivered from all kinds of diseases or impedymentes that they
were holden with. Yea and they also which were vexed of unclean spirits,
were made whole. And all this gear was done of him so lightly and so easily,
that some with a mere word of bidding were restored to their health, and
others he healed in a moment suddenly, with the only touching of his garmente
that he ware. For there was in him the fountayn and fullness of the effectual
virtue and power of God, which proceeded from him, none otherwise then light
does from the son, or heat from the fire: and so brought he health unto all
persons: for a salueoure he was, and was come into the world, for the
perfeict healyng of all creatures.

Than immediately upon this he begoonne to show forth some new must of the
doctrine of the gospel, Blissed be ye poor.
whereunto he had specially chosen out a certain number of a sum what more
steadfast and sure sort, as new bottels to receive and hold it. Blissed are ye
(says Jesus) that have no spice of proud heart, but rather do mislike your
selfs. For although to the worldward ye seem to be persons abject and to be
refused of all companies: yet is the kingdom of god youres, which is by a
great odds higher in honor and royalty, than all the kingdoms of this
world. Ye see diseases to be drieuen away, devils to flee out of men, sins to
be clean abolished. What has any regal estate of this world to be compared
with this heavenly highness? Is it not a kingdom of high regalitie, to be
thrall to no vice, to be cloggued with no inordinate desires, to have trodden
under feet the deiuill and all his army, to have ouercomed the world withal
the terrors, and also the flattering enticementes belonging to the same, to be
men called and taken to the familiarity, and very brotherhood of God, and to
be registered among the inheritours of the kingdom of heaven?

Blissed are ye, who being now men in poverty and penury, do live in houngre
and thirste, and being contented with spare repastes, do despise the richesse
and the excessive fare of this world, and the hounger that ye have is for
meat of the soul, which is the word of god, and your thirste is for the
lively water of the spirit of the ghospel: for ye shall be assured to be
sacyated and filled with these restoratiue delicates which ye are so feign to
have.

Blissed are ye, which have of your own minds and wills exempted and
deprived your selfs of all sensual voluptuousness of this world, for the
earnest rendreing of evangelical devotion: and set more by such things as
by mean of temporal affliccions enduryng but a while, do bring men unto the
joys of life everlasting. For the time shall come, when all things being
clean changed to a contrary course, your sorrow shall be turned into joy, and
your mournyng into laughter.

The most part of the people do call such men happy and fortunate, unto
whom the people shows tokens of high favor, and likewise them that are
auaunced to honors: and sache through glorious titles are much renoumed. But
ye on my word and warrantyse, shall be blissed, when men shall have you in
decision: when they shall cast you out of their coumpaignies as persons to be
de^ested and abhorred: when they shall speak many sore words of reproach
and vilanie against you for my sake: when the^ shall earnestly endeavor and
labor either utterly to abolishe your name and memory for ever, or else to
make it detestable unto all that shall come after, and that not for any fault
of youres, but for the hatred of the soonne of man, whose doctrine and glory
ye shall be preachers of. But do ye never the more therefore mislyke
yourselfes, but rather be ye glad when such things shall chance unto you,
and rejoice ye. For if the favor of eiuill men shall not do by you according
to your deserts, yet a plenteouse reward for your well doings abides you
in heaven. It shall not lie in the power of men to abolishe the names of you,
which be written in heaven: it shall not lie in them with their words of
reproach or despite, to appale or derken your glory, which shall for evermore
be coupled with my glory. Naie contrariewyse, the more that they shall
persecute your name and fame, so much the more shall they make it renoumed.
For to be misliked of the ungodly, is the highest praise and commendacion that
may be. Nor ye shall not be the first, that have been thus used. For excellent
virtue has evermore been hated of eiuil persons. What men of this present
time shall now do against you, the selfsame thing have their forefathers dooen
in times paste against the holy prophets, for none other respect, but
because the same Prophets according to the will of God, did not hold their
tongues from speaking the truth, which truth has to eiuil disposed persons
been evermore odiouse. By example of the said prophets shall ye comfort your
selves. For whose names they attempted utterly to abolish, the memory of
the same is now high and holy with all creatures. Yet nevertheless ye being in
assured comfort through your innocence and perfeict good living, must have no
mind ne thought to avenge your own cause. For they shall be assured not to
escape without smarte in the end, for that they shall do unto you, though for
a season they seem fortunate, and flourishing rufflers in all pleasure and
wealth of this world. For such are differred and reserved to torments which
never shall have end.

And therefore woe unto you rich cobbes, the which while ye may, do solace
and delight your minds, with the treasoures, honors, and delectable
enticementes of this world, and do not remember ne think, that it will
erelong come to pass, that this vain felicity and pleasaunce shall be taken
away from you, and after the same shall ensue woefulnesse and sorrow never to
have end.

Woe unto you, which now in this world having mind on nothing but your
bealies, play the gluttons, and take excess of all delicate meats and
drinks, more to pampre up the body in lust, then for the necessity of
nature, as though ye were borne to beastly feedyng only, and to nothing else,
and as though ye rather mayntayned your life of purpose to eat and drink,
then eat and drink to maynteyne lyfe^ and being full paunched with gorge
upon gorge, have no mind to relieve your poor brethren perishing for famyne,
as though ye were borne to feed none but your own selves, and were not bound
to relieve the necessity of your neighbor. Woe unto you, for when both these
corporal meats and drinks wherewith ye so delicately and volupteously feed
your selfs, yea and the bealie too which gourmau^deth shall be consumed, than
shall ye be houngrie and find no relief. Than shall ye wish that ye might be
so happy as to have but one of the little crummes that falls from the table
of God: than shall ye wish that ye might have but one drop of water cast
upon your tongue to cool your mouth, when ye shall lie in burning heat of
fire unquenchable. Then shall ye wyshe that ye had in this life houngred the
righteousness of God, when ye shall se the little poor ones plenteously
saciate with the abundance of al felicity and glory in heaven, whom in this
world ye accoumpted miserable: and so much the more despised, because ye saw
the^ in penury and houngre destitute of al relief and coumfort, and lacking
food and susteynaunce necessary for the body.

Woe unto you that do now make much good mirth and laughing, as folks pleased
even to your own minds with the prosperous luckinesse of things
transitory, and as men made drounken with sweet fortune: for within a little
short space; all things turned contrary: ye shall wayle and weep, and your
plesaunce that lasted but a moment, shall be turned into pain and torment for
ever to endure.

Do unto you when all men praise you: for so did their fathers to the false
propheces. Take ye no high conceyte ne pride in your selves, when the world
upon a counterfeicte likeness of being happy and fortunate, do either in
words or by any other tokens show themselves to rejoice on your behalfes, as
persons not knowing what true felicity and blissfulness is, when they highly
extolle and pra^^e tho things, which are abominably and wickedly doe^ of you,
geuyng unto deiulishe persecutyng of the truethe of the gospel, the name of
z^le toward the law, the affliccion also and slaughter of good men, they
call devour service done unto god. This same most false praise shall not deliver
you from the vengeance of god, but shall make you worthy of double grievous
punishemente, for that ye have not only not been ashamed of dooyng many
wieked deeds of mischief, For so did their fathers to the false prophets.
but also have sought laud and praise for your eiuil doings. And they that
shall praise your wicked doings, the forefathers of the same persons did in
like manier show much tokens of high favor long agone to the false
prophets that rebelled against the prophets of the lord, and utterly
stiered up as well the princes as the people to the sleaghing of the same. But
the prophets of the lord did not seek to have vengeance against their
persecutours: and yet neither have the godly lacked their condign reward,
nor the wieked shall lack their punishmente according. And ouerlate shall it
than be for such to repent their extreme heinous offenses, as at this
present do nothing regard the gener of better advertisement.

But choose them hardylye, what they are worthy to have which for good dooen
unto them, do render mischief. But unto you that give ear to my sayings,
And him that takes away thy goun. etc.
I give this new lesson and rewle, as must of the mighty strong verdure of
the gospel. Not only requite ye not an eiuill turn dooen to you with an
eiuil turn again: but also love ye your enemies, and do ye good to the^, that
do eiuill to you. For railing and reprochefull words, render ye frendely
words again, and such words as may be for the others wealth and benefit.
Pray ye for them that surmnise false accusacions against you, that through
your prayers they may be reconciled to God, and have their true crimes
clearly forgeuen, which detecte you of false crimes before men. And be ye in
any wise so far from all hertes desire to do a displeasure again for a
displeasure done to you, that in case a body give thee a blow on the one
cheke, thou rather offer forth the other cheke to be strieken too, then thou
would avenge the first. And in case any should attempt to take away thy
cloak from thy back, suffer him rather to take away thy cote too, then thou
to come into contencion for the wrong dooen unto thee. The other in this case
has had the displeasure in very deed, that did the displeasure, and
contrariewise he that to his own damage and loss of the thing has seen to
the keeping of peace and tranquillity, has had advantage and gain thereby,
and not damage. Let your earneste endeavor be to do good unto all folks,
and to hurt no body. If any other body shall do you harm, ye have God to
be a redressour and auenger thereof: If ye shall do any manne good in any
behalf, ye are sure to this present time shall now do against you, the
selfsame thing have their forefathers dooen in times paste against the holy
prophets, for none other respect, but because the same Prophets according to
the will of God, did not hold their tongues from speaking the truth, which
truth has to eiuil disposed persons been evermore odiouse. By example of the
said prophets shall ye comfort yourselues. For whose names they attempted
utterly to abolish, the memory of the same is now high and holy with all
creatures. Yet nevertheless ye being in a assured coumforte through your
innocence and perfeict good living, must have no mind ne thought to avenge
your own cause. For they shall be assured not to escape without smarte in the
end, for that they shall do unto you, though for a season they seem
fortunate, and flourishing rufflers in all pleasure and wealth of this world.
For such are differred and reserved to torments which never shall have end.

And therefore woe unto you rich cobbes, the which while ye may, do solace
and delight your minds, with the treasoures, honors, and delectable
enticementes of this world, and do not remember ne think, that it will
erelong come to pass, that this vain felicity and pleasaunce shall be taken
away from you, and after the same shall ensue woefulnesse and sorrow never to
have end.

Woe unto you, which now in this world having mind on nothing but your
bealies, play the gluttons, and take excess of all delicate meats and
drinks, more to pampre up the body in lust, then for the necessity of
nature, as though ye were borne to beastly feedyng only, and to nothing else,
and as though ye rather mayntayned your life of purpose to eat and drink,
then eat and drink to maynteyne life: and being full paunched with gorge
upon gorge, have no mind to relieve your poor brethren perishing for famyne,
as though ye were borne to feed none but your own selves, and were not bound
to relieve the necessity of your neighbor. Woe unto you, for when both these
corporal meats and drinks wherewith ye so delicately and volupteously feed
your selfs, yea and the bealie too which gourmau^deth shall be consumed, than
shall ye be houngrie and find no relief. Than shall ye wish that ye might be
so happy as to have but one of the little crummes that falls from the table
of God: than shall ye wish that ye might have but one drop of water cast
upon your tongue to cool your mouth, when ye shall lie in burning heat of
fire unquenchable. Then shall ye wyshe that ye had in this life houngred the
righteousness of God, when ye shall se the little poor ones plenteously
saciate with the abundance of al felicity and glory in heaven, whom in this
world ye accoumpted miserable: and so much the more despised, because ye saw
the^ in penury and houngre destitute of al relief and coumfort, and lacking
food and susteynaunce necessary for the body

Woe unto you that do now make much good mirth and laughing, as folks pleased
even to your own minds with the prosperous luckinesse of things
transitory, and as men made drounken with sweet fortune: for within a little
short space; all things turned contrary: ye shall wayle and weep, and your
plesaunce that lasted but a moment, shall be turned into pain and torment for
ever to endure.

Woe unto you when all men praise you: for so did their fathers to the false
prophets. Take ye no high conceyte ne pride in your selves, when the world
upon a counterfeicte likeness of being happy and fortunate, do either in
words or by any other tokens show themselves to rejoice ^n your behalfes, as
persons not knowing what true felicity and blissfulness is, when they highly
extolle and praise tho things, which are abominably and wickedly doe^ of you,
geuyng unto deiulishe persecutyng of the truethe of the gospel, the name of
z^le toward the law, the affliccion also and slaughter of good men, they
call devout service done unto god. This same most false praise shall not deliver
you from the vengeance of god, but shall make you worthy of double grievous
punishemente, for that ye have not only not been ashamed of dooyng many
wicked deeds of mischief, For so did their fathers to the false prophets.
but also have sought laud and praise for your eiuil doings. And they that
shall praise your wicked doings, the forefathers of the same persons did in
like manier show much tokens of high favor long agone to the false
prophets that rebelled against the prophets of the lord, and utterly
stiered up as well the princes as the people to the sleaghing of the same. But
the prophets of the lord did not seek to have vengeance against their
persecutours: and yet neither have the godly lacked their condign reward,
nor the wieked shall lack their punishmente according. And over late shall it
than be for such to repent their extreme heinous offenses, as at this
present do nothing regard the geuer of better advertisement.

But choose them hardylye, what they are worthy to have, which for good dooen
unto them, do render mischief. But unto you that give ear to my sayings,
And him that takes away thy goun. etc.
I give this new lesson and rewle, as must of the mighty strong verdure of
the gospel. Not only requite ye not an eiuill turn dooen to you with an
eiuil turn again: but also love ye your enemies, and do ye good to the^, that
do eiuill to you. For railing and reprochefull words, render ye frendely
words again, and such words as may be for the others wealth and benefit.
Pray ye for them that surmuise false accusacions against you, that through
your prayers they may be reconciled to God, and have their true crimes
clearly forgeuen, which detecte you of false crimes before men. And be ye in
any wise so far from all hertes desire to do a displeasure again for a
displeasure done to you, that in case a body give thee a blow on the one
cheke, thou rather offer forth the other cheke to be strieken too, then thou
would avenge the first. And in case any should attempt to take away thy
cloak from thy back, suffer him rather to take away thy cote too, then thou
to come into contencion for the wrong dooen unto thee. The other in this case
has had the displeasure in very deed, that did the displeasure, and
contrariewise he that to his own damage and loss of the thing has seen to
the keeping of peace and tranquillity, has had advantage and gain thereby,
and not damage. Let your earneste endeavor be to do good unto all folks,
and to hurt no body. If any other body shall do you harm, ye have God to
be a redressour and auenger thereof: If ye shall do any manne good in any
behalf, ye are sure to have GOD a rewarder of the same. In his hands leat the
care of al both remain. Be thou prompte and ready to give, if any body
shall desire any thing of thee: Give to every man that asks of thee.
for by such means is mutual love of one to an other purchaced, and knitte
together. That if any person take away from thee any thing of thine by fraud
or by strong hand, leatte him rather have it, then thou to come to make strife
or business for it. Better it is for one to lose his money, his house, or any
piece of his land: then for recoueryng of these things, wilfully to forsake
better. And in any wise leat all false guile be away from all your life: but
what every one would with his good will have dooen of others toward
himself, if the case should so require, the same leat him do toward his
neighbor: and what he would not with his good will have done to himself,
the same leat him not labor to do against another: For that is to love the
neighbor as one loves himself.

Every body is dear friend to himself, and does not require of himself any
reward of his love. Leat therefore the charitee and tender love toward the
neighbor also, be plainly without fraud or guile, and frank without having
iye unto men's deserts: ready to do good as often as need shall be, not for
any respect of reward to grow or come unto thee again thereby: but for this
only cause, that he is thy neighbor, although he be one that will never make
thee any eme^des for it, no nor yet accordingly do his part in loving thee
again as thou do him. As for the reward both of your love and of your
benefit, trust for it at Gods hands only. For if ye love no more nor other
but them that love you, what piece of reward will ye require at Gods hand?
And if ye do good for them which do good for you. etc.
your love is with ye love of others fully requited already. Whosoever loves
again, an other that loves him, and would not love the same unless he were
loved of him, such an one is far from euangelycall charity, the which
enbraceth as well ye enemies as the friends. And such an one as loves again,
an other that loves him, what great high act does he, or what act mete for
the high dignity of the gospel? do not they that are lovers of this world,
and otherswyse also sinners, yet nevertheless by the verai ledyng of nature
make much of one that makes much of them, and turn their face from him,
that does not his part again in mutual love toward them? And in case ye
do benefit unto those that have been beneficial to you before, what piece of
reward shall be due to you? This is no such beneficial dooyng as the
gospel requires, but it is a choppyng and chaungeyng of benefits one for an
other. For as well such as be sinners, as also far out of the way from the
high perfeccion of professyng the gospel, do by the ledyng of nature,
recompense a benefit that has been dooen them, and cry out upon
unthankfulness as a thing detestable. Not to do these things therefore, is
the shamefullest thing that may be: to do them is no matter at all of any
great praise or thank. Moreover in case ye lend money to such men, of
whom ye verily trust to receive again al your own principal that ye lent,
what act do ye worthy or seming for the lively heart of the gospel? do
not the eiuil persons enterchaungeably lend one to an other, And if ye lend
to them of whom ye hope to receive. etc.
and receive their due su^mes again? It is but a common poyncte of pleasure
doing, that every jack uses, to do an other man a commodity at a time, to
the end that the like commodity may be dooen to thee again. It is not a
pleasure of the pure sort, that is done to an other upon hope of the like
pleasure to come home again. If thy neighbor lack and desire thy help, and
requires money in the way of lone, deliver it him, yea, although there be no
hope at all that the money shall be repayed thee: but deliver it with such a
mind, that in case he repaye it not, thou canste be content he have it of
thy free gift, and not of lone. Let as well your love as also your
beneficialnesse be both frank and free. Bear ye good hertes even to such
persons also, as are ill willers to you, do ye benefits unto such, as either
will not do you benefit again, orels will requite a benefit with a shrewed
turn.

Lend also with such a mind, that although there shall never come any part
thereof to thy hands again, yet thou have a joy and delight to succoure thy
neighbor. Neither is there any daungyer, lest ye for your part shall lose your
reward. For how much the lesser reward shall be either recompensed orels
hoped for at the hands of men, so much the more plenteous and aboundaunte
reward will God repaye unto you. And ye shall be like unto the highest.
And so doing the highest will acknowlage you as his children of the right
mark: if ye shall to your powers follow his manier of goodness. For he is of
his nature so beneficial a Lord, that like great liberality he bestows, not
only upon the good, but also upon the eiuill. For unto every one does he
give life: yea and besides this, both heaven and yearthe has he fournished
with so many ornaments, so many soundry kinds of richesse* with so many
commodities for the use and service eue^ of the wieked too* provoking the eiuil
by his favorable mercifulnes, and also by his bounteouse liberality, for to
emende: and stiering up the good unto thanks giving.

This large beneficialnesse of your father, and the same to all creatures at all
times open, your duty is like kindly children, so to resemble and show in
your selves: that according to his ensaumple, as much as in you is, ye
ernestelye study by all means to do good unto all persons, as well to the
good, that they may be made better, as also to the eiuil, that by your
ientle meekness they may be provoked and stiered to honester ways. If God,
who is privy to all men's hearts, yet nevertheless of the infinyte
goodness of his nature, is so beneficial toward veraye many unworthy
creatures, in whom he perfeictly knows that his largess shall be lost and
cast away: how much more is it requisite for you to do the same, forasmuch
as it is often seasons a thing to you unknown, whether the parties that are
helped with a beneficial good turn, be woorthye or unworthy, and the end
what it may come to us uncertain? For many times it chances, that those
which at the first appearance seem naught, are good and honest: and again
that they which at this present are very naughty men in deed, do right
shortly after turn to a better mind: And true it is that every creature
shall find God such an one toward him, as he shall have showed and used
himself toward his neighbor.

Judge not, and ye shall not be judged: condemn not, and ye shall not be
condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgeuen: give and it shall be given unto
you, good measure and pressed down, and shaken together, and tunning over,
shall men give into your bosoms. For with the same measure that ye meat
withal, shall other men meat to you again. This also forsoothe that follows
is a poyncte of christian myldenesse, and also of plainness vncounterfeict,
that ye enterprete and cons^rue in the better part, all the sayings and
doings of your neighbor, as many as may be doubtefull of what mind they
are dooen. For an heart that is pure from all corrupcion, is always more
inclined to think the best, then to mistrust or deem eiuill. As for in
manifest naughtye things (of which sort are these, slanderous backebiting,
filthye talk of ri^auldie, open robbery, and aduoutrie it shall be of your
goodness to remedy and cure the faults as much as in you does lie: but the
men's selfs neither to hate, ne to take vengeance on them. Judge ye
therefore no man: so shall it come to pass, that ye shall not again be
judged youreselues. Condemn ye no man: so shall it come to pass, that ye shall
not again on your own parts be condemned. Forgive ye in case any offense
or trespace has been done against you: and God shall again on his party
forgive your sins unto you.

Give and it shall be given unto you
Be ye liberal and beneficial toward your neighbor, and the good turn
that ye do, shall return to you again with a vauntage and increase. For
there shall be poured in your lappes back again a good measure, a measure
brimfull, a measure turned and shaken together every where, that all the lap
may be full, and no corner thereof empty or void, and a measure that shall
run over the sides for fullness, although no recompense at all of the good
turn that ye have done, For with the same measure. etc
shall return to you again at the hands of men. For after the selfsame
measure with the which ye shall have measured your liberality toward your
neighbor, after the same measure shall the reward be returned home to you again
at Gods hand. If ye have been pynching and ^iggishe toward your
neighbor, of the same sort shall ye feel your reward again to be.

And to the end that the Lord Jesus would the better empriente the premises
in the hearts of his disciples, he added moreover this similitude or parable.
Can a blind manne be guide to an other that is blind? That if he assaye the
mattier, does it not come to pass that both fall into the pit? Requisyte
it is that he be pure himself from all manyer crime, which will take upon
him to lead an other the right way of innocence. How shall one teach an
other man what is to be dooen, if himself be fast entangled in error, and
be clean out of the way? But it is an hard thing (ye will say) throughlye
to endure the obstynate malice of some persons. Why are ye agrieued to endure,
that I my self do endure? Is it reason that the dyscyples state or case be
better then the state of his master? He shall be in perfeicte good case
enough, Why see thou a more in thy brothers iye? etc,
if he be made fellow to his master. And why do thou show thy self an
heavy judge, not of indifferent equity against thy neighbor, being thine
own self entangled with more grievous eiuils of vice and sin? why do
thine iyes serve thee so well to see an other bodies faults, when at thine own
manifold naughtiness thou art stark blind? why do thou espy a little
mote in the iye of thy brother, and do not considre a whole block that is
in thine own iye? And with what face majesty thou be hable to say to thy
brother: brother suffer me to take out a mo^e out of your iye, when thou see
not a whole beam that is fast in thine own? True goodness being a more
merciful judge upon others, does of a more sharper sort chastise it self:
and contrariewise, counterfeict holiness seeks to geat it self an opinion of
perfeccion by this means: if winking at the great transgression of it own
self, it do with all extreme rigor and sharpness, make an open rayllyng
upon the small light trippes of others committed only of humayne frayltee.
Thou hypocrite, cast out the beam that is in thine own iye first. etc
Do thou condemn thy brother for his meat or drink, and thine owneselfe
with all thy power art weorkyng confusion and destruccyon to thy brother?
Hear thou, O false counterfaictour of righteousenesse. If thou will be truly
righteouse in deed, first of al cast out the great beam out of thine own iye,
and than if thou shall so think good, thou shalt see all about how to take
out the little mote out of thy brothers iye. Now after a perverse kind of
judgment (as it were, setting the cart before the horses) thou flatterest and
please thy self in thine own good qualities, as though they were syngular,
and at an other man's thou makeste much tusshyng, and many excepcyons: at
thine own eiuil propertyes thou art favorable and stacke of punyshmente, at
an other man's faults all cruel and full of rigor.

Why do ye presumpteously take unto you a laud and praise of such things,
as may be indifferentely common as well to good men as to eiuill? Neither
the habit or vesture, neither meat, nor long being in prayers, nor broad
borders about the garments with holy scriptures in them, do declare a man
to be good. For a tree is esteemed, not of the leaves that it bears, but of
the fruicte, and the fruicte raketh his sape and juice of the root, which
sape or juice if it be bittur, than cannot the tree bring forth fruicte of a
sweet relice. And again if the sape be good, than cannot the tree bring forth
fruicte of any other sort, then agreeable to his sape that it is fed withal.
The leaves and the rynde are sensyble to the iye and beguyle a body: but the
sape and the root are not seen. If the heart be corrupt, eiuil it is
whatsoever proceeds out from the same: if it be sincere and pure, than pure
it is also whatsoever springs thethens.

Every tree has fruicte cummyng of it, which fruicte it cannot hyde though
it would. For neither is the fig gathered of the hawethorne trees, nor of
the bryere do folks gather grapes. Good it is whatsoever a good man does,
whatsoever he eats, whatsoever habit or vesture he gooeth in, or whatsoever
he does of all such things as of themselfes are neither good nor eiuill, but
have rather a certain show and pretense of godlynes then true godliness in
verai deed. Eats a good man? well he does: eats he not? well he does: for
both do proceed from a good affeccion of the heart. Again eiuill it is
whatsoever an eiuill person does, because it procedethe from a corrupt
heart: Howsoever he be clothed, whether he fast, or whether he eat, whether
he pray, or whether he pray not. And will ye know the fruietes of an
euangelical tree, whose root the most sweet sape of faith and charity has
filled and replenished? Such an one loves all folks: he hates no creature:
he wills well even to his very enemies: so far is he from dooyng wrong to
any person, that he wishes well to them of whom he is accused and wished to
the deiuill: He prays for the long life and health of them, by whom he is
accused falsely: he earnestlye myndeth the preseruyng and saving even of those,
by whom himself is killed: he earnestly bends and applies himself to do
good to all men, looking for reward at Gods hand only: he demeth eiuill of
no person: whatsoever is indifferente to both parts, he enterpreteth and
takes to the better: he is a condemner of no man: but for his own part
remyttyng the judgment to God, he only sets his mind to do all men
good.

The wieked he suffers, to the intent that they may emende. The neighbor
strayghing out of the right way and dooyng amiss, And an eiuill man out of
the il treasure of his heart brings etc.
he lovingly warns and tells of his fault. If one trespass against him,
he forgeueth with his heart, and bears not the offense in mind. If thou
shalt any where see such fruictes as these: know thou it to be an
evangelical ir^e because it has fruicte seming for the gospel. Now take
also the marks whereby to know the fruictes of a tree whose root is infected
with the bittur sape of Pharisaicall pride, of envy, and of couetise. Such an
one wills well to no man, saving to himself only: ne loves any friends, but
for his own sake: his own glory he sets before the glory of God: of any
displeasure or wrong he will be avenged: yea and will do wrong to other of
his own offer: he takes a conceypte and a pride in himself even of his
naughty doings too: the well doings of other men he will slaunderousely
reprove and find fault withal: He takes ways for his own singular
commodities with the hurt and damage of his neighbors: his words are
evermore disagreeable with his heart: He neither trusts god, ne loves his
neighbor: Of himself he makes vauntes, others he condemns and says to
be naught: he flattereth himself that he does well in all things, and upon
his brother dooyng never so li^le amiss, he is a judge without mercy.

And whereas he produces such fruictes as these, yet in leaves and ^ynde he
bears a counterfayte likeness of a good tree. He goes walking up and down
in his habit guarded or hemmed with his broad philacteries: He washes every
other while: he rests on the sabbath day: he busilye flees from talkyng
with Publicans, but he gives diligent atte^daunce on great rich widows:
toward the selie poor creature a fierce crueltyra^ne, toward the rich
cobbes a plain flatterer. He fasteth often, but that is in the face of the
world abroad: at home plays he the glutton and only serves his bealye. In
his prayers he is long and long again: the law, the temple, and God, he has
always in his mouth: but at any occasion out it brasteth that lay hidden in
the heart, in which is laid up the treasour of men's good properties, and of
their eiuil also. So than, as often as any case does earnestlye prick him,
than does that same outward show of cloked holiness vanishe away, and than
comes it forth and shows it self that has lain diepely hidden in the
botome of the heart. A wrong or a displeasure is laid in his way: he is
grieuousely reviled without deserte: he is haled into the prieson: he is
spoiled of all his goods: in these cases, does the good man out of the good
treasour of his heart, show forth goodness. For he pays not home one
displeasure with an other sorer displeasure again: but either suffers it, or
else recompenseth a displeasure dooen unto him, yea even with a beneficial
good turn. To one that reuyleth him, he answers with mylde and quyete
words again: being haled into prieson he gives thanks to God: the loss of
dignity or promocions he receives with joy. But clean contrary to all the
premises, the said Pharisaicall tree, at any occasion that is offered,
shows forth fruictes of a far contrary sort to the others.

God cannot by any means be deceived with one thing for an other, forasmuch
as he thoroughly sees the diepeste corners and the bottom of the heart within.
Neither is he any thing at all moved with the respect or regard of bodily and
outward ceremonies, which do oftentimes deceive men through the
counterfaict semblaunce of holiness. They give a man glorious payncted
words, and secretlye do their vttermoste power to bring him to open shame.
For to what purpose serves it, that ye speak to me in the way of doing me
honor, making at every other word a solemn repeating of this name lord,
lord, or master, master: when ye nothing regard those things which I
command and enjoin unto you? If ye acknowleage me for your lord and
master, than see that ye be obediente dooers of my biddinges: if ye do not
so acknoweleage me, what means that calling of Lord or master: or what
does it in me? Where the case requires obedyente and ready service, honor
due to your Lord or master must be showed forth, not in words, but in
doings. The dilygent keeping of the Lords commandments, do show who is
a feithfull servant, and not gloriouse speaking of words of honor.

After this dooen, the same that the Lord had taught by the similitude of a
good and an eiuill tree, whose fruyctes are to be esteemed of the root self
and none other: the same thing does he still beat into their heads, by the
similitude or comparison of a building, that either will give over and fall,
or will not give over to storms beatyng upon it. For truly what thing the
root is in a tree, the same thing in comparison is the foundation in a
buildyng: and what the leaves are in a tree, even the like thereof is the making
of any house, which yeldeth without forth a pleasant show to the beholders.

Whosoever cummeth to me (says Jesus) with a sincere heart and mind,
Whoso^^^^ comes ^^ne and ^eareth my sayings, and does the same. etc.
and does so hear my words, that when the case requirethe, he will show
furthe evident tokens of perfect virtue out of the treasour of his said
heart: I will show you to whom he is like. He is like to a prouydent and
circumspect buylder, that builds his house not for a vain braggue or show
only, nor to serve him for a short while and no longer: but for a firmness
and stedfastenesse to stand and endure without perishyng against any
bloustreous storm or tempeste to come. And therefore he diggeth down of a
great depth, and lays a sound and substauncial foundation upon a sure rock.
This dooen he makes the upper buyldyng. Than afterward when any fluddes arise
and beat against it, But he that hears and does not is like. etc,
or any mighty tempest of winds light upon it: neither with the swift rage of
the flud extremely roushing upon it, nor yet with the forceable vyolence of the
wyndes blousteryng against it, can such an house be overthrown or appayred,
because it stands sure upon a strong foundation. And contrarywyse, he that so
cummeth to me, that such things as I teach, in deed he hears them, but he
suffers not my precepts and good lessons to sink thoroughly down even to
the bottom of his heart, is like to a builder that has but a slender forcast,
who makes his buildinges after such a sort, as if there were no tempeste like
at anytime after to arise. And forasmuch as such an one has no care at all,
ne passes not on a substauncial foundation, but goes up with his buildinges
of a great height, for a braggue and a show only: as soon as either any
renning over of the fluddes does come, or any blustryng storm of wyndes does
arise, by and by down cummeth all that ever he has builded: and the more
statelye or royallye that he has made his building for a vain show: with so
much the greatter ruin does all the house fall down. And truly
whatsoever stands on the foundation of ceremonies, pharisaicall
constitucions, obseruacions of things outwardly belonging to the body, is an
house or buildyng undoubtedly to quail and fall as often as there shall light
upon it wrongs or displeasures, loss or damage of goods, open shames or
punyshementes of the world, deaths or any sore storm of unlucky fortune
otherwise.

The seventh Chapter.

AFter that the Lord Jesus had spoken many words of the much like sort, as
is before rehearsed, by the which he trained his discyples and the people to
set them in a trade toward the excellent high perfeccion of euangelical
philosophy: he went again to the city of Capernaum, in which city he used
much and often to be conu^rsaunte. And there eftsons befalls many a
soondrye occasyon to weorke and show miracles, to the end that the authority
of his doctrine might be confirmed and ratified with the most high
excellency of his acts and deeds. There was in the same place a certain
Ce^turion, who had at home in his house a servant, which was in such peril
and daungier of his life with the disease of the paulsey, that he was even now
at deaths door. This matier did not a little vex the heart of the Centurion,
who esteemed his bondeseruaunte not by his vile state of bondage, but by the
fidelity and trustiness that he found in him, and by the pure honesty of
his behavior, and by the same his exaumple, did also reprove the inhumanitie of
certain masters, which do commonly esteem and use their servants in no
better degree of regard, then they do their horses, or their oxen. But to
the purpose, when this Centurion had gotten knowleage that Jesus was gone into
Capernaum: he procured and made out certain ancient head men of the Jews to
make instaunt request to the Lord in their own names, that he would
vouchsalue to go unto his house to make his servant whole again. It came of
reverence and shamefastnes, (not of mistruste) that the Centurion first being
a Gentile, and secoundly a man of arms (which to be was thought an ungodly
thing,) makes suite to the Lord by mean of others, and not by himself. But
they when they were come unto Jesus, suspecting and half deming it to be a
thing like enough, that so great a benefit would not without much a do be
obtained, first for a bondeman, secoundlye for an heathen, and thirdely for a
Centurion, that is to say, a pet^captayne for a Crew of souldyers: they
entreat him with much carfulness and earneste words, saying: Sir have no
respect that he is a Gentile, that he is a man of arms, ne for that this
benefyte is asked for one that is but a bondeseruaunt under him in his Crew.
For he is soondry ways a man worthy for whom to do as good a pleasure as
this comes to.

For he is right loving and friendly to our nation, and has builded us a
Synagogue. Than Jesus because he would show that no person is vile before
him, if the same be commended and set furthe to him by feyth, went to
the same place that he was called unto. And when he was now come somewhat nere
to the house, where the party lay sick in his bed, the Centurion
perceiuyng that the Lord approached, willed his friends to go mete him: and
thus to say unto him^ Master, there is no cause why for thee, to take all
this labor of cumming hither. Thy bounteous goodness does more now, then I
durst have presumed to desire. I know thy dygnitie well enoughe, and I know
mine own self. An heathen creature I am* a Centurion I am: and all this
business that I make, is about no better a man but a bond servant. I am by
mine own judgment, a fellow unworthy, under whose houseroofe thou
should put thy head, and for this cause durst I not presume to come unto
thee my self:

For the Jews think themselves by metyng or cummyng of any of us amongst
them, to be defiled, because we are taken as men vttrely estraunged from all
true serving and wurshyppyng of God, and enwrapped with many soondry sins.
Nevertheless the great dolor of my heart, and mine exceeding great trust in
thee, has caused that I have presumed to desire and ask health for my
servant lying now in extremes: which health thou art hable with a word of
thy mouth to give. But this is to simple and basse a mattier, yea and also to
light a mattier for thee to come and do in thine own person. I conjecture
this by comparyson of mine own self. For I am a man subject to the power of
an other man, to whose commandments I am obedyente, and have other Souldyers
also under me, which do all things that I command them: so that it is not
necessary for me to go about the dooyng of all things in mine own person.
But in case there be any homely or slendre mattyer to do, I say to this
fellow: go, and he gooeth, and to an other: come hither, and he cummeth. I
say to any of my servants whom me lusts: do this, and he being
obedyente to my biddyng dooethe it. If the commandment of such an one as I
am, have so great authority, that I syttyng still, the thing that I would have
is nevertheless executed and dooen by men that are under my governance, how
much more, though thou stiere not at all shall it be dooen, if thou with a
word and nothing else, shall give such commandment, or commission to any of
thy disciples? Jesus, being delyted with this talk, because it was full of
hertie good affection toward his servant, and of a lowelye opinion of
himself, and of wonderful affyaunce toward the Lord, stayghed sodaynelye
and stood still: and showed the veraye tokens of one being in a great
marvel: not because the thing that he heard was strange unto him,
(forasmuch as he knew well enough the heart of the Centuryon before these
words were spoken:) but the purpose that he went about was, by making a
countenance of merualing, to commend unto the Jews the Centurions affiaunce
and assured trust in god: and also to embrayde the^ with their unbelief, by
this exaumple of a man being both an heathen, and a souldyer. Jesus therefore
making delay of an answer to the Centuryon, turned to the multitude of the
Jews, that accompainyed him, and said: This one thing I affirm unto you of
certainty, that yet unto this day I have not found ne known so much faith
in all the nation of Israel. For the senioures of the Jews that had come unto
him did less believe on him, in that they made such earneste desire to have
the Lords own presence there, and in that they half mystrusted that Jesus
would not have healed the servant of an heathen man, unless they had alleged
his hertie favor toward the nacyon of the Israelites, as though the Lord
were a geuer of his benefits for humain or worldly affeccions, or for the
dignity and worthiness of the person: and not much rather to the feithfull
trust of the peticioner. Jesus therefore, (after that he had affirmed unto
them that a time should come, when such as by the Jews estimacion were
reputed for heathen and for sinners, should through the commendacion of faith
be received unto the dignity of the nation of Israel, these persons rejected,
who being by natural descent the children of Abraham, had through their
unbelief made themselves unworthy such a pattern or head stock and lynage,)
said unto the Centuryon, (who at the last was come himself too:) go thy
ways: for the thing that thou have believed may be done, is done, thy
servant is perfitely whole. And as he was in returnyng homward, he had
knowelage by his servants meting him on the way, that his servant was even
at the self same time suddenly delivered from his disease, in which the lord
had said: thy servant lives. For so largely does the virtue and efficacy
of Jesus word extend, that it does with no less fruit or benefit help
persons absent, and far distau^t, then those that were present within his
sight or reach, if their faithful belefe and affiaunce in him did hable them
as apt and woorthye to receive their godly desire for their faythes sake,
especially when the exaumple was such, as might either put the Gentyles in
hope and cumfort of gods grace toward them, orels be a monicion to the
Jews, that for defaulte of the true faith, they should lose the favor of god,
which they should wilfully and obstinately reiecte and cast of when it were
offered. For certes this present exaumple was but an image or figure of the
Gentiles afterward to cum into the fellowship of the grace of the ghospel,
through pure faith, without the obseruacion of Moses law, and yet
nevertheless by the commendacion of the law after a sort. For the law was
as a nouryce or a first scholemaister and bringer up of men unto Christ, and
from the Jews did the original preaching of the gospel first proceed. And
certes for a figure of this matter and nothing else it was, that the elders of
the Jews do commend the Centurious cause, and do speak for him unto Jesus:
and the same Jews do accumpany Jesus into the Centurions house, whom they
would and did afterward drive out of their own temple.

And forsooth the Lord, to the intent that the seed of evangelical doctrine
might ferther and ferther be spread abroad, did oftentimes remove and depart
from one place to an other. And so it befell, that leaving the city of
Capernau^ he passed by the city of Naim, which lies from the mountain Thabor
much about the distaunce of two miles, toward the South coaste, not far
from Endor. And when he thither went, his disciples followed him, of whom by
this time there was a great no^bre: and besides the^ there went also a great
multitude of the common people of all sorts and degrees. And wha^ ye Lord was
now not far from the gate of the city, Behold there was ^ dead (...) carried
ou^^*
behold an occasion of an other new miracle. There came a dead corpse carried
on me^nes backs toward buri^ng with a great coumpanye of people. And a
doulful matier it was, first because it was a very young man that was dead, and
taken from his life even in the very flower of his age: secondarily, because it
was the only son of a wedowe, who being deprived of the coumforte of an
housebande, had set all the hope and stay of her life in the same her
soonne. This wedow therefore testified the woeful tormenting of her heart both
with weping tears, and also with many piteous words of lamentacion, such as
extreme raging dolor does commonly put in folks minds to speak. The great
wailyng of the wedowe, together with the unripe death of the young strieplyng,
caused the rest of the coumpanye also to weep, as many as for kyndenes and
bond of neighbourhode went following the corpse. When the Lord saw her* he
had compassion on her.
When ye Lord Jesus being mostefull of mercy and pity had seen this sight,
he took compassion on the wedowe, and showed himself an effectual comforter
unto her, that had none else to be her comforter, he help her both in words
and also in deed. Woman, says he, make no more weping. And when he had so
said, he came unto the biere whereon the dead man was carried, and put his hand
to it. And immediately they which carried the corpse stayed. Here both
coumpanies earnestly herkenyng, as well they that accoumpanyed the wedowe, as
also they that came with the Lord, And he that was dead, sat up and began
to speak.
Jesus turnyng to the young man that was dead: young man (quod he) I say unto
thee: Arise. At this word immediately ye young man, even as it had been one
newly awakened, and raised out of his sleep, sat upright on the biere, and to
the intent that it should be the more evident a token that his life was
restored him, he begoonne to speak. And this speaking did ferthermore also
declare the lustye freashenesse and heartynesse of spirit in him.

And when he had now lept down from the biere, and cleuyng fast unto Jesus by
whom he perceived that his life had been restored unto him, was still rendryng
thanks for it: the Lord delivered him unto his mother, to have him home with
her, going now on his own feet, whom she had caused after he was dead, to be
carried toward bur^yng on four men's shoulders. And thus truly was the
matier done as touching the story, but not without a significacion of ghostly
doctrine. The wedow being a mother, represe^teth the church. Forsooth even
this is the same wedow who^ the prophet Esaye does comfort, saying: Be glad
thou barain that bring not forth children, rejoice thou ye art nothing
toward bearyng, for mo are the children of the forsaken, than of her that
has an husband. The synagogue trusts altogether in her spouse Moses: it
makes great vauntes of the children of Abraham being equal in noumber to the
sand that lies on the sea shore. The church after the estimacion of the
world, seems destitute of her spouse, who has conveyed himself up into
heaven: and at the first she seemed barain, and without hope of any issue or
succession, (the Jews and also the prices of this world labouryng that al
memory of Jesus whom they supposed to be utterly destroyed and dead, might
utterly be taken away and abolished for ever.) This wedow does daily bring
forth, not children of this world, but children of the light: neither does
she bring them forth to Moses, who taught things earthly, but unto Christ,
who teaches and also promises things heavenly. She brings them forth, not
to death, but to immortality. She groneth daily in bringing forth children yet
unshapen and imperfect, until they have received ye spirit of the gospel, and
until Christ be brought to perfect shape in the^. A true mother she is, and
singularly does she love her children, who^ with great carfulness she frames
and trayneth until they may grow to full age, and may be brought up to the
strength of perfect men. For love and devotion toward god also has it
infa^cie, and it has it cumming forward in growthe of age. That if at any time
it fortune any of her children to dye, she wepeth and can not be coumforted,
nor wepeth any less for him, then if she had had none but him alone, whom she
lost. Innocence which is given through euangelical faith is life, and sin
is death. We see with how great affeccion mothers do mourn for the bodily
corpses of their children: but much more tenderly does the church weep and
waill for one that after baptism is fallen again to any deadly sin, and more
pensife she is for the death of one sinner, the^ ye Synagogue is glad of
fourscore and nynetene ryghteous. Well than, forth is the dead man borne of
four carriers: that is to say, of the inordinate desires of this world, which
having the dead corpse on their shoulders benng now destitute of the holy
ghost, lackyng now all felyng of himself, being now dead aslepe in his
ownnaughty vices, carrye him down streighte to the grave of everlasting
despair. The church ferthermore has gates, by which she casts out dead
folks, lest that with the stinkyng of the dead corpse, the others also that
are yet whole, may be infected. She has other gates also, by which to
receive in such as are called to life again of the Lord. As she brings not
forth into life, but by the spirit of Christ, so does she not receive into
life again, but whom Christ does call back again. The porters that carry the
dead, never stop ne stay until they cum even to the grave. For whosoever has made
al his restyng place here in this world, and whosoever has once let himself at
large to be led with sinful affeccions, ceasseth not with damnable proceeding
to fail continually into wurse and wurse, until he cum to ye main depth of
evils, and is delivered to his lusts abominable. And all the while, naught
does the mother but weep, yea and all the coumpanye of his cou^treimen do
weep, sorowyng that the dead is cast out, whom they wish to return to life
again. And these verilye are the prayers of our mother the church, these been
her tears, and these are the sighs and grouynges of the godly persons,
making moan and sorrow for the death of a sinner. This young strieplyng was
dead, not being yet confirmed with the spirit of the ghospel, and so much
the more worthy of mercy, because that the same man who^ they had hoped and
trusted should through ye spirit of Christ have prospered and grown foreward
unto the highest degree of euangelical godliness, him they see now past life,
and void of any spirit, and by most merciles porters to be even in carriyng
out toward the derke pit of the grave. But yet nevertheless the mother all the while follows: the folk of the town also do follow (for charity ca^
scarcely by any mean despair) and with teres, with fettyng sighs, and with
woeful lame^tacions they declare what thing they wish. But ye thing that they
wish lies not in their power to give, neither be they able to keep him still,
when life was once departed, nor yet of power to reise him up again, after he
was dead. To man's power he was dead, and past all possibility of calling again
to life. But al is welinough. At the weping teres of his church Jesus cumeth,
and meteth them: luckie and blessed at al times is ye metyng of our savior
with any body. He casts an iye on his wedowe, luckye and blessed at all times
is the merciful lords beholding of any body. He casts no iye on the dead
body, who because he thought not himself to be in any need of mercy, did not
yet seem worthy the mercy of Jesus, but ye earnest affeccion and zele of the
church does that obtain, which ye sinner being desperate and past all
grace does not so much as wish. The Lord bids the mournyng to be
ceased, bringyng them in hope of joy to follow after: he puts his hand to
the biere. The porters of the dead corpse do stand still. The first point of
hope, that one is in the way of amendyng again toward innocence, is, not to
go any ferther in naughtines. He that ceasseth to be wurse the^ he was, gives
yet sum token of hope on himself, that he will one day were better. And yet
does this not so fortune, unless Jesus vouchsafe with his mightifull hand to
touch the biere. The hand of Jesus sets an end unto all wicked desires or
appetites, that ye party shall now cease from all naughtines, which was in
cariyng to the grave. The church in deed prays, she makes great intreatyng,
she exhorts, she chydeth such persons as do offend, because she would
have them to amend and be in perfect rest from their viciousness. But all
this in vayn, unless Jesus with his secret virtue and power should touch the
soul of the sinner being dead. For Jesus is the life of every man, yea, even
of ye dead too. And good hope there is that life will cum again, when Jesus
vouchesalueth to touch ye biere: but the hertines of life does not yet
return, unless the Lord do speak unto the dead. At the voice of whom only
and none else the dead do revive again, yea, although they have been laid in
grave, yea and have lien of four days continuance there: to the intent, that
no man should think any sinners to be so far past grace, of whose
recouerye to grace again the charity of the church should despair. Lazarus
was carried out, he was buried, he lay stynkyng already in his grave, yet was
there weeping and wayliynge made for him all the while, and at the voice of
Jesus calling him, he came forth of his sepulcher. And in deed Lazarus was
with sumwhat more a do raised to life. For Jesus at that present did (as it
were) rore out in his spirit, he wept, and was sore troubled in himself: not
for that it was any harder for him to reise one that had lien four days
buried, then one whose life departed but even now out of his body: but to
show how hardely such persons cum to amendment, as have of long
continuance accustomed themselfes unto viciousnes. Jesus cast an iye on the
wedowe, and she leaft weepyng: he shall likewise cast an iye on the dead
person, and he shall begin to live. The most merciful Lord therefore
turned himself to the party that lay there dead, thou young man (quod he) I
say unto thee: Arise. He cannot choose, but revive again, to whom any words
shall be spoken out of Jesus mouth: yea, although he were dead.

For the words he speaks, are al spirit and life. What followed of all this?
He revived again to innocency, that was dead in sins: he sets himself
upright who before lay still having no felyng of himself: and (the which is
the most evident token of a mind corrected to goodness) he begins to speak,
co^fessyng his own sins, and geuyng thanks to the mercy of God. He is
restored to his mother aliues man again, and where he was before in carriyng to
his grave with great mournyng of many people, he is now with much greatter
joy of them all brought home again. For this property has true godliness,
that it loves such men much the better, which have amended from great
enormities to the ernest endeavor of ledyng a better life. For in these does
the goodness of god more better appear, And there came a fear on them all.
the^ in such as have never fallen into any grievous crime or enormitie. The
mother rejoices yt she has received her son again. And they which before
did mourn for ye corpse, do now rejoice: and not only do they rejoice, but also
every one of the^, as many as were present at this sight, were taken with a
certain fear. For such as are openly eiuill and incurable, the church
casts out of her fellowship as dead corpses: to the end that by the exaumple
of one, many may be afeard to sin. But yesame cumpany do praise and magnify
the mercy of God* by whose power the dead return to life again. A great
prophet is arise^ up among us.
For so notable a miracle seen, yesame people said: A great prophet is there
sprung up amongst us, and god has taken regard to his people. For the Jews
did as yet deem ne suppose no higher thing of Christ, but that he was sum
notable prophet. And of this act also did the fame of the Lord Jesus grow,
the brute of the matter being spread abroad not only throughout al Iewry, but
also throughout all the coasts on every side that lies about fluime Iordane,
where John had before baptized as well the other people, as also Jesus self.

Than certain of John's disciples, half enuiyng at so great success of the
things that were wrought and done by the hands of Jesus, and having a certain
spice of envy at his name, waxyng every one day more famous then other, and in
manner derkenyng the glory of John, of who^ they had an high opinion: make
relacion unto John, liyng fast bound in the prison, of all the things that
Jesus spoke and did.

John therefore of purpose to remedy and cure this affeccyonate mind of his
disciples, called two of them apart unto him, and sent the^ unto Jesus, to
demand of him this question: Are thou he that was said should cum, or else do
we look for an other? John had so often already given testimony of Christ,
and also pointyng at him with his finger, had said of him: Behold the lamb of
God: Behold him that takes away the sins of the world. And nothing is
there more contrary to al reason, then to think that so great a Prophet as
John, being now nere unto his death, should begin to doubt. For though his
body were in prison, yet was not his testymonye of Christ bound in ^haines:
neither did the derkenes of the prison any thing dim his judgment
concerning Christ. For whom he acknowlaged in his mothers womb; him did he no
lose acknowelage in the prison. But the synguler good man judged it so to be
most expedient, Go your wais and bring word again to John what ye have seen.
that he might by this way, as it were, make delivery of his disciples into the
hands of Jesus. When John's disciples therefore had dooen their message to
Christ after the same manner and form as their master had given them in
commission, the Lord Jesus did at the first make them no answer: But many
miracles done in their presence, right many sundry maladies driven out from
such as were sick, many incurable evils put away from men, unclean spirits
cast out of me^ with a word, the sight restored unto many that were blind, at
last thus he answered the^: To what purpose is it for me to give sentence of
my self, who I am? There is no testimony more clear out of doubt, then the
testimonye of a (...) acts. Go your ways and bear word unto John, what ye
have seen with your iyes, and what ye have heard with your ears. The blind
receive their sight, they that werlaine, are made hable to walk: lepres are
made clean: the deaf have their hearing restored: the dead return to life
again: the poor and low do enbrace the glad news of salvation: according
to the prophecy of Esaye, which says: He has sent me to preach the
gospel unto the poor. John preached the kingdom of heaven to be at hand.
Weigh ye with your selves whether these things which ye see, And happy is he
that is not offended in me.
be things worthy and semyng for the kingdom of heaven. And blissed is he,
that shall not turn these things which I do for the health of men, into an
occasion of slaundre to hymselfewarde. For as the greatness of the things
wrought by me, shall stiere many persons to envy against me: so shall the
weakness of this body, be occasion of slaundre to a great many. With this
saying Jesus did secretly check the envy of John's disciples, giving also
therwithall a by word of knowledge that it would so cum to pass, that the
worldly open shame of the cross, (by which in any wise the mystery of the
kingdom of heaven was to be executed and accomplished) would turn many
men's hertes a way from the doctrine of the gospel: and ferther, that
blessed should they be, who neither would bear envy ne grutche at his
glory, ne as men dismayed or troubled with the reproach of open death, would
sterte back from his wholesome doctrine.

And when John's disciples were gone their way, to report unto him the answer
of Jesus: the Lord begone largely to speak in ye praise of John, to the
intent that none of them should by reason of demaundyng the former question by
his disciples, mystrust or suspecte John himself to be any thing waueryng: or,
concerning his own testimony that he had before given of Jesus, to have now
changed his mind, and to be half in a doubt of ye same. Jesus therefore
remoueth a way from John the suspicion of inconstauncie, and also makes John's
testimony concerning him, to be of the more crede^ce and weight, in such wise
extolling John's excellent virtues, that yet nevertheless he gave him not the
title of Messiah, which title certain persons for a good long space did labor
to give unto him. And in this manner it was that Jesus spoke. What went ye out
into the wilderness for to se: A read.
If ye suspecte (says he) yt John, who a good while sens, gave testimony of
me, to be now of a waueryng mind, why than did ye a great while agon leave
the tounes after that sort, and rennefull and whole into deserte places to see
the man? to see a read (trow ye) that is blown to and fro with the wind and
never long abides steadfast? But go to yet, what went ye forth at last to
see? A man (trow ye) gaily apparelled in soft sylkes, yt he may with
deliciousnes of fare or with ambicion of honor be corrupted? But this
suspicio^ cannot light on a man, which went clothed in a camels hide, which
gyrt his loins with a roughe thong of heary leather, which lived with
grassehoppers to his meat, and with plain water to his drink, and which,
whereas he sustained his life with no fyner diete then this, did besides also
fast very often. Who^ gorgeous araie doneth best please, who^ deliciousness of
meats does delight: such do seek and make shift to be in kings courts.
And on such persons as have a great desire to the things above said, the
suspicion of a corrupt sentence and mind, of inconstancy and waueryng, or of
plain flattery may perchance light. But John has preferred wilderness before
ye courts of princes: he has preferred ye hearie hide of camels before
veluets and silks, and before garments of clothe of gold, or set with
precious stones: wild honey and locustes, has he preferred before ye
martspaines and other sweet delicates of kings: and plain water before the
sweet hypocras of the rich me^. And how that John can in no wise flatter, the
very prison that he is in, does sufficiently try. There is therefore no
cause why any man should suspecte that John did before for any man's pleasure
or favor, give so high and worthy testimony of me, and now to have changed
his mind. But yet would I fain know, what thing called you forth into
wilderness, was it (trow ye) to see a prophet? In deed he openly confessed that
he was not the Messiah, yet this one thing do I affirm unto you, if ye ran
forth into wilderness for that cause, to see a prophet, ye are not frustrate ne
deceived of the thing ye looked for. Ye have in very true deed seen a prophet,
yea and more then a prophet too. For this same is very he, of whom Esaye long
and many a day gonne did prophecy, that he should be the foregoer of
Messiah. Behold (says he) I send my messenger before thy face, which shall
prepare thy way before thee. For the prophets did by derke mystical sayings
foreshew certain things long after to cum: but this John did with his finger,
point to Messiah and show him, when he came. Therefore they that think highly
of John, do think rightly and well. For thus much I affirm unto you all:
Among all the men that are now in this time or before times hitherto have been
borne of women, there has not any prophet arisen greatter or more excellent
then John.

It is great and great enough that I do now witness of him. But the thing
that sum assygne unto him, he will not himself acknowlage ne take as due unto
him. For there is one greatter then he in virtue to do things, and also in
dignity, who nevertheless after the opinion and acceptacion of the people is
inferior to him in the kingdom of heaven. The straight living of him, and his
going into deserte out of all coumpanye, they do highly esteem, and the
familiarity of this other do they contemn. The dignity of John they have in
reverence, at the glory of this other they have envy. The doctrine of him they
did enbrace, ye doctrine of this other they slau^dre and deprave. He preached
baptism unto repentance; for he affirmed the kingdom of heaven to approach,
and to the voice of him herkened every body, as well the ignorant and inferior
people, as also Publicanes, soldiers, harlotes, making haste to the baptism
that John ministered unto the^, confessing theimselfes to be sinners, and being
desirous and fain to be washed from their si^nes. And so did they glorify the
righteousness of god, acknowlagyng their own unrighteousness, And all the
people and publicans that heard him, justified god.
forasmuch as no creature is clean from great sin saving only God, and
enbracyng the goodness of God, who has made promise that he will freely
forgive all the offenses and transgressions of the former life unto all persons
that with sincere trust and affiau^ce, will take their refuge unto him. And
contrariwise, the Pharisees, the Scribes, and the lawiers, while they reken
shame to acknowlage their own iniquity, they have rather willed to make God a
lier, the^ to enbrace the truth: and therefore thought they skorne to be
baptized of John, unto their confusion and castyng away, despysyng the
merciful counsel of God, who has appointed and determined to abolishe the
sins of all mortal people by this most easy and ientle way. For what is a
more easy thing, then to confess, and so to be diep^ in water? not for that
innocence was or might be given by John: but for that the baptism and
preaching of John did make a preparatife to the same innocence, to the end
that the more noumbre of persons might be brought to salvation through the
preaching of him, to whom John was as a forerenner and messenger, in case he
should find their hertes and minds already prepared to receive it. There was
nothing of all the premises unadvisedly doe^, or without a good ground, but the
providence of god disposed all things to ye health and salvation of mankind.
And the poor commoners, the people of most lowest sort, and sinners, who
seemed to be ferthest out of the way from true godliness, and very far short
of the knowlage of the law: such men embraced the beneficial and merciful
goodness of god. And contraryewyse they whom it behooved most of all to
understand, that these things were promised by the holy sayings of the
prophets, and who also seemed to be ye very pillours of al devout holiness,
have utterly refused the bounteous goodness of God, being offered unto them, and
have felt no manner compunccion, to repentance or amendment, neither at John's
preaching, nor yet at mine. And Jesus laiyng this obstinate malice plain in
their face, brought in a similitude of this sort in his communicacion.

What shall I than say of the people of this perverse generation, or to what
thing shall I say them to be like? We have piped to you, and ye have not
^aunced.
They may be lykened unto boys, whom we see sitting together in ye open
street, which boys aunswering one another in their plaiyng, use thus to say:
we have plased you merry songs upon our pypes, and yet have ye been thereby
nothing moved to dau^ce: we have played you mourning songs, and yet have ye
not wept. Thissame proverb being taken of the common guise of children in the
street, did the Lord Jesus apply and compare unto the obstinate Jews, who
neither with the straight living of John were moved to any fear of gods
ve^geau^ce: nor yet with ye courteous familiarity, and beneficial doings of
Christ, were any thing stirred unto the love of him. For there came John (says
Jesus) with singular streightnes of living, both preaching repentance, and
also giving an exaumple of repentance, neither eating any bread, ne drinkyng
any wine, but living in wilderness, clothed in a pilche of a Camels hyde, and
girte with a gyrdle of lether. But for all these things so far were ye from
all repentance, that the thing which was done for to emende you, The soonne of man is come and eats and drynketh.
ye turned into surmised slaundres and querels, saying. He lacks common
reason, he has a deiuil in him. The son of man is come seking by the
contrary way, to bring you to salvation: that is to wete, as a man familiar
and ready to mete or speak with all persons that would, making no show of
any new straightness of living, nor manacyng or threatenyng any punishment:
but alluryng all persons with benefits unto the love of him, eating and
drynkyng as other folks use to do, being conuersaunte among all sorts of men
whatsoever they were, nor differyng from other men either in his meat, or else
in his arye. And this man's humanity and cutteous behaueour wherewith ye
ought to have been provoked unto better ways, ye turn into an occasion of
slaundreous reprochefulnesse, saying: Behold a gluttonous fellow, a drynker of
wine, a friend of publicanes, and of sinners.

But yet nothing prevailed the malice of men against the workyng or purpose of
the wisdom of God. Wisdom is iustyfyed of all her children.
For the righteousness of God was even by that means glorified with all the
children being given to evangelical wisdom, after that it was well to be
known that nothing was leaft undone for the saving of all creatures: but yet
the evil and the proud, refusyng the free gift of God, by their own just
and true deserts to be cast of and to be condemned: and in their stead
publicanes, harlottes, sinners, and heathen, to be rightfully admitted to the
partakyng and fellowship of salvation. So was it prophesied before that be it
should, and so did it prove: So was it reason that it should come to pass,
and so came it to pass in deed. They that vaunted themselfes to be godly men
and righteous, were for their unbelief rejected and put away from the free
gift of evangelical salvation: and contrariwise, such me^ as through
promptness of beleuyng, and through vncorrupt affeccio^ have violently brast
in for to come to the Lord, were they never so secular, were they never so much
to be abhorred, were they never so much defoyled with synfulnes, have been
received to the fellowship and brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven.

And behold, there followed byanby in the neck hereof a certain matier,
wherein the case self should lay plainly before their iyes, the same that the
lord had taught in words, concerning the puttyng away of such as thought
themselves righteous, and the receiving of sinners to grace and favor. The
Pharisees far above other men were puffed up in pride: by reason of knowlage
of the law, and for the opinion that the people had of their holiness. And so
it befell that one of them prayed the Lord to take a repaste at home at his
house. Neither did Jesus disdeigne the same to do, who denied no man to have his
presence that would. And when he being entered into the Phariseis house was set
down at the table: behold a certain womanne, which within the same city was
known for a notorious sinner, as soon as she knew that the most merciful
Lord Jesus, A woman in the city which was a sinner. etc.
(who would debar no creature from coming to him, who also did most
promptely and readilye help all the eiuils of all persons) was there
present: she altogether mislykyng herself for her synnefulnesse, but yet
conceyuyng great trust and affiaunce of the merciful goodness of Jesus, did
(as ye would say) break in parforce into the Pharisees house. The ardent
desire of her heart had shaken of all shame from her, though she knew well
enough with how great stately disdeygnefulnesse, and strange countenance the
pharisaicall sort used to turn away their faces from sinners, and not once
to look upon them, whereas themself within forth swimmed as full as their
skyn might hold, of much more grievous vices. And with her she brought the
precious things of her most chief pleasure and nicitie, she brought an
Alabla^^re bore of oyntmente.
that she had yet remaining with her, as monumentes and tokens of remembrance
of her former life, (which life she now abhorred,) and upon Christ (in the
heavenly love of whom she now burned) it was her intent without making any
store thereof, ple^teously to pour it out, and in cheryshyng of him to bestow
all these precious and fine things, wherewith she had before times naughtely
served her own delicate pleasure, and had made herself amiable unto the world.
And the thing that she brought was a fine delicate little bore of sweet ointment
and savors, which vessel they called Alablastre, of a Greek term, because
of the smothenesse of it (which lets, that one may uneath take it up, and
hold it in his hands for slippyng.) But the oyntmente was specially good and
fine, and had cost a great sum of money, for so small a thing. And in old
time such as were bondeseruauntes to the sensual pleasures of the fleashe,
did very greatly delight in sweet oyntmentes and perfumes and especially in
coumpayny at any banquettynges. But see and note the holy importunity of this
woman being a sinner. She did not only ieoperde as an unbidden geaste boldly
to enter into the house of a Pharisee: but also even as she was decked and
trimmed in her array, came in boldly into the coumpaynye as they satte at the
bourde. And because the tables of the parlour stood so, that they let her
to come and cast herself down prostrate on the fore side, at the feet of
Jesus: she stood behynd at his back and (as well as she might do,) begone to
wash his feet with tears of weeping, marryng for her soul health the beauty
of her iyes, which of long time before she was wont in the way of abhominacion
to peynte with Stibie: and the feet of Jesus being well washed with tears
tryclyng down from her iyes like the drops of rain in a shower, she wyped
dry again, not with any towell of lynnen, but with the hears of her own head,
which she had until that day, customablye used for the delycate and sensual
pleasure of the fleashe, And did wipe them with the hear of her head. etc.
to enoynt with sweet perfume, to dye with colors, to kembe, and to bread
with wrythes of gold enterlaced among it. The woondrefull love also of this
woman being a sinner, was with all this not yet satisfied: but after that
Jesus feet were so washed and wyped, she leaft not kyssyng of them: But all the
things which were once the instruments of her filthy pleasures, she now
turned to the obedient service of him, who only, and none but he, is to be
loved. Thou have now the plain facion of a sinner, through insatiable
importunity of ardent love, and through steadfastness of feith, breakyng
parforce into the kingdom of heaven. Now on the other side have thou a pattern
of the Jew, who through his presumpteous conceit of himself, and his
unbelief, makes himself unworthy the merciful goodness of god, that is
offered. When the pharise which had bidde^ him. etc
The Pharisee which had desired Jesus to dinner, wha^ he saw this, whereas his
part had been to favor the woman of such a fervent good zele pressyng in,
with so great humility submitting herself to Jesus, and by so many tokens
protestyng an earnest repentance of her former life: and whereas he should have
loved the mercifulness of Jesus, who puts away no person from him, he is
moved to the slanderous misiudgyng of them both. For this did he think
within himself: This man if he were a prophet such an one as he is reputed to
be, forsooth he could not be ignorant, what woman and of what sort she were,
that thus touches him with her hands. For a common harlot she is and a woman
of notorious unchaste living, which thing if he did know, he would not suffer
himself to be defiled with the touching of a body polluted and unclean. For
the Pharisee thought holy men to be polluted if they did but so much as once
talk with a sinner. Such was the stately proud braggues of counterfayted
righteousness, thorough which the Jews stood highly in their own conceits,
incurryng the indignacion of God thereby.

But Jesus to the entente that he would so much the more declare himself to
be a Prophet, made answer unto the secret thought of the Pharisee: Simon
(quod he) I have a thing to tell thee. Than said the Pharisee: Master, say
on, what is it? Than Jesus seeing the Pharisee to give good ear unto him,
because he would not before all the coumpanye of the other geastes, ^^^nly
det^cte the ungodly thought of the Pharisee (for the part of a right gospeller
is also to see that he use civility and good courtesy too) put forth unto him
a parable of such sort as here follows. There was a certain le^der which
had two debtours.
Two certain persons ^^ once went endebted both to one usurer, of which two
debtours, the one ought five hundredth pyeces of silver coin called denaries
(which were much about the estimacion or rate of five or six pense a piece
of old sterling money, so that this man's whole debt amounted much nere about
ye su^me of twelve or fiftene pounds sterlynge or rather above: albeit sum
writers yea and must writers, do value the old denarie, much about twelve
pense ^^eol^^g, and than was the debte twentye five pounds sterlyng:) and the
other debtour ought but fiftye of such silver pieces (which was much about
the sum of five and twentye shyllynges, or thirty shyllynges, or after the
greatter estimacion it was fifty shillinges sterlyng) and for as much as
both of the^ were found unable to pay their duties, he forgave them all the
whole sums every penye, that they were indebted in. Now whether of these two
is bound the more hertilye of them both to love so liberal a creditour? Simon
not yet understanding what end this parable was meant to cum to, answered
plainly without any subtlety. In my mind (says he) that party is bound the
more earnestly to love his credytour, to whom the more sum was forgeuen.

And said unto Simon: dooest thou see this woman?
Than Jesus openyng for what purpose he had put forth this doubtful question,
said unto Simon: Thou have judged rightly: but thou applye^^ thy judgment
nothing equally ne indifferently. And forthwith he turned himself to the
woman, and spoke unto Simon: dooest thou see this woman, whom thou call a
sinner? dooest thou not see her all full of weeping, with her hear lyi^g about
her shoulders, maki^g lauasse of her precious perfumed oyntemente, lyberall and
more then liberal of her kisses geuyng to my feet, liyng prostrate before me,
and outwardly showing all the behaueour and vsyng of her body, a pattern and
lively exaumple of a repentant person? These a^e manifest tokens of a certain
excedyng great love toward me. The more ernestly that she hates her self, so
much the more frankely she tendreth me and makes of me. She came hither a
siner: but she was thoroughly made whole, as soon as she touched the physicion.

Thou despisest this woman here as a sinner, and of thine own self thou have
a good opinion and conceit that thou art a righteous man: but ye godly zele and
affeccion of this sinner, I entered in to thy house etc.
is far odds above thy righteousness. I am cum into thy house a geast
bidden to a repast and desired to cum, and yet have thou not so much as given
me water for my fete, which nevertheless had been but a ientle point of
courtesy euerywhere commonly used: but this woman has washed my fete with her
own teres, and has wyped the^ with ye hear of her head. Thou have not given
me a kiss sens I came in, which every common friend does of a customable
usage give one to an other: this woman ever se^ce she came first in at the
doors, for the immoderate zele and affeccion of her heart has not ceased
still to be kissing of my fete. Thou have not anointed my head so much as with
common oil, which point of ientlenes is commonly showed to any geastes
whatsoever they be, that cum to a repaste in any man's house: this woman has
with a precious and a very costely ointment of perfume al over and over
anointed my fete, that is to say the most abject and vile part of the body.
Do not thou weigh how much she has sinned: but consider thou how much she
loves. For dear love covers a multitude of sins. For this much I plainly
affirm unto thee, that a great noumbre of sins are forgeuen her, not because
she has much fasted, not for that she has used much prayer and
co^templacion, not because she has been a devout obseruer of many pharisaicall
co^stitucions: but because she has much loved, and because she has with all
her whole heart put her trust and confidence in me. The more grievously that she
has synnned, so much the more does she myslyke her self, and so much the
more earnestly does she love me, through whose free mercy she has been
delivered from her many fold synnes^ So has the greatness of sins turned to a
gracious and a blissed good end for her part. And on the other side, to whom
less is forgeuen: that party does not love so greatly: as for exaumple, ye
Pharyseis think your selves righteous for y^ obseruyng of the law, and not to
have any great things in you, that needs Gods pardone, and therefore your love
and affeccion is the colder toward the geuer of remission. The Lord, when he
had spoken all this to the Pharisee, said unto the woman: Thy sins are
forgeuen thee. And he said unto her: thy sins are forgeuen thee.
She had made no prayers in words, she had made no confession at all in
words, but she did much the more evidently confess herself by her doings,
and much the more effectually did she pray with her tears. And this is to
Christ the most acceptable confession of all. And with this sort of prayers
is he most soonest moved to show mercy. Happy are those tears, blissed is
that waste and loss of sweet oil, blessed are those kysses, which win of
Jesus to speak such a word, as this: Thy sins are forgeuen thee. For
Christ is not one that forgeueth some, and other some reserueth back: but he
does freely pardone all sins together, not imputyng any part at all of the
former naughty living unto any person that is penitent from the botome of the
heart.

And now mark me again the pharisaicall holiness. True godliness does as
veraily rejoice at an other bodies good chances, as at his own. But the
Phariseis that sat there altogether at the table, envying the mercifulness of
Jesus unto the womanne being oppressed with sin, begoonne with secret
thoughts to murmoure against him in their hertes, saying: what fellow is this,
which takes so much upon him, that having none other authority but his
own, he remitteth sins too, which power not one of all the prophets or
patriarchs hitherto has usurped? No nor the priests neither do take any
ferther thing unto them, then to pray for the sins of the people. But Jesus
knowing their secret thoughts, because he would the more confirm the woman's
heart, and send her home again to her house a glad woman of a sorrowful,
said unto her: Thy feith and constaunt trust in me, has saved thee: Go thy
ways in peace. And he said to the woman: thy feyth has saved thee.
The Phariseis had persuaded themselves, that sins were forgeuen through
burnt sacrifices, and through washynges. And in deed those things had in them
a certain figure of things ghostly. But the lord Jesus plainly showed unto
them, that all sins are through the feith of the gospel, full and whole
forgeuen for ever, to all such as repent and emende. And thus in these
things which we have made rehersall of, has as it were under a certain
shadow, been set forth a certain representyng of both peoples, that is to
wete, the Jews, and the Gentyles: of which two peoples, the one, that is to
say, the Jews, did with kind and loving pretense of words call and bydde
Christ unto them, crying by the space of many hundred years: Come thou o
Lord, and tarry not. But when he was come, neither, did they on their own
parties receive him as their bounden duty was to have done, because they
bear themselves bold on a false persuasion of holiness which they had
conceived in their hertes through the outewarde obseruyng of the law: and yet
morouer did they murmoure and whine against others, that were willing to embrace
salvation when it is offered.

For while they attempt and labor through the oblacion of outward bodily
things, to establyshe their own righteousness* they were not subject to the
righteousness of God, which through feyth is freely given. But the people of
the Gentiles, to whom Christ was not come (forasmuch as besides ydolatrie
which reigned in them, they were morouer altogether wedded to al kind of vices,
ne had any affiaunce in the works of the law, in which they were altogether
ignoraunte:) as soon as they had knowleage of Jesus, did (as ye might say)
forceably break in to him where he was, and through the plain simplicity of
feith, were made worthy to have remission of their grievous offenses: and did
withal possible earnest good minds, embrace and kiss the fre gift of god,
which the Jews did either set at naught, or else at least wise did coldely and
faintlye embrace. Albeit there is in this woman an exaumple of repentance
set forth unto all creatures in general, whosoever shall begin to loathe
and hate synnefull doings, that he turn not himself to Moses, or to the
Phariseis, ne unto the philosophiers: leat him make haste to Jesus only and to
none other. None there is more merciful then he: none more inclined to pardone
and to forgive. On Jesus leat him pour out that he has tofore been
accustomed wastefully to bestow on his wicked sensualitee: unto the obedient
service of Jesus, leat him consecrate al his members which to fore did serve
his filthy and abominable lusts. The touching of Jesus shall take away all
his sins. If he cannot come to touch Jesus head, leat him touch him by the
fete. There is no part of Jesus so basse, but yt it may make him whole from
al his sins. A woman there was perfeictely cured and healed from a bloody
flixe, which had no more but touched the skirtes of Jesus garmente. And Jesus
is well contented, that it be imputed to himself, whatsoever ientilnesse or
pleasure has been bestowed on the neighbors, yea ^ue^ of the most lowest
degree. He will acknowelege any benefit, that is done to any members of his.
Leate not therefore all the consideracion of a sinner be, how much he has
offended. Leat him not keep any audite or account of his well doings, as
though he would be at an even point and rekonyng with Jesus, in such sort as
the Pharisees did: But let him only with his very heart think himself to be
naught, and with all his whole breast conceive assured hope and trust on
Jesus. Leat him begin to hate, that he did once after a naughty facion love,
let him begin to love that once he wiekedly refused and cared not for. Faith
shall at the most merciful Lords hands obteigne, that merits could by no
possibility hope for. And here among al things, o most honest Theophylus,
consider me three fold soondrie persons, the first of the woman being a
sinner: the second of the Pharisee: and the third of the Judge. The Judge only
and none but he, is in veraye true deed pure from all staynyng, or filthiness
of vice and sin, or rather is the very true fountain of al purity. The
woman a sinner does nothing else but weep, wasshe, wype, kiss, and enoynte.
Here haste thou the marks to know the duties of true love and charity
toward thy neighbor. The Pharisee being pussed up in pride with the
Judicial righteousness, slaundreously blames and accuses the gracious
mercifulness of the salueour, he thinks skorne of the sinner, and also
enuieth her, himself being cloggued with much more grievous eiuill. And of
such sort for the most part, is the persuasion of righteousness, that
spryngeth of the habit or clothyng, of the choice of meats, of putting a
diversity between one day and an other of wasshynges of the body, and the
vessels which serve to eat and drink in, of long being in prayers and
meditacions, and of other like things, which have a countenance and show of
godly devotion before men, whereas in none of all these things consists
the godliness of the gospel.

And all such folks as many as put their trust and confydence in in things
of such sort as the above mentioned, both are wont folishly to stand in
high conceit of themselfes, and to think vile of their neighbors, and also
to be replete with envy, and slaunderouslye to reprove the free goodness of
almighty God. For what if that same woman had touched the Pharisee, with what
a skornful look would he have shaken her of, with what washynges would he have
pourged himself from the infeccion of her? In such sort do they despise the
miserable sinning woman: who on their own parts are sore sick of envy, of
stately pride, and of the disease of burdening men with false crimes: and are
so much the more incurable, for that in their own conceytes and opinions they
seem nothing sick at all. For many times it chances, that men sooner amend
from notorious and open vices, then from such as keep themselfes hydden under
the cloak of holiness. An aduoutrer, a drounkard, a fellow drouned in riotte,
and Idolatry, a soldier that does all as him lusts, a man may sooner
convert to good mind, than a Pharisee, an envious person, one that stands
in his own conceyt, a backebiter or a dissembler.

Now such as the master of the feast is, even such are his geastes also
being Phariseis. What a fellow is thissame (say they) that he remitteth sins?
But the judge, who alone and none but he knew all me^nes hertes, who alone of
all men might have looked alofte for his holiness, does mauerly and
courteously correct the pride of the Pharisee: he plays the attorney and
advocate for the sinner, and both assoyleth and also coumforteth her confessyng
her sinfulness. It must therefore be the part of an euangelical pastor, to
flee the exaumple of the Pharisee, and to follow the tender ientlenes of Jesus
in receiuyng sinners.

The.viii. Chapter.

FOr so great was the gracious goodness of Jesus toward sinners, were they of
never so base and low degree, He himself went thoroughoute the cities,
preaching.
that he did not only admit this woman alone unto the touching of his feet,
but he did also at sumtymes permit certain women to go all about with him
from place to place as his Apostles did, and suffered as well himself as also
his disciples to be releued with the liberality and service of the same. For
where Jesus (his twelve discyples at all assayes euerywhere following him, to
the end that the sede of evangelical doctrine might be ye more largely spread
abroad) did ever now and tha^ change places, walkyng through every city and
village: to the intent that he and his said disciples continually going about
from place to place, and earnestly attendyng to the only buisynesse of
preaching the gospel and nothing else, should not be destitute of things
necessary: there were besides forth certain holy women which followed Jesus
whersoeuer he went, and they were such as either he had delivered from unclean
spirits, or else he had healed from diseases. Among these was Marie called
Magdalene, but of who^ the Lord had cast seven devils. Ioanna ye wife of Chusa,
(who was Herodes steward) of a lady of the court becum a disciplesse unto
Christ: one Susan also, and others not a few, who bearing in mind the
benefit that they had received, did by such means as they could help the
business of the gospel forward, ministering necessaries unto Jesus and to his
disciples with their own propre goods. For Christ being a poor man himself
had chosen poor men also to his Apostles: and they chaungyng their seats or
restyng places, and going forth continually from one place to an other, so
often as they did, could not euerywhere have vytayles and all other
necessaries ready for their use and occupiyng. And as the time was than, it was
mete and conueniente that the first foundation of the doctrine of the ghospel,
should be laid by me^ of low degree, of very slender substance, and also of
no learning ne authority. Howbeit Paul (whose disciple I was and did long
time follow and attend upon him,) had more mind to labor with his own
hands, then to live at the findyng of other folks. But much more are they
that have enough of their own and are fit to preach ye gospel bound freely
to depart to their brethren with sum portion of that, yt God has sent them.
And yet this notwithstanding, he thought it to be a thing of reason and
conscience, that they which sowed the spiritual food should be relieved and
sustained, as often as need were, with aid and succor of things necessary
for the body, at the hands of such persons for whose behoufe they took
peynes. But Christ because he would teach that this lyberalytie ought not
to be of any compulsion, but of each folks own accord and voluntary will, he
admitted in deed and received certain women into his cu^pany and train, but it
were only such as of their own accord did follow: howbeit neither did he call
or send for any unto him, neither do we read that ever he craved or required
any thing of any body, because he would ye more effectuallye make sum ashamed
of their shameless fashions, for as much as where they take no peines at all
for the ghospels behoufe, yet under pretense of labouryng in the gospel, they
will by plain force and extorcion look and require to have of the people
against their wills, not only that may suffyse for necessity, but also that
is more then enough, because they will be maynteined in riot and excess. But
truly the free liberality of good people shall never fail that man which
with a sincere mind does altogether embuisye and occupy himself in preaching
the gospel. Moreover Jesus like as he did admit all persons, what ever they
were, to the helpyng forward of the gospel: so did he use not to admit
either his mother or any of his brethren and kinsfolks to hindre the
effectual procedyng of the gospel.

the way side, and it was trodden down and the fowls of the air deuouted it
up. And some fe^on stones, and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away,
because it lacked moystnesse. And some fell among thorns, and the thorns
sprang up with it and choked it. And some fell on good ground, and sprang up
and bare fruit, an hundredth fold. And as he said these things he cried: He
that has cares to hear let him hear. And on a certain day when he was goen
forth of the house unto a lakes side, by reason of the great multitude of
people which resortyng unto him to hear him, and there syttyng on the shoore
bank buisely teaching the people, so great a multitude of both men and women
out of the cities thereby, came rennyng to hear him, that the people,
gatheryng so thycke about him, he was co^streigned to go into a boat, and
therehens as it had been out of a chair or pulpite, he taught the multitude
being assembled of all sorts of people, and spoke many things unto them under
the mystical derke covert of similitudes and parables: partly that he might
the more effectually stiere up in them an earneste desire to learn: and
partly that it might the more diepely settle and rest in their minds, The
sower went out to sow his ^ede
that had been enpriented by a mystical derke color of speaking.

First therefore he put forth a similitude or parable to advertise them all
with gredie minds to receive the preaching of the gospel, and not to reakon
in sufficient to have heard it, unless they bestowed it when they had heard it
to the use and exercise of godliness. There went forth, (quod he,) a certain
housbandmanne to sow his sede, and while he does euerywhere cast his sede
abroad leauyng no place void, Sum fell by ye high way side. etc.
as one that coue^ed as much encreace as was possible: the seeds were received
in diverse and sondrye places of the ground, not being every one of eguall
fruitfulness, to bear. For some of the seeds when they were cast, fell by the
high ways side, and these seeds partly were trodden on and all to bruised with
the feet of such as went by the way: the remnaunte, because it was not
covered with earth, the birds of the air did eat up. And sum fell among
thorns.
Again some seeds fell in stony places of the soil, and being received with
thynne covert of earth which scarcely hid the stones, it sprung up in deed a
little while: but because it had not earth enough underneath it to give it
moystre to the full rypenesse, anon after it was shot forth above ground, it
dried up and withered away as soon as any fervent heat of the sun came to
it, and so even in the first bladyng it perished. Again some of the seeds fell
among thorns, and sprung up in deed also, but the thorns that spro^g up with
it because they quickly shoot up and do commonly sprede themselves abroad of
more thickenesse and height also then the corn does, it came to pass that
the blade that had come of good sede, was smouldred and stiefled up, so that it
could not shoot up so high to have the open air at large. But yet did not all
the seeds fall unluckily. For some there was that fell upon good earth, and
when it was sprung forth brought, fruit an hundredfold double.

When the Lord had thus much said, ^
because he knew that the words which he had spoken were not perfectely
understood of every body: and yet willing to have them afterward bear well
in mind the parable which directly concerned the wealth of all creatures: he
cried with a loud voice, saying: no that has ears apt to hear the wisdom
of the ghospel, leat him harken we^ to the words which I have now spoken.
For they require to have an hearer neither gross of capacity and
understanding, nor that will stand gaping and yeanyng when he should give ear
as though he were more then half in sleep. And they apparteyne to every one of
you without excepcion. There be some which like unto dead images have ears
but not to hear me. They have ears enough to serve them unto Pharisaicall
constitucions, toward the doctrine of true godliness they are starcke deaf.

And the disciples which were nerest about Jesus, and most familiar with him,
desired him to declare the derke misterye of the parable. To whom thus he
said: unto you as unto familiar friends of household, it is given to know the
mystical secrets of the kingdom of God. The courts of temporal kings have
certain priuities belonging to the^, and matiers of counsel which are kept
privy from the multitude of the common people, and from all such others as
have nothing to do in the court? the kingdom of the gospel also has in
like manier secret priuities belonging to it, which many not without
consideracion and good cause why be uttered to every body at all auentures: but
must so be set forth as they may be seen only of them which are of house
hold belonging to God almighties court, and unto others it must be enwrapped
and shadowed in derke parables, to the entente that such as are unworthy
persons, when they see it, may not see it: and when they hear it, may not
understand it. And as for the parable this is the secret menyng of it. The
sower is the son of man, the ground the heart of man, the seed is the word
of the gospel. It is not yearthly seed but heavenly, ne proceeded from man:
and therefore called the word of God. The son of man leaves no place void,
The sede is the word of God.
but casts his sede abroad every where, but partly through the malice of
Satan, and partly through the defaulte of man it happens that the coming up
and growyng of it proves well but in few.

For the seed that fell by the way side betokens them which after a light
sort and negligently or slugyshely do hear the word of God: and byanby or
ever it can any thing settle in their minds, comes the devil, and putting
into them contrary thoughts, takes out of their mind all that they heard,
as one envying at their wealth, and with wicked suggestions doing all the let he
can that they may not atteygne salvation. For as the son of man laboreth
by all means possible to bring sinners to salvation: so does the other leave
nothing unattempted to draw as many as ever he may to damnacio^: he therefore
immediately after the castyng forth of the seed of the word evangelical,
flyghyng sodaynely to it, does gather it up ere it can cleue and stick fast
in the mind: so that by this time it forces nothing at all to have heard it.
Furthermore the sede received in stony ground does sygnifye them, which
hearing the word receive it with joy, and lay it up in their mind, so that
like the freashe grene blades of late sown corn newely shot up above
ground, they show some hope and tokens of godlynes of themselves in certain
outward things. But forasmuch as the thing which they have heard is not
thoroughly impriented in them, nor has not taken sure rootyng (as it were) in
the inmost affeccion of their hertes, they are for a little time obedyently
rewled after the word of god, but when any bloustryng storm of evils does
arise, they quaille and forsake their good beginning. For an easy thing it is
in prosperity to keep the doctrine of the ghospel, but if thou have not
thoroughly sucked and conceived an earnest affeccion and zele toward true
godliness: than at whatsoever time aduersitye requires that same stout
strength of an evangelical heart: that same face of holiness showed for a
time, does vanishe away.

Now the sede that fell among thorns does sygnifie them which after that
they have received the sede of Gods word, bear away with them no fruit of
true godliness thereby, because that their affeccion toward better living is
stifled and oppressed with cares of this world, And that which fell among
thorns etc.
with riches, and with the sensual pleasures of this present life. But the
sede that was cast upon good earth betokenethe them which with a sincere
heart taking dilygent head, and being void from all vain affeccions do
receive the wholesome word, and lay it up in their memory, and cause it
thoroughly to synke down into the bottom of their affeccions, so that by no
assault of evils they can be removed from the earnest exercise of godliness
ons entered and begone.

This parable therefore did Jesus vouchesalue to expound to his disciples
severally by themselves: partly because they should learn in other parables
after like manner with a godly curiosity to search out the derke meni^g of
them: No man when he lights a candle covers it with a vessel etc,
and partly that afterward when due time and occasion should be, they might
preach openly to al creatures the same thing which they had at that time
heard in secret. For the understanding of holy doctrine is a clear light.
And he that gives part of this light abroad to others, does not give it to
the intent to have it kept hidden, but that it may show light abroad to
many. For no man (says he) does light a candell, and being lighted does
cover the same with a vessel, ne sets it under the table: but he first
sets it on a candlestick to the end that such persons as come into the
house may se light. For there is nothing delivered unto you now privately or
entrieked or wrapped in derke parables: but the same hereafter must be opened
to the whole world, Take heed therefore how y^ hear.
nor nothing is now so derke or so closely hydden from the understanding of the
unlearned: but the same in process of time shall be brought out by you, and
shall be set forth to the knowlage of al creatures. Wherefore ye must take
even very special good heed, that ye with great carefulnes imprint in your
minds the things that ye now hear, so that nothing fall out of your
remembrance or peryshe. He that greedily receives the understanding of the
mistical doctrine of god, and diligently lays the same up in his heart as a
treasure, declares himself worthy to have mo things committed unto his
credit, forasmuch as he diligently keeps that which is given unto him. For
he that has, shall have more given him, but whosoever through his own negligence,
leseth the thing that he once had, such an one shall not only have no more
given unto him, but also even that same which he seemed to have, shall be taken
away from him, because he so rechelesly kept the evangelical treasour,
wherewithal how much the rycher that one is, so much the more does he covet
to be still ferther and ferther enriched.

And concerning such like matters as these are, the lord Jesus put forth many
other parables unto the people: all which every one of them, he expounded
severally unto his disciples. And because the Lord would declare what a
precious thing the doctrine of the gospel is, and with how great diligence and
carfulness it ought both to be taught and to be received: Than came to him
his mother and his brethren.
it happened on a certain day, that while Jesus was teaching the people, his
mother and his brethren came to the place being very desirous and feign to have
spoken with him about sum matter (whatsoever it was) concerning their familye
and household. And they could not cum to him for ye thick preasse of ye
multitude, wherefore there was word given him by others, that his mother and his
brethren stood at the door, being desirous to speak with him. But Jesus to
declare that the word of the gospel is a more precious thing, My mother and
brethren are these, which hear the word of God and do it.
then that it ought to be broken of, or interrupted for any worldly affeccions,
or for any care of householde buisynesse and affairs: made this answer to
them that had given him word of the matter: My mother (quod he) and my brethren
are they which hear the word of god, and do it, geuyng thereby a lesson,
that carnal kynred ought not to be regarded or acknowelaged, so long or as
often as any matters concerning the soul health are in hand.

An other thing moreover also it was the Lords will and pleasure by very true
matters in deed, to teach unto his discyples, how that in all matters of
trouble and business by means whereof this world would in time to cum arise
against the foreward procedynges of the gospel, they ought not to fall in any
despair of mind, nor any of them trust in his own strength, but to depend
and rest all on his help, and further that his help shall not fail us in any
perilles or dangers, at leastewyse, if we want not faithful trust in him, and
if we will with prayers, procedyng from the botome of our heart, call for his
aid and succor. It so befell therefore on a certain day, that Jesus when he
had taught the people all the day long, entered into a boat with his disciples,
and bid them make passage over unto the other side, the time now drawyng well
toward night. And as they were sailling, Jesus fell a sleep. And in the mean
season there suddenly arose a piere of wind, and so troubled the water, that by
reason of the waves cumming fast over into the ship, the disciples were in
ieopardye. And being sore afraid, they went unto Jesus, and reised him out of
his sleep, saying: Master thou slepest, and we perish. But Jesus arisyng up,
rebuked the wind, and the roughness of the water, and bid it to be still. And
immediatelye both elements, that is to wete, both the aier and the water
acknowlaged their Lord. And at his commandment immediately followed a great
caulmnesse and stillness of them both. And this being done, he turned to his
disciples, and chidyng them for that they had been so sore afraid in his
presence, seeing that they had hard him so often teach that nothing should hurt
the^, at least ways, if they would keep a steadfast and a continual faith and
trust toward him, thus he said: Where is now becu^ that same faithful
trust of yours that ye should have in me? truly the defaulte thereof was the
thing that reised up all this troublous blousteryng. Upon this, all the
coumpanie that were carried in the ship, when they saw the whole tempest
soodainly quieted in a moment at the only voice of his rebukyng, and seeing in
him certain manifest tokens of sum thing above the coumpace of man's reach:
they were taken both with a fear and also with a great woundrying at him, in
so much that they said: what a man is thissame? for he does not only
command and charge spyrites to go out of men, but also has rewle and
commandment over the dead and deaffe elements, the sea, and the winds, and
they obey his commandments. So often therefore as it shall fortune us also
to be in ieopardy, so often as Jesus slepeth in our mides, let us with godly
desires pluck him by ye sleue, let us with our continual prayers awake him,
and reise him: and immediately shall the tempeste be turned into caulmnesse.
Ambicion is an evil wind: wrathfulnesse and hatred are perilous
wheorlewyndes: naughty and corrupt desires be horrible waves and sourges: yea
and ready to ouerwhelme the barge of our mind, and to turn it vpsidedoune.
But the lord is to be reised out of his sleep, that he may command and rewle
these mocions, and straight ways shall all the tempeste cease.

So the water being all made caulme and still again, they saylled into the
land of the Gaderenites, which is right over against Galilee, a part of the
nether or lower Arabie. There met with him a certain man which had a devil
long time.
And when he was cum forth of the ship to land, there met him a certain
man, which had been now a great long season possessed and vexed of an
outrageous cruel spirit: in so much, that neither he could be kept covered
with any clothes, nor yet with any ropes or chains be kept at home within
doors: but he went wandryng about in the graves of dead folks, and oftentimes
would he out of them fly upon such as passed by on the way. This man rennyng
forth at the noise of strangers arriving there, saw Jesus, not without a good
turn and benefit for his part. For Jesus taking pity and compassion on the
manne, commanded the wicked spirit to depart out of him. And the party that
was possessed of ye devil fell down at the knees of Jesus. For a certain privy
power of the virtue of his godhed, had drawn the party unto him. But the
unclean spirit made an houge roaring out, through ye mouth of the miserable
selie creature, and said: O Jesus the son of the most high god in heaven,
what have I to do with thee? I beseech thee do not torment me. He fell down
before him. etc
For the commandment of ye lord wrought strongly upon him to leave the manne
whom he had by a long space vexed. Many times and often would this wicked
spirit cease on the man, and would after so manifold pieteous sorts most
cruelly tormente, and vex him, that breakyng all his fetters, his chains, and
al things that he was bound withal, he should be driven and feased of the
devil into desert places. Wherefore the said spirit was ill wyllyng and loath
to leave his old habitacion. Yea and moreover full sore was he afeard ^este
the day had been now cum, in which they should be adjudged to everlasting
pain and torment of hell, there to be eternally punished for all the evil and
woe which here in this world they torment and plague men withal. So than it was
not repentance of his evil doings that enforced him to these prayers, but
fear of punishemente. But Jesus to the end that the greatness of the miracle
should be the better known to all folks, demanded of the wicked spirit
what was his name. He au^swered, a legio^ (mening by this souldierly word
perteini^g to warfare, that the manne was possessed not of one devil alone,
but of an immunerable multitude of devils) for there is no one great sin
without a great ambushmente of vices together in a clouster. But there is no
sickness of the mind so grievous, there is none so great a multitude of great
offenses, but it gives place and departs at the commandment of Jesus. And
all these deuyls being now in fear thereof, prayed Jesus that in case it could
not be avoided but that they must needs be cast out of that man which they
were in, yet at least wise they might not be commanded to go down into the
deep pit of hell which place they know to be ordained for them at the last
day of judgment. There was an heard of swyne, etc.
And not far from the same place, upon a certain hill which lay hard by, in
manner directly above the same water, there was a great heard of swyne feedyng
at their pasture: so that even by that very point we may perceive that ye said
country was heathen, and wholly given to al ungodliness. For ye Jews by their
law did not, ne might eat no swynes flesh.

And the devils made request that by the sufferaunce of the lord they might
have liberty to flitte out of the man into the said hogs: so great a desire
and just had the wicked spirits to do hurt and mischief. And Jesus to make
ye thing both the more evident, and also the more terrible, suffered them to
have their desire. And immediately the deiuils leaft the man, and went into the
hogs, and straight ways was all the whole heard carried hedlong in a furious
rage as fast as they might drive into the poole, and were there drowned stone
dead. As soon as the swyneheardes saw this, they were sore afraid, and went
their ways thence as fast as they might run, into the tounes and villages to
bear tidings al about what was happened. The inhabitauntes of the countreye
scarcely beleuyng the tale that the swyneheardes told: went forth to see the
prouffe and tokens of that so incredible a matier. And cumming to the place,
they see the heard to be now peryshed and lost, which a little before was an
heard of a mighty great multitude. And the man also which till that time was
possessed of many deiuils, and for his notable mischief that he did in the
country was well known unto every body: him they find now all quiet and
pacient, and of whole mind, wearyng clothes on his body, and sitting at the
fete of Jesus. For of an harbourer of deiuils was he suddenly made a disciple,
and scholar of Jesus. And whereas to fore he was tumbled and driven by wicked
spirits to all kinds of mischief, now by the ientyll and meke spirit of the
most merciful lord, he is in framyng to all earnest and devout exercise of
godliness. Ferthermore they which had been there present and had with their
own iyes seen the man before possessed of deiuils, And they found the man,
sitting at the feet of Jesus.
and had heard that there was a legion, that is to say, a great noumbre of
deiuils in him, and now saw him in such a little while made perfectly whole,
they reported to ye residue of the people what had befallen. Whereupon a
certain fear came upon them all, where as they should rather have glorified
god, and lovingly enbraced the power of him who had restored health to a most
miserable creature, being otherwise past all hope of recovery. They would
feign therefore have had Jesus goen, as people dreding his power, but not
knowing his goodness: and they be more moved with the loss of their cattle,
then with the health of the man restored again. Yet durst they not be bold to
banishe or drive him out of their region: but the Gerasens ientilly desire and
pray him in the name of all the whole countreye to depart out of their
coasts, so great fear had taken and possessed them all.

And Jesus, because he would not cast an holy thing among dogs, returned
again to his ship. But the party which was delivered from devils, desired
Jesus that he might continue in his coumpaignye and awayte on him, seeing that
he was bound unto him alone and to none other for receiving his health. But
Jesus would not suffer it but said unto him: return to thine own house, to
the end that by thine own relacion, and by sight of thee, all folks may
certaynely know what thou were before, and what thou art now, through the
benefit of God. And show what thi^^ges soever god has done for (...)
Thy countrymen refuse to have me come and be among them: yet be thou at the
leastewyse a witness among them what ill friends they have been to themselves
in castyng me out of their region. The man obeyed the lords biddinges, and
going into Decapolis and throughout every city, he declared and talked in all
coumpaynies that he came emongst, what great and high benefits he had received
at the hands of Jesus. And thissame was yet some manier of entreaunce, and
first setting forth of preaching the gospel among folks being gross and
wieked and veraye well to be resembled to those swyne, into which the devils
did flitte when they left the man. Neither was the open publyshyng of this
man, whom the said deiuils had to fore possessed, altogether in vain. For
many did believe and meruayl at the thing. And certes by this exaumple or
figure, did the lord Jesus give a lesson to us that the grace of the gospel
ought to be proffered to every body, be they never so wieked, but yet
notwithstanding that the same is not to be thrust in their lappes being
unwilling to receive it, and also refusyng it. But again on the other side
they must be so leafte and forsaken, that some spark of true godliness be
left emongst the^, which one day in time to come may by occasion appear and
sparcle up.

Jesus therefore went back again by ship into Galilee, from whence he had
come, where he was now greatly spoken of, and wondreful in every man's mouth,
and at his returnyng a great multitude of men received him which with great
missyng of him did look for his return from ye Gerasenes. And behold eftsons
an occasion which might declare as well how ready Jesus was to help every
body, both rich and poor, good and bad, as also how much behind they were
in beleuyng and trustyng of God, which among the Jews seemed to be chief
pillours of religion, then those which among the inferior people were
accoumpted most vile and abject. For one of the chief of the Synagogue called
Iairus came to Jesus, and this Iairus had a daughter, within a little over or
under, about the age of twelve years, and she was even now in dying. He fell
down therefore at the feet of Jesus, desyryng that he would vouchesalue to
come home to his house and to help his daughter which even at that present
lay in dying. After such a like sort is the phisician wont to be called in a
time of vrge^t need: Come prove what thou can do: how much more full was
the feithfull trust and belief of the Centurion, which said yt it was no
need of his bodily presence, but that Jesus was hable with a mere word of his
mouth, to help and to heal whom him lusts? Jesus followed the desire of
Iairus and made haste toward his house.

And lo in his going on the way thitherwarde, by reason that the throng of
people wexed thick about him on every side, (so great was the desire of every
body both to hear him and to see him) Jesus was in manier borne down among
them. And even emongst the thickest of the people, there had wroong and
thrust in emongst them a certain in woman which had been sick by the spare of
twelve years of the bloody flixe, a disease lothely and much to be abhorred.
And for love of health, she had bestowed all her substance upon phisicians:
which from time to time fed her forth with fair promises of easing her pain*
howbeit they help her nothing at all, but cast her into another disease of
poverty, more then she had before. There this good wise woman being destitute
of all man's help, took her refuge unto gods help, conceyuyng a
meruaylous trust in Jesus, that if she might touch any part of him, or any
thing about him, she should be healed. Notwithstanding much ashamed she was to
come forth before him, and to discover her foul disease that was to be a
shamed of. But willing as it were by preu^e stealth to geat from him the
benefit of her health, she crepte and got to him behind his back and
touched the vtmoste skirt of his garment, which with the throng of the people
was drawn this way and that way. And immediately she perceived her disease
to be gone, and the bloody flixe to be clean stopped. And verayly Jesus nothing
enuyed the sick woman that had her health, but willing to show unto the
rewler of the synagogue and to the other Jews a pattern of perfect feyth, I
perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
said: Who has touched me? When others that went next unto him said that
they had not touched him: Peter and the other disciples which were next unto
Jesus never from his heles, said: Master, a thick press and throng of
people does on every side come upon the, and thrust thee, and as though there
were but two or three here, do thou ask who has touched thee? But Jesus
geuyng a by word that his speaking was of no common manier of touching, as his
disciples did mean, answered: some body has touched me, not after the common
facion of touching one another in going, but otherwise. He knows it himself
whosoever it be: for I at the touching felt a certain virtue proceed forth
from me unto the party that touched me. The ^ei^^ has saved the.
When no body made answer, and Jesus cast his iyes about all the coumpaynie,
as though he sought who it was, that would privily have stolen this benefit,
the woman knowing that what she had done half by stealth, was not unknown to
Jesus, came forth before him with great fear: and falling down at his feet
confessed before all the people, both for what cause she had touched him, and
also how she was immediately healed of her disease, whereof she had been sore
sick whole twelve years space the physicians taking great labor about her in
vain. The most merciful Lord drove her parforce to this confession: not to
shame the woman by detectyng her, but to declare unto the Jews how much and
how great a thing it is, that an assured feith may do. But Jesus comfortyng
the woman being now in fear, and lookyng for no less then a great rebuke for
her presumption, said: daughter thy feith has deserved to have thy health
given thee: go in peace, and this my benefyte be with the for ever: with this
saying he touched and nipped the pharisees and Scribes, who put more hope in
their own works, then in the goodness of God.

caught her by the hand, and cried, saying: maid arise. And her spirit came
again, and she aro^est reygh^waye. And he commanded to give her meat. And
the father and the mother other her were astouned. But he warned them, that
they should tell no man what was done. The lord Jesus had not yet ended
speaking these words, when one of the master of the Synagogues house came
rennyng and said: Sir never trouble ne disease ye the Lord any fe^ther, who
is now like to come in vain, for thy daughter is already dead: The fellow that
brought this word thought ne had no greater ne higher opinion or belief of
Jesus, then of some other especial good phisician, who could have helped her
being sick, and alive: but to reyse her again being dead, that were he by no
means hable to do. When Jesus saw Iairus deadly astouned and amassed at this
news, he conforted him saying: be not afraid: only have thou a feithfull
belief, and the gierle shall be safe.

When they were come to the Master of the Sinagogues house, Jesus would not
suffer any more of the multitude to go in at the doors with him, but Peter,
Beleu^ only and she shall be made whole.
James, and John, and with them also the father and mother of the gierle. When
he came in, he found the house all full of mourning, For the dead maiden was
wept for and bewailed of all her friends and kinsfolks: which dewtie and
office of mournyng is commonly dooen to the great rich folks at their
deaths for a pride and honor, more then for any sorrow. For they do make and
appoynte certain for the nonce to make lamentacion, to sing doulfull songs of
mourning, and to show an outward countenance of sorrow by weeping and wryngyng
of their hands, and beatyng or tearyng themselves. All this pomp and vain
show did Jesus refreigne and forbid, saying: make none of you no weeping: for
the maiden is not dead, but she slepeth. And they had him in derision for his
so saying: Weep not etc.
because they knew certaynely that she was dead in deed. Than Jesus entreyng
with a veraye few persons into the Inner chamber where the dead corpse of the
maiden lay, he took her by the hand, much like as though he should but awake
her out of her ^lepe, saying with a good loud voice: maiden arise. And what
followed? No creature a live does more lightlier awake from sleep at the voice
of any that calls him up, then this maiden arose again from death to life as
soon as Jesus spoke unto her. For not only her soul and life returned
again into the tabernacle of her body, from whens it had tofore departed: but
also she arose up, and walked about the house as merry and lusty as ever she
was before. And Jesus to thentent that it should be a more certain and
evident declaracion of life perfectely restored unto her, wylled meat to be
given unto her, which thing when the father and mother of the gierle saw, And
h^ commau^d^d to g^u^ her m^ate.
they were greatly astouned. And Jesus gave them a great charge, that they
should make no words to no creature of the thing that had happened as though
he had been very feign that this miracle should be known but to a few,
partelye to teach us, that we ought not to hunte for the glory and praise of
our well doings at the hands of men, and partly to signify by this figure
and exaumple, that in light faults a rebuke secretly given may be sufficient.
For the gierle being dead does betoken a man through weakness and
frailty fallen into syn. The death was yet freashe, the corpse had not come
abroad into open fight. Therefore the multitude being shut without doors, the
matier was al ended, and but a few persons made privy unto it. But happy and
blissed are they, whom Jesus does so vouchesalue to take by the hand.

The.ix. Chapter.
Jesus called the twelve together, The (...)
and gave them power, and authority over all deiuils, and that they might heal
diseases. And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God, and to hear the
sick. And he said unto them: Take nothing to your iourneye: neither staff,
nor sc^ip, neither bread, neither money, neither have two coats. And
whatsoever house ye enter into, there abide and thence depart. And whosoever
will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake of the very dust
from your feet, for a testimony against them. And they departed and went
through the tounes, preaching the gospel, and healyng every where.
ANd hitherto did Jesus execute and administre the office of preaching the
gospel in his own person, framyng by all the mean space, and traynyng his
twelve apostles many soondrye ways, as men that should after the receiving of
the holy ghost, succeed him in time to come in the office of preaching. And
for yt ve^aie cause it was, that he would in any wise have them continual
witnesses of his acts and preaching. But to the intent that in the mean
season they themselves also might show some pattern and saumple of themselves
toward the executing of so great an office, and even the lord being yet alive
they might assaye and prove how well they could do: he called them every one
together into one place, And gave the^ power and authority over all devils.
for a lesson and token that there ought to be no discord ne disagreyng among
them in their preaching. And to thentente that the preaching of such poor
mean fellows and unlearned persons should not vttrely altogether lack
authority: he gave unto them moreover the virtue and power to cast out all
kind of devils, and to heal al kind of diseases. For it was mete that they
which should preach the kingdom of God, should have power over wicked
devils, the enemies of god: and also that such as should be preachers of that
doctrine which healed al diseases of the mind, should not lack virtue to
heal all manier diseases of the body: yea and ferthermore convenient it was*
that the people should be allured and woonne to the profession of the gospel,
by good turns and benefits, rather then by things of terror. According to
the exaumple (says he) that my self have given you, see that you gladly and
freely use your power to the heal^yng of al peoples diseases and miseries: see
that ye corrupt not the synceritie and pureness of preaching the gospel, by
any suspicion of dooyng it for advantage and lucre. Than appointed he unto
them in plain words what it was that they ought to teach. For he gave them
in commission no such thing, as to teach the ceremonies of the law, which
should with in a short time be abolished: not to teach blind constitucions
of men, as the Scribes and Pharisees used to teach, when they go round about
both the sea and the land to make one selie proselite, or nouice of their
sect: But he gave them in commau^demente to teach that the kingdom of God
was at hand. Which kingdom of God, did not now consist in outward things to
be dooen with the body, but in spirit and virtue. And thus much to preach
unto the rude ignorant people, was for that present time at the beginning
sufficient for preparyng of men's hertes unto an higher doctrine. And for
because the carfulness of things necessary for the sustentacion of the
body should by no means let them from the buisinesse of the ghosphell, he
said unto them: Carrye no kind of baggage about you on the way* neither
staff to defend you withal, ne scrippe to keep your meat in for store, ne
purse wherein to put any money for expenses, Take nothing to your journey,
nether sta^, nor scrip.
or charges necessary, no nor two coats: for be ye well assured, that ye
shall not any where lack any one of all these things, if ye shall with pure
hertes according to the tenor of my commandment, diligently provide and
labor that the gospel go forward and daily increase. For every where shall
there be, whose voluntary ientilnesse and liberality shall give as much as for
you being men that live from hand to mouth, and can be content with a
litell, may at all times be sufficient. Neither shall ye have any cause to be
pe^sife or careful, And what soever house ye enter into^ and
where or how to be enterteined for lodgeyng or harbor: for wheresoever ye
can know of any that are worthy and mete for the kingdom of god, turn ye
into their houses, and there continue at soiourne, lest if ye should every
other while be flyttyng from one house to another, ye may seem to have dooen
it for sekyng of deyntie fare. But being content with such chere as ye shall
there find, tarry ye so long in the houses of the same persons, until the
good procedyng and increase of the gospel shall advertise you to go forward
to another place: but if it shall any where so happen, that no body will
receive you into their house, yet acknowlage and remember the woorthynesse and
dignity of your office, and be not over earnest to thrust into their lappes
whether they will or no, the thing, which every creature ought most specially
to crave: but streightwayes forsake ye that same city, being so far from
taking any kind of commodity by such persons, as wilfully reiecte your
preaching, that ye shake of and cast back again unto them, yea even the
veraye duste that may happily chance to have stycked on your feet: plainly
testifying and protesting unto them, that ye have freely preached the kingdom
of God unto them, and that they have made themselfes unworthy of so great a
gift freely proffered unto them. And they departed.
When Jesus had with these and many other words mo enstructed and armed his
Apostles, forth they went two and two together: and going round about to
every town and village, they preached euerywhere that the kingdom of God was
come. And whersoeuer they found any men possessed with devils, or sick, or
in daungier of any other impediment of the body, they healed them in the name
of Jesus. And this was the first rudimente and entreaunce of the Apostles
preaching.

By reason of these things the name of Jesus was so bruited abroad and made so
famous, that the report of all his workings and doings came eue^ to the
ears of Herod the Tetrarche. For whereas he knew not Jesus, and heard sat
that a certain man there was who at the byddyng of his word could and did cast
out deiuils, did put away diseases, did restore the lame, and such as were
taken and had their sinowes shrounken, did make clean the lepres, did raise up
the dead to life again: he was in great doubt and wonderously troubled in his
mind, what man this might be so suddenly sprung up.

Some boasted abroad that Jesus was John, whom Herod a little tofore had
flayne, and the same John to have returned to life again, and therefore being
now as it were made half a God, to be wexed mighty in dooyng of such great
miracles. Others said, that he was Helias, whom being taken up in a fiery
chariot, the Jews did look for that he should cum again, according to the
prophecy of Malachias. Again sum supposed he was sum other of the old
Prophets, the memory of which Prophets was high and holy, and was had in
great reverence among the Jews. Iho^ have I beheaded.
Howbeit Herod fearing on his own behalf if John were revived again whom he
had put to death, and reckening it a thing incredible, yt a man once dead,
should be returned again to life, said: As for John I mine own self have
caused to be beheaded, who being dispatched and rid out of the world, I thought
there had none been left a live which would have enterprised to do any such
great matters. And what fellow is this of who^ I hear much greater things the^
ever John wrought? And hereupo^ he earnestly sought sum occasion to have a
sight of him, not to be made better thereby, but to satisfy his own curiosity
to know all things, orels in case he should so think good, to do even
thatsame by him that he had done by John before. But Jesus forasmuch as he knew
Herodes mind welinough, would not cum where to be seen of him. For he was not
cum for any such purpose to feed or delight the iyes of wicked princes with his
miracles, but to bring the simple poor folks to health: nor to be beheaded did
not like him, who had predestinate unto himself the high exalted standard of ye
cross. After this the twelve returned home again unto Jesus, with great
cherefulnes, declaring how the preaching of the gospel had very well
prospered, and how great miracles even they also had done in his name. But
Jesus called them back unto sobrenesse and humility, teaching that they
should not wexe any thing the more haulte, ne take any thing the more highly
upon them for the prosperous success of any such manner things. For he
enfourmed the^ that miracles are wrought and done through the power of god and
not of men, and the same oftentimes to be showed forth by other men, then such
as are predestinate to everlasting life: and that only the godliness of mind
does make a man blessed, whether he have ye power to work miracles, according
as the time requires, orels have it not. Jesus therefore of purpose to teach
them by the deed self, and by the lively practysyng of the very thing, after
what sort they ought to feed the multitude with the food of Gods word and of
the gospel which they had learned of him, he went aside with them out of
the cumpany into a desert place, where they might repose themselves awhile
after ye labor of their journey. For in that place there was so great a
resort of people about them, that they could have no manner time of respite, no
not so much as to eat their meat. He had them away therefore into a
solitarye place hard by a city of Galile called Bethsaida, which was the
native country of Peter, Andrewe, and Philip all three, and doubtelesse this
departing aside into a place solitary, was not bestowed upon fond sensual
pleasures or on sleep, but upon a quietness to pray and to give thanks to God.
For of such sort ought the pastyme and relaxacion of such men as are folowers
of the Apostles to be. But as soon as it was spread abroad by the brute of ye
people, whither Jesus had conveyed himself to be solitary: an innumerable
multitude of people gatheryng together in clousters on every side, And he
received the^.
went after him into wilderness. Than Jesus seeing the gredy desires of them,
came out of the solitary places that he had gone to for to repose himself, and
so littell mind had he to put them away from him, that he went of his own
accord to mete them, teaching his disciples thereby this lesson also that after
a little short time of reposyng themselves they ought even anon eftsoon to
return from restyng, And spoke unto the^ of the kingdom of god.
unto the office of preaching the gospel. When Jesus was cum forth, and saw
the infinite multitude or men, women and children, that had cu^ so great a
journey on foot out of diverse places into deserte, as sheep wandryng hither
and thither, for lack of a shepeheard, being moved with pity and compassion,
he first fed their souls speaking unto them many things of the kingdom of
god: than did he heal them which were holden with great diseases and other
maladies of the body.

While these things were in doing, the day began to draw toward an end.
And the apostles consyderyng the multitude to be infinite, and the eue^^ide to
draw nere, the place to be far from any town or village, and that they had
no vytayles there: they put Jesus a litell in remembrance, saying: Leat go
the people in season, that going into the next litell towns and villages here
about, they may geat themselves meat: for this is a desert place where is no
meat to be gotten. And Jesus to show that they which with all their heart
applied the doctrine of the gospel, should be so provided for, that they should
never lack meat, and also minding that the miracle which he intended there
and than to show, should be very evident, he au^swered his disciples: they
need not for this purpose to depart hens into any towns or villages: but
rather give ye them meat your selves: showing unto them by the same by word,
that this thing also does otherwhyles appertain to the duty of one that
supplieth an Apostles room to relieve the necessitye of their flock with part
of their own substance, be it never so small. And the Apostles at this time
lacked no good will, We have no mo but five loaves and two fyshes.
but sorry men they were that they lacked ability. And therefore they au^swer
in this manner: we have not a bytte of meat in the world, more the^ five loaves
and two fishes: And this provision will scarcely be enough for us, as few as
we be for our supper, except percase it be thy pleasure that we shall gooe
into the next tounes and villages here about to bye meat, as much as may
serve so great a multitude as here be. But thereunto had we need to have a good
sum of money, whereas we have but right small store of money among us all.

For there were almost the full noumbre of five thousand men. Then said Jesus:
Cause ye them to sit down by compaynies, and so to divide themselves that
they sit by fifty and fifty in a compaynye. And they were about five
thousand men.
For so do they that make a feast of a great noumbre, use to appoynte a
determinate noumbre of persons and messes to every table, that the butlers and
other seruitours may know how much to appoynte and prepare for the same. The
Apostles although they saw no provision toward, yet at the lords
commandment, they bydde the people to sit down by compaynies as before is
said, even as though meat should immediately be set before them. The people
also on the other side even with like playnesse do as they are bidden. Jesus
therefore a man of a new and a strange facion to be a feaster of geastes,
took the five loaves and two fishes, and liftyng up his iyes straight to
heaven, he first hallowed them with luckie words of multiplying, and than he
brake the same, and delivered it by piece meal unto his disciples, And h^ took
the five loaves and blissed them.
to set before the people. They were every one refreashed with as much as they
would eat, and so far they were from lackyng any thing, that when every body
was satisfied with the largest, there were twelve baskettes full of broken meat
gathered by the hands of the disciples. And in this matier too, there lies
hidden a figurate representacion of a more secret doctrine. The Apostles had
provision of viaundrie, but it is such as belongs to Jesus. This viaundrie
like as it is of light price and course gear for poor folks eating, so is it
but little in quantity. For the doctrine of Moses is manyfolde: and the
philosophiers learning is of soondrie manier sorts of matiers and full of
plenteous stuff: but the word of the gospel is plain homely gear, and
short, and yet such as may suffice for the souls of all nations to be
refreashed, in case it be delivered and received as it ought to be. To men of
the apostles profession is the word committed, wherewith souls are made
fat: but the same word do they not set before the people to feed on,
except it be first consecrated and broken of Christ. For than and never else
is it the true fruit of preaching the gospel, if the teacher do not
presumpteouslye usurp to himself the gift of learning which he has as a
thing committed to his credit, ne indiscreetly or misaduisedly show forth
the same as though it were of his own: but yield it unto Christ to be made
holy of him. Otherwise all in vain shall the teachers labor be when he
preaches, unless Jesus shall first have blissed the word, unless he shall
have broken it, unless he shall with his own hands deliver it to be
distributed to the people. For piththye and effectual it is whatsoever
proceeds out of his holy hands, he only it is, that fedeth, that refreshes,
that makes full: bishops are nothing else but ministers and distributoures of
an other man's liberality. The people all the while sits down in
coumpanies upon the ground nothing stickyng or doubtyng, nothing murmuryng or
repinyng, whereby is signified, that in the faithful congregation of Christ's
church, there ought to be sobre humility, and plain faithful trust of the
heart in god, without any doubleness, and that all discord and sedicious
vproare ought to be away. Consider me ferthermore this mystery too. The Lord
Jesus first of all things taught and healed the people, and than fed them
afterward.

The word of God also is the heavenly meat of the soul. But sum portion
hereof is not denayed to the ungodly and to the newely entered or instructed in
the faith. For it is the medicine of men's souls, and the refeccion of the
weak. For wholesome doctrine works the like effect in the souls of sinners
that Jesus with his word and his touching did in diseases of the body. But
there is a mistical bread which is not given but to persons now already well
taught, and also thoroughly healed. The Same forsouth is that heavenly bread of
the lords body, which is not given to those that are not yet through baptism
received into the body of the church and congregation: ne unto such, whose
mind and soul is holden with some grievous crime, as it were with a mortal
sickness. And that same meat of the privy hidden wisdom of God, (which
Paul the Apostle did not show forth but among the perfect,) is not to be
uttered unto all persons at adventure.

Now because the lord had so tempered all his sayings and doings, that some
whiles he would show forth tokens of his godly power, and another time he
would manifestely show the verity of his humayn nature: the opinions of men
concerning him did much vary. But because it was requisite that among them,
by whom he had appointed to renew the world, there should be one uniform
profession perfectly agreyng in it self concerning him: Who say y^ people
that I am?
at a time when he was in his prayer solitary with his disciples, he demanded
of them what opinion the people had of him, or whom they said that he was. The
disciples answer: some suppose thee to be John the Baptiste revived again:
some say that thou art Helias, of whom the Jews think that he shall come
again before that Messiah shall come: and some others believe the to be some
one man of the old Prophets called to life again. Than said Jesus. As for
the people, they are inconstaunt and waueryng as they are wont to be. But ye
that know me nerer and familiarly, who dooeye say that I am? There Petur
being more ardent and fyerie then the residue, Simon Peter answered and
said: thou art the Christ of God. etc
made answer in the name of them al: we know thee to be Messiah, whom God
has enoynted with all heavenly gifts of grace: And this their right
profession Jesus in deed allows well, but yet he gives them a great charge,
that they should make no words to no creature, what opinion they were of.
For he said the time of openyng that mystery in the open face of all the
world was not yet come, and that the sacrifice of his death must first be
executed and accomplished, and that he was appointed to come to the glory of
that name, by many kinds of despite and reproach. For the son of man, says
he, must abide much woe, and must be reproved of thelders, and of the
Scribes, and of the chief of the priests, yea and at length be slain too,
and arise again from death to life the third day. Ye must therefore beware,
lest the glory even of this name if it should now at this present be
preached, should not find feyth to be credited, because of the affliccion and
death of the body, and so might be a let to my death. But whosoever does
lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it. For what auauntageth it a
man, if he win the whole world, and lose himself, or run in damage of
himself. For whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words: of him shall the soonne
of man be ashamed, when he comes in his majesty, and in the majesty of his
father, and of the holy Angels. I tell you of a truth: There be some
standing here, which shall not ^ast of death; till they see the kingdom of
God. Than where Petur at the mencionyng of death trembled and quaked for
veraye fear, and advised Christ to some other better ways then so, when
Jesus had put him to silence, he begoonne to exorte his other disciples also
to the following of his death, saying: Thus has it pleased my father: by this
way must I come to glory. And whosoever will be a disciple of mine, if he
gladly desire to be partaker of my blissfulness, he must of necessitye be a
follower of my death before. It is not enoughe to go following me on foot at my
hel^s where I go: he must follow me in deeds, or else will I not acknowelage
him for a disciple. For whosoever shall come to the office of preaching the
gospel, must deny himself altogether, and must renounce all the cares of
this world for ever, richesse, pleasures, promocions, kyns^olkes, affeccions,
yea and life it self also, and must every day take his cross on his back,
having his mind evermore ready unto all such things, as ye see that I abide
and endure. I will go before you as the master: leat him come after whosoever
shall be minded to be a disciple. Neither is there any cause why ye should
fear to be slain. For so to peryshe, is to be preserved. For whosoever
shall lose his life for my sake, the same has set his life in perfeicte
safetye: and on the contrary side: whosoever stertyng back or shrynking away
from the buisy charge of the ghospel, shall have a mind to save the life of
his body, the same shall lose the life of his soul, which alone and none but
that is to be reckened the true life: and for the preseruyng of this life, it
is the part of a wise man gladlye to take the loss of all other things in
the world. For what shall it avail a man, if he win all that ever this
world has woorthye to be desired, when he has lost his own self? when
the man's self dies those things also that he had gotten are perished and
gone with him. And he perishes altogether in deed, whosoever has lost
everlasting life. Leate no disciple of mine think shame to suffer such things
which I my self shall suffer. Leate him not be ashamed to profess my
doctrine before all the world. For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my
words before men as one offended and slaundred with the worldly shame of the
cross: of such an one shall the son of man again be ashamed, when after
the laiyng down of the infirmity of the fleashe, he shall come at the secou^d
time showing forth unto the whole universal world the majesty of himself,
of his father, and of his holy aungelles. And doubt ye nothing that the thing
that I say, shall one day come to pass. For this I affirm unto you for a
matter of assured truth. Some there be here among you standing by, which
shall not depart out of this life, but that they shall first in some part se
the majesty of the kingdom of god. The thing that now lies hidden, shall
one day in time to come be made open and manifest unto all creatures.

that were with him, were heavy with sleep: And when they awoke they saw his
majesty, and two men standing with him Than Jesus to perform the promysse
which he had now made, did about theight day after these words speaking,
choose out three of his.xii. Apostles, that is to we^e, Petur, James, and John,
and according to his accustomed wont, he got him up to a mountain, there to
pray. And as he was in prayyng, his face was soodaynly changed into an other
lykenes replete with majesty and glory, and his garments shone as white as
any snow. There were seen also with him at the same instaunte two other men of
like majesty talking with him, of whom the one was Moses and the other
Helias: For the law had by figures set out Christ derkely (as it were) in a
shadow, and the prophecies had directely poynted him out what he was. Now
the talkyng of these two with Jesus, And spoke of his depar^yng. etc.
what other thing does it signify, but the perfeicte agreyng of the old and
new Testamente together? Their talkyng with him was concerning the kind of
death, which the Lord according to ye tenor and form of the prophecy
many a day before written and set forth by them, should afterward
accomplish at Jerusalem: to the^de that eftsons the delectable sweetness of
the glory, should be brought to a tempre with the mention of death. But all this did not the Apostles even very well see, because they had their iyes even
heavy with sleep. But as soon as they were awaked, they plainly saw the
majesty of the Lord, and also the two men standing hard by him.

Which two men when they begun to depart from Jesus, Petur fearing lest all
that same delectable sight should also go away, he said unto Jesus: Master
it is no going any whyther out of such a place as this. Fare well Jerusalem
and leate it go, which threateneth to put thee to death. Tushe (...) us rather
make three tabernacles here in this mountain, one for the, one for Moses, and
one for Helias. Thus spoke Petur as a man inebriate and made droncken with the
sweetness of this vision, not knowing what he said. For he required to
triumph before he had woonne the battle: and would have had the best game
of rennyng, There came a cloud and over shadowed them. etc.
before he had ten for it. Even in the instaunte time while Petur was
speaking these words, there soodaynly arose a cloud and cast a shadow over
all the disciples, being now not hable in their mortal body, to abide the
beholding of so great glory. And while Moses and Helias were entreyng into the
cloud, and were vanishing away from the iyes of ye disciples (for reason it
was that the light of evangelical truth apperyng, (...) shadows and
mystical derkenesse of figures should give place and be go^^) the voice of
his heavenly father sowned down from the cloud saying: Moses and Helias, who
prophesied of my son, the Jews have hitherto had in high estimacion and
reverence. Great men were they two in deed, yet were they but my servants. But
thissame is he that is my son, so dear beloved unto my heart. as none other is
but he alone, therefore harken ye to him. This voice thus sounyng in their
ears, Jesus was found alone, lest they might have demed the testimony of
that voice to concern any other person then eue^ very him only. Jesus was
found alone
And the said three disciples right so as they were commanded of the Lord,
kept the matter close, and reported not the priuity of that vision to any
creature alive, until Christ had arisen again from death to life after his
passion. For it was not the Lords pleasure to have the majesty of his Godhed
published or openly spoken of before the time of his death, And they kept it
close. etc.
as well because there should be nothing that might be a let unto thatsame
sacrifice whereby mankind was to be restored, as also because that thing
might not be openly talked of, which no man would than believe, if it had
been reported. And all under ^ne, did he therein by an exaumple, that was a true
matter in deed, give a lesson to us, that in case any excellent good thing be
in us, we should ra^h^^ keep it close then make vauntes or braggues thereof: and
in case we have any special virtue or good qualitye in us by the free gift of
God, the same is to be declared and showed in deeds, rather then by making
many gaie or high words of it.

The next day following, Jesus came down from the hill with his said three
disciples. And he found a mighty great multitude of people gathered about the
residue of the disciples, whom he had left there behynd him when he
addressed him to go up to the mountain. But the people as soon as they espied
Jesus returnyng again, went to mete him. For they had found a great lack and
mysse of his presence. And there had happened a fresh matter, why they should
require to have his presence. For one of y^ cou^paignie cried out to him
saying: master, I most humbly beseech thee, leat the extreme misery of a
son of mine move the. For I have no mo but him alone: and he is holden with
an extreme tyrannous devil, which does every other while soodaynlye take
him, and vexes him sundry ways, that pity it is to see, with much great
roaryng, flasshyng him on the ground, and so wrestyng his limbs as though he
would tear them from the body of him, and he fomyng at the mouth for peine
all the while. And as often as he takes him, he scracelye departs from him,
until all his body be rent and torn. I prayed thy disciples to cast out this
spirit. They did their best, but they have not been hable to do it. Than
Jesus well perceiuyng that the thing had so chanced by reason of the fathers
unbelief that prayed for health to his soonne: I besought thy disciples to
cast him out and they could not.
and in consideracion of his disciples feithe being yet hitherto but weak, he
cried with a loud voice, saying: O nation full of mistrustyng, and of an heart
nothing single, how long time shall I be conuersaunt among you, and shall
suffer these things? Can I not yet all this while bring thus much to pass,
to make you have a perfeicte feyth and trust in me? does the weakness of
this body of mine so much leate you? And turnyng himself to the man, and
requyring of him before hand to have a more steadfast feith, he said: Bring thy
son hither to me. And as soon as the young thing was brought to Jesus, the
eiuil spirit that was in him took him, quasshyng the child on the ground:
And they were all amassed at Y^ mighty power of God.
and immediatelye Jesus restored him to his health, and gave him to his father
again made perfectely whole, where his father had brought him thither
impossible to be cured by any man's help. The more miserable that the sight
of this eiuill had been, so much the more did the people every one of them
meruaill to see how quickelye the child was helped out of hand, by the
virtue and power of God.

But when the fame of Jesus weaxed every day more and more famous through
such acts as these: A certain temptacion of worldly glory entered into the
hertes of his disciples, by reason that they had such a master, in whose
name, even they also themselfes did many great acts to be woondred at. But
Jesus calls them home from this affeccion to the contemplacion of his low
state of abieccion in this world, at which the time was not long to come,
when they would be offended and slaundred. The glory of dooeyng miracles
(says he) is now a matter of delectacion unto you: but it is a thing much
more material for you, depely to enprint in your hertes these sayings of
mine, from which your minds do gretlye abhor. For that thing ought ye
most of all to have in mind, which it shall behoue every one of you to
follow. As for glory leat me alone to see for that. For the thing must needs
come to pass, that I have already told you, and yet now again I say unto
you, which is, that the soonne of man, whose glory and fame does now delight
you, shall ere long be attached, and shall be delivered into the hands of
men, and shall sundry ways suffer much affliccion, and shall lastely be put
to death. This tale, though it had been once or twice heard out of his mouth,
yet had not it well settled in the minds of the disciples. For they could not
well bear in mind the thing which they had no lust to hear. For it will come
to pas that the so^n of man.
They abhorred the mention of death: as men setting al their minds on the
glory of Jesus, not having all the while any intelligence or understanding that
the glory of the Lord was most chiefly to be renoumed and made famous,
through the open worldely shame of hangyng on the cross. And in deed they
heard a speaking of death, but it was as it had been half in a dreme, nothing
well understanding what the thing meant which was spoken, and yet durst they
not demand any questions of him, what these words might mean, And they
feared to ask him of that saying
having freash in their remembraunces, that Petur when he was somewhat over
bold and buisye with Jesus, had heard Jesus say unto him: auaunt out of my
sight thou Satan, thou haste no saueryng of those things that appertein to
God, but altogether of such things as appertein to y^ world.

After all this same, Jesus went to Capernaum: And so it was, that forasmuch
as the disciples were yet carnal, because they had seen the glory of weorking of
many miracles, and because they had heard the majesty of the kingdom of God
promised, and because theimselfes too, had dooen many woondrefull things above
nature at ye name of Jesus: a certain worldly thought entered into them which
at last braste out thus far, that as they were going on the way, they
reasoned together one with an other, which of them should suit highest in the
kingdom of heaven. For they dreamed that such a like order should be in the
kingdom of heaven, as they had seen in the courts of worldely princes, or in
rich folks houses, in which he that is more proud, and quicker or bolder
spirited then an other is, he is the more Iolier fellow. Than Jesus, although
he knew well enoughe what it was, that they had among theimselfes kept
disputacions of: yet as soon as he was come into ye house, he demanded of
them what the matter was, that they had so hardelye disputed and reasoned of
by the way. And they all plaiyng mum, and not having a word to say, because
they were half ashamed of the matter, Jesus to show that their thoughts and
their privy talks behynd his back were not hydden ne unknown to him, took a
little innocente child in his hand, and set him hard by his side, and calling
the twelve together unto him, he said: ye dispute of greatness, which of you
shall be greatteste. The greatteste with me are those that are most inferiors.

What is more plain without fraud or guyle, then this little child, or what
thing more low? Even very such must ye become, if ye will be chief in the
kingdom of the ghospel. The kingdom of feith and charity, knows none
ambicion, Whosoever receives this child in my name
it is not acquainted with plaiyng the Lord, it can no skill of tirannye:
whatsoever person receives unto him such a child as this, in my name,
receives me myself: and whosoever receives me, receives him that has sent
me. If I have played the Lord toward you, than reason you also who shall be ye
chief among you: but if I have rather used my self as a willing and a ready
servant to the commodities of all persons, know ye that he shall be a great
man among you all, who in contemnyng of glory, in humility and submission, and
in fervent affeccion to be as a servant to do all creatures good, shall be
the least and most inferior of all men.

And because they had heard him say, that little ones are to be received in
the name of Jesus, it came into John's mind, that they had excluded and
debarred a certain man from the fraternity of ministering the ghospel. He
therefore is in a doubt, whether that like as all men were to be received
unto the fellowship of the salvation of the gospel, so in like manier all men
were to be admitted to the ministracion of preaching the gospel, We saw ne
castyng out devils in thy name
and to the weorkyng of miracles. And in this poyncte was hydden a litell spice
of a certain secret pangue of envy. God had tofore given power unto the
twelve only, to cast out devils: and to heal diseases. This dignity they
thought not me^e to be made common to any others. And therefore John said:
master at the time when being sent forth by thee, we executed the office of
preaching the gospel abroad: we saw a certain man casting out devils in thy
name, though he be none of the noumbre of us twelve, no nor does not so
much as follow thee neither. This man, as one being a stranger to our
brotherhood, we forbadde that he should no more so do. Than Jesus although
he would in no place suffer himself to be preached of by the wicked spirits,
yet teaches that men of what sort soever they be, are not to be forbidden
from having to do in the ghospel, although they do the same of no very sincere
heart, so that (says he) the thing that they do, For he that is not agist us,
is with us.
they do it in the name of Jesus, and do the same thing that ye do. For
whosoever is not an adversary unto us, does even in that veraie point make
on our side, that he does not against us. To such a thing as is strange and
by all possible ways to be every where published abroad, al favor does
avail. The miracle is not his yt does it, but Gods, who shows his power
by man, as by his ministre and instrument. Therefore whatsoever person shows
any miracle by calling upon my name, dooethe publishe and spread abroad my
glory, and debarreth himself of al title to speak (...) of me from thensforth,
whose name he has found so effectual and full of power. And so it befell, that
the time being now veraye nere at hand, when Jesus leauyng the earth,
should be received up into heaven, the Lord had already entered his journey,
and showed eue^ plainly by his countenance, that he was bound toward
Jerusalem, as one that purposely minded to be in the way against the occasion
of his death should come. He therefore sent messagers before him two or three of
the Apostles, to prepaire him some harbourgh and place of soiourneyng within a
certain city of the Samaritanes, through which his journey lay. And when
they came, the tounesmen had shut the gates of the city against them,
because they coniectured by the very facions and countenance of the Apostles,
that they were gooyng toward Jerusalem.

For the Samaritanes, in consideracyon that all their woorshyppyng of God was
in a mountain of their own, hated and abhor^ed all such as went to Jerusalem
in the way of devotion to worship God there. Upon this James and John who had
been sent on the said message, when they saw the vncourtesie of the
inhabitau^tes there, which would not suffer them so much as to come within
the precinct of their town walls: being even all out of patience, said to
the Lord: Master, is it thy pleasure that we bid fire to come down from
heaven, as Helias ons did, which may consume these fellows? But Jesus because
he would show how great the mildenes of a teacher of the gospel ought to
be, bridleed their wrathefulnesse with a sharp rebuke, saying: Take ye not
the deed of Helias for your exaumple. He being led with the spirit brought the
wicked people of that time to confusion. But as for ye do not yet understand
what spyrite ye ought to be of. That same spirit of the ghospel is more meke
then so. There shall hereafter come a time of redress and vengeance. But
until that day the son of man is come, not to cast away men's lives or
souls, but to save them. They yt do now at this present keep us out of their
town, will peradventure an other day hereafter take us in. They are therefore
to be saved, that they may be in case to repent and emende. And so leauyng
the town, they turned an other way to an other little town. By these words
Jesus took out of their stomakes al desirefulnesse of doing vengeance, and
taught us to use favorable bearyng toward such as at the first beginning
would exclude and keep out the doctrine of the ghospel from them, allegeyng
that it was enough to leave such for a season until they might at a time of
occasion be converted to a better mind.

Again it fortuned as they went, that a certain man of his own voluntary
mind, said unto Jesus: I will follow the whithersoeuer thou shall go. And
Jesus myndyng to show that such as brought not with them minds mete for
such a weighty matter, were not to be admitted to the fraternity of
preaching the ghospel, (for that better it were not to take the matter upon
the^ then to give it over again, after it were once taken in hand) said unto
him: Foxes have holes of their own in the earth, and birds of the aier have
their nestes in the trees: but the son of man has not any place where to
put his head in. Such an one therefore as has any thing in this world,
whereon to set his delight, or whereon to set his full rest and quiet, is no
mete follower of the son of man. He must renounce all things, that will
follow me

Again when he had cast his iye on a certain other man, he said unto him:
follow me. But he made this answer: Master give me leave first to buirie my
father. But Jesus geuyng a bywoorde that the cause of salvation is to be
preferred before all poync^es of carnal duetye, said unto him: Leate the dead
buirye their dead: but gooe thou and show abroad the kingdom of God. By this
exaumple did the Lord forfende the excuses of such men which under the
color of natural affeccion and duty, Leat ye dead buirye their dead.
do put of and delay the care and earneste appliyng of eternal salvation.
And yet a wurse ^orte of men then those, are they which under the color of
fyndyng stoppes and lettes about the affairs of their household, do prolong
and drieue of fro morrow to morrow, the matter of salvation, which ought even
at the first occasion straight way to be gone through withal. For there came an
other man to him, No man yt puts his hands to ye plough and looks back
who being commanded to follow him, answered: Master I will come after
thee, do no more but suffer me to go bid my familiar friends and my
household farewell. Than said Jesus, whosoever has ons put his hand to the
plough and than afterward looks back again, is not apt for the kingdom of
God. This matter of the gospel, is an high matter, and an hard to come to,
which whosoever has ons enterprised, the same must with a pe^pertuall appliyng of
it, proceed still and go forward to things of more and more perfeccion, and
never turn his mind away to the vile cares of transitorye things of this
world.

The.x. Chapter,

AFter these things the Lord chose and took out of the noumbre of his
disciples other seue^tie also, as he had tofore chosen his twelve Apostles, and
sent them two and two before him into every city and place whether he himself
had determined to come: to the end that by their preaching and teaching before,
they might prepare and make ready the minds of the people against the cumming
of the Lord. These did he even so enstructe how to preach and teach his
ghospel, as he had before taught the twelve, and he showed and opened the
cause, why he had so increased the noumbre of preachers, saying: The harueste
is great, but the laborers are few, pray ye therefore the lord of the
harueste, to send forth laborers into his harvest. Far is the roumour and
brute of the gospel spread, and many are set on fire with the gredye desire
of the doctrine of heaven: they are well willing toward it, The harvest is great
but the laborers are few.
and want, but only such as should call and gather their minds together,
being of theimselfes both ready and full of have toward the kingdom of
heaven. Gooe ye therefore puttyng your wholle trust and confidence in the
safegarde and maintenance of me alone. Such as are great men and has rewle
of things, such as are ^iuill, shall murmour and grutche against your
doctrine. Against these men do I send you forth naked, without weapon or
fense. For I send you not, that you should hurt or grieve any man, but that
ye, full of simplicity and void of all hutte, should study and endeavor your
selfs to profit and do good to every man. Seek ye not therefore help at man's
hand, that ye may therewith arm^ and defend your self against the violence,
and maliciousnes of the eiuil, nor take you no care ne thought for your living,
or things necessary, but with all readiness go ye to the buisinesse of ye
gospel: neither carrying scrip nor wallet, nor yet shoes with you, for ye shall
never want, that shall be sufficient for nature. Salute no man, neither the
welthy lest ye seem to flattre and seek upon the^ for gain, nor the indurate,
lest ye seem to favor their ungodliness. Nor take you no thought for house or
lodgeyng: there shall be those which shall receive and take you in at their
doors: only show your selfs pure and vncorrupt mynisters of the gospel.
And what house soever ye shall enter into, first wish and pray for peace to
the whole household. That if there be any there, yt is the son of peace, that
is to say, a ientill and meke man and one that thristeth the most mekest
doctrine of the gospel: your prayer shall profit and do good, and he shall
enbrace and gladlye receive so well wyshyng geastes: that if they do not so
receive and welcome you, yet leate it not repent you, so to have prayed for
them. For you shall not lose the reward of this your proffered service, nor ye
shall not with ouermuche entreatyng nor castyng your selves at the knees of any
man require lodgeyng, nor shall not as men without shame press into the house
of any of them: for so great a thing and so much to be esteemed is not to be
offered and thruste into the hands of such, as will not gladlye receive it,
and yet ought it to be proffered to every man. Whosoever shall gladly and
willyngly receive you, see that you tarry with him, not desiryng or lokyng for
the pleasures of this life: but forsomuche as shall be necessary for the
susteinaunce of your bodies, drink, and feed on such things as ye shall
therefinde amongst them, for it is good reason yt he which labors in
preaching and teaching the gospel, should live and be sustained by their
liberality, for whose behoufe he labors and takes peine, in case he have
not sufficient of his own whereof to find himself.

And of this thing take ye diligent head also, lest ye straighing from house to
house, despisyng and setting at naught the former hospitality and lodgeing,
search and seek a more delicate lodgeyng and better furnished. And heal the
sick^.
Leate it suffice you, whatsoever comes first to hand: that if it shall
chance you to come into any cities, if the enhabitauntes willingly receive and
entreteine you, eat you and drink you without any choice, and without
lothyng or abhorring of any thing whatsoever is set before you, and to the
end ye may be geastes the more acceptable and the better welcome, and also
that ye may with the better credence preach the kingdom of heaven, heal you
the sick folks of the same city, restore ye the weak and impotente to their
strength, deliver ye such as are possessed with eiuill spirits. And all
these things do ye freely without reward, and willyngly, refusing no creature
neither poor ne rich: and than say ye unto them: ye see manifest tokens of
the power of God, prepare your hertes and minds to the earneste exercise of
innocente living. And say unto them: the kingdom of God is come.
For now draws nere unto you the kingdom of God: the maladies and diseases
of the body are now taken away, and ere long, shall the maladies of the
soul be driven away also (which are sins.) That if ye shall chance to
come into any city in the which there is none that will receive you, make ye
no kind of humble suite unto them for any intreteinme^t, but come you forth
abroad into their streets, and there openly and in the face of the whole city,
say ye unto them in this wise: We have freelye without any hope of reward at
your hands, offreed unto you the glad tidings of everlasting life. But
forasmuch as ye have despised and not regarded our office, we will take no
benefit at all by you.

Behold therefore, even the veraie dust which stuck unto our feet, we shake
and cast of against you, for a witness that we have proffered, and ye forsaken
that most happy tidings, which ought not to be laid in the lappes of such
as will none of it. And yet this thing be you tyght sure of, that whether ye
receive it or not receive it, the kingdom of God is verai nere upon you, that
if ye will receive this tidings, then shall it come to your great profit and
commoditee, if not, to your great hurt and destruction. Be ye content this
way only to have revenged your selfs.

If they shall any where despise you, vengeance shall light upon them for it at
the due time. For this thing verailye I show unto you, that in the day of the
last judgment, it shall be the better with the zodomites and they shall find
more grace at the Lords hand, It shall be easier in y^ day for zodome.
then that city which has despised this so great gracious goodness of God
freely offered unto them. All men do much marvel at the sharp and
rigorous vengeance of God showed upon the zodomites, but yet does this
poyncte somewhat ease them, that they were never so many ways provoked to
emendemente of their lives. And the Jews standing much in their own
conceiptes do vttrelye abhorte and deteste the veraie name and remembrance of
the said zodomites, whom the wrath of God by a terrible exaumple and
presidente for men to beeware by, did utterly destroy, but a more horrible
and dredefull punishment abides the same Jews, if they being stirred and
provoked with so many benefits, and so many miracles, shall neglecte and
despise the goodness of God.

Woe be to thee Corazain, woe be to the Bethsaida, cities of Israel. For if
the miracles, which have been showed in you, had been showed in the cities of
the Gentiles Tyrus and Sidon, which ye cry fie upon, accoumptyng them
abominable: they would have called themselfes home to emendement, yea and
sittyng in heareclothe and ashes, they would have dooen penance for their
sins, whereas ye being veraye styffe necked against God, do stand highly
in your own conceiptes, and think your selfs faultlesse. Woe be to the
Capernaum, which swellyng now in pride of richesse, and swimming in the
delices of sensuality, And y^ Capernaum which are exalted to heaven. etc.
appearest to be exalted above the moon as high as heaven, on that day shalt
thou be cast down even unto the diepe pit of hell.

For albeit ye be homelye and low messagiers, yet for that you shall come unto
them in my name, and shall show unto them the inestimable gift of God: the
condemnacion of such as shall despise you, shall not be small. For he that
hears you, hears me, which speak unto them by the instrument of your
mouths: And he that despises you despises me.
and contraryewyse, he that despises you despises me, and he that despises
me, despises him that has sent me. For I do not of mine own head any
thing speak, which I have not received first of my father, nor ye shall
speak nothing, which ye shall not first have learned of me. Therefore as my
doctrine is the doctrine of my father and not mine, so your preaching shall
be my preaching and not yours,

The lord Jesus when he had with such words as these, duelye enstructed and
armed the threscore and ten disciples, he sent them forth to assaye and
prove themselfes, how well they could do in preaching of the gospel. And
when the matter had woondrefullye well prospered in their hands, they returned
home again with great mirth and joy, saying: Master not only diseases are
driven away by us, but unclean spirits also are subject unto us in ye name
of thee. Then Jesus to arm and fense their minds against the disease of
vainglorie (which vleth by stealth to crepe and enter, And he said unto them: I
saw Satan, as it had been lighte^yng fall down from heaven. etc.
yea into holy me^ also) puts forth unto them the exaumple of Lucifer, who
for his pride was suddenly cast down from so great felicity. I saw (quod he)
Satan fall out from heaven even like the lightening. Great was his dignity in
heaven, and yet for that he was puffed up with pride, suddenly was he cast from
the higheste place in heaven, into the botome of hell pit. How much more
than ought you to beware of pride, which carrye about with you a mortal
body subject to all perilles and daungiers here in earth. Great is the power
which I have given you, but I have given it you not to any such intent, y^ ye
should thereby wear proud and high minded: but to the end y^ by your miracles
men should give and attribute greater faith and belefe to the gospel. I do
not require at your hands again, that which I have ons given you, so that ye
will not abuse it. For I give you power, by the which you shall trede serpents
and scorpions under your foot: yea and if there be any other thing by mean
whereof Satan your enemy may be hable to hurt you. Not one of all such
things shall have power to do you hurt: And yet is it not expediente for you to
glory o^ to vaunt your selfs concerning any such thing, Rejoice ye not that
spirits are subdued unto you. etc^
because spirits are subject to you. For these things shall be dooen also by
wicked and evil men: but rejoice ye in this thing, that your names are
already written in heaven: for thither shall your meekness and lowelinesse,
thither shall your simplicity bring you, from whens Lucifer through his pride
and haultenesse of mind fell, if ye shall still persiste and continue in this
your entente and purpose.

And when the lord had said these words, byanby he began to re^oyce in
the holy ghost, and to give thanks to his father for the prosperous success
of the gospel: teaching us even at the same time by exaumple of himself, that
in case any thing come luckilye to pass through our hands when we go about
it, we should rejoice, not with any human affeccion, but with spiritual and
ghostely rejoicing: not taking to our selfs any part of ye praise or glory,
but evermore reioycyng that the glory of god is so set forth and magnified:
and reioycyng at the profit of our neighbor. I render thanks (says he)
unto thee, o lord and father, the maker of heaven and ye^rth, for that these so
high things, thou have kept secret and hidden from such as after the world
are reputed wise and politic, and have opened the same to the litell tender
ones, to the inferior mean sort, to the ignorauntes, and to such as after
the judgment of the world, have no great wit nor experience. And thus
veraily is it dooen, o father, for that it has so pleased thy eternal
providence and wisdom, that the proud men being rejected and cast down, thou
might by such lowenesse exalt and lift up men to the true height of
heavenly things. Even so father. For so pleased it thee.
There is no power ne autoritee which my father has not delivered into my
hands: and therefore fear ye not the world, being right well assured that ye
have a master hable to defend you. For an eguall feloweshyp of all things is
between my father and me: and truly no man knows the son, who he is, and
how great he is, saving only the father which begatte him: nor no man
knows the father, who he is, and how great he is, but only the son borne
of him, and such as it may please the son to open it unto. He opens and
shows him to none but to such as be humble, meke spirited, and inclined or
apt to believe. Afterward turnyng himself to his disciples, he declared
himself to be very glad that they had the blissful hap, which had been
denied to men even of very high dignity, saying: Blessed are ye iyes which
see the things that ye see, for this I tell you for a thing of certaintye:
that many prophets and kings would feign have seen, that ye poor and abject
persons do see, and yet they have not seen it: and to hear these things
which ye hear, and they heard them not. See ye acknowlage and take to you
your good hap, but flee ye the taking of any pride or presumpcion thereby.
Take ye such a pride as may stand with holiness (that is to wete) a pride
against all things, which this world does gase upon for meruail, taking
them for high things, whereas they are but small trifles, and veraye
filthynesse in comparison of the things that are given unto you.

And on a certain day when Jesus disputing with the Jews had put the
Sadducees to silence, who in the way of prouyng him, had put forth a
question of a woman having been married to seven soondrye housebandes, which
of all these should have her at the day of the general resurrection, there
came unto him one of the Scribes well seen in the law, as one that would
put forth a question out of the diepeste and most profounde knowelage of the
law, and said: Master which is the chiefeste commandment of God, by
keeping whereof I may atteigne everlasting life? Jesus answered. That thing
which thou demaundeste of me, the same should other men have learned of thee.
For thou dooest profess the knowelage of the law. What is there written? and
how do thou read, that is there written? Than made he answer: Thou shall
love the lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, with all thy
power, What is written in y^ law? etc.
with all thy mind, because he cannot be loved enoughe: and next after him
thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self. Jesus allowying his answer, said
in this wise: Thou knoweste what is best: there remains nothing but that
thou put in ure and daily practice that thou doeste understand, which thing
if thou so do in fact and deed, thou shall live. For it is not the knowelage
that geuethe life, but the keeping and dooyng of the law. The Pharisee being
somewhat touched with the answer of our Lord, for that he knew the words
of the law and did not keep that which was the chiefeste point in the
law: yet because he was puffed up with vain glory he would not acknowelage
his own fault, but even as though he had now already at large fulfilled
the commandment of loving God, he moved a new question of his neighbor,
saying: Who is my neighbor? as though a man might love GOD, Who is my
neighbor?
and yet nevertheless be cruel and hurtefull to his neighbor. The Jews did
in manier interpret the name of neighbor to extend no ferther but to men of
their own nacio^, supposyng that it was lawful for them to hate alienes and
foreinours, and to leate them alone without dooeyng them any benefit or
good at all. Jesus therefore knowing the Pharisees mind answers him by a
parable here ensuwyng, painctyng out all the whole matter and setting it
before the iye by a certain mystical exaumple or representacion of the thing,
and teaching that the precepte of loving the neighbor ought not to be
enclosed within so narowe and streighte bounds of kynred and countreye, but
the same to enlarge and extend it self to a more ferther coumpace, that is to
wete, unto all men, forasmuch as oftentimes it chances that he which is
nighest to us in birth or countreye, is ferther from us in affeccion and love
then our veraye foe. A certain man fell among thieves. etc.
A certain man (says Jesus) taking his journey from Jerusalem to Hierico,
chanced to light on a counpaignie of thieves, who not being contented ne
thinkyng it enoughe to spoil the poor soul, and to turn him out of his
clothes, but moreover geuyng him soondrye wounds, they left him by the high
ways side half for dead, and there to perish out right, if no man had helped
him: and this done themselfes went their ways. And it chanced that a certain
priest was going a journey which lay the veraye same way, and whereas for
the veraye order and profession of priestehoode, which he had taken him unto,
he ought chieflye above others to have fulfilled the commandment of God: yet
notwithstanding himself being a Jew, saw one that was a Jew, and being
himself a man of Jerusalem, saw one of Jerusalem spoiled, wounded, and liyng
half for dead, and yet passed by no whyt moved with any drop of piety or
compassion.

After all this it chanced a certain Leuite to pass by the same way, at whose
hand a man might iustelye have looked for the due obseruyng and keeping of
gods commandment, for that he being a man dedicated to the temple, was
a ministre of gods holy service, and therefore ought to have been a man of
devotion. And this man even as the other had dooen, though he saw the
wounded man well enough, yet passed forth on his way, and did no help at all
to his brother and countreyman of the same city that himself, was of.

After both these it happened that a certain Samaritane passing the same way
on a journey that he had to go, espied the man that had been robbed, and lay
half alive, half dead: and meruailyng what the matter was, he drew nere
unto him, and perceiuyng the extreme mysfortune of the man, was moved with
pietye and compassion toward this Jew, whereas himself was a Samaritane, and
yet the Jews do veraie sore abhor and hate al Samaritanes. Nor he did not
only take pietye on him, but also, (the hindraunce of his journey nothing
passed on) he went unto him, and poured wine and oil into his wounds, and
than bound them up. And not thinkyng enoughe to have played him such a kind
part, he took and set him on the same beast, that himself rode on, and
carried him to an ynne, and there made provision that he should be
diligentely attended and looked unto, for that his iourneye required such
haste that he could no longer tarry, he drew forth two pieces of silver
coin which they called denaries, amountyng (as is before said) to a couple of
shillynges sterlyng or thereaboute, and delivered them to his host the ynne
keeper, that he should see the wounded man well attended and kept, until such
time as his journey being dooen, he should return the same way back again,
saying: Mine host ye have money for the purpose, see to this man at my cost
and charge. That if ye shall bestow any thing above this sum that I have
delivered you, ye for your part shall not be a loser of a mite by it, rekon it
to me when I return again this way, and whatsoever ye lay out upon him I
shall pay it you again. When our Lord had all this spoken, he said unto the
lawier: Which of these three seem unto thee to be neigh boure unto the party
that had fallen into the hands of the thieves? then answered the lawier. He
which being moved with pietye did coumforte and help him in his distress.

Then said Jesus ferther: and in this point also have thou made a right
answer and a true, see thy life be like and aunswerable unto thy words,
and be thou willing rather to be like to the Samaritane, then to the pryeste,
or the Leuite. With this parable the lord Jesus reproved and checked the pride
of the Jews, which thought themselfes enoughe and enoughe again to love God,
because they were good church me^ and daily goers to his temple, because they
killed beasts in sacrifice unto him, because they carried his commandments
about with them written in the skirtes of their garments, because they had
God, and the lord, evermore in their mouth, whereas God does nothing pass on
such wurshippyng, but is more delited with the secret affeccion of the sincere
and pure mind. But toward the neighbor they felt no mocion at all of
charity, as men living to the behoufe of theymselfes, and no more, yea and also
repynyng at the welfare of them whom it had been their parts to help: that
if they did any good turn or pleasure, they did it not to any other persons,
then of their own fecte, whereas every one man ought to be neighbor to an
other, if the case at any time require help or succor. The priest and the
leuite by birth and nation, were neighbor to the wounded man, but the
Samaritane, where by birthe and kind he was his enemy, in charitee and love
became his neighbor. The religion of the Jews divides nation from nation:
But the gospel knows not such manyer diuersyties ne difference, but is
ever glad to profit and do good to all men, without respect or accepcion of
the person. As the lord himself came to save all creatures being called of
the Jews a Samaritane in the way of reproach at a time when it was: but the
vilainy of calling him by that word, does not offend all the universal
nations of the world, forasmuch as they find the thing that is comprised
under that name to be for their health and safegarde. For Samaritanus, among
the Syrians is as much to say as a keeper. And veraylye he was the true keeper
and shepehearde, which did suffer nothing of his to perish, whether they were
sickelye, bruised, or wandreyng about as straighes, but wished all men to
be partakers of the eternal life at least wise as much as in him lay. All
the universal progenye of mankind being through the malice of Satan spoiled
out of the clothing of innocencye, sore wounded with all kind of vice, cast
aside, destitute of healpe, half dead and even at the next door to
desperacion, Jesus cummyng down from heaven, vouchesalued to visit and see
them, and to the end he might the better help them by taking man's nature
on him, he came very nere to manne, both seeing, and being seen, hearing
and being heard, felyng and being felt, and having piety on our extreme
distress, he took up our sins and bear them on his own body, he did in
his own propre person suffer that we had deserved, and the same Jesus has
seen to the curyng of us, who never turned his face from any sinner were he
never so vile or abiecie, whereas the proud and disdeignefull priest passethe
by him even then geuyng up the ghost: whereas the Leuite neglects him,
biddyng God have mercy upon him, and so going forth on his way as he had
begone, left he should sustain some hindreaunce or damage in the things of
the world, while he helps his neighbor. And this Samaritane Jesus too,
has his hosts and inneholders, to whom he leaning the earth, and ascendyng
into heaven dooethe commit the wounded man to be well looked unto, promysyng
a reward in heaven, if through the abundance of charity they shall have
laid out any thing more then was commanded, for the healyng of the pieteous
body. And by these inneholders are to be understood the Apostles, and their
successors, by whom even at this day he does cure and healpe mankind, and
gathers the same from the violence of thieves into the hostrye of the church,
where the wounds of sin are healed. Therefore where by the doctrine of the
gospel, even our very enemy also must be loved, and whereas according to
the profession of the Phariseye, even the Samaritane is to be loved of the
Jew, if he doo^ him good: yet the Jews, who could perfeictlye say by rote
at their fingers ends: Thou shalt love thy God above all things, thou shalt
love thy neighbor as well as thine owneself, in the veraye own person of
Christ did break both those commandments at ons, being on the one part
reprochefull of their words against God, whose words they would not
believe, whose miracles they staundreously reported to be done by the power of
Beelzebub (for the father being veraye God, was in the son being veraye
God,) and on the other part they hated the neighbor which did them benefit:
for that they wroughte always to destruye and put him to death, who freely
brought health and salvation unto all creatures. And such an one has
fulfilled as well the one as the other of the commandments above rehearsed,
which does in Christ, both love god above al things, and man also having
most highly done for him as himself. For true it is that he is loved in his
members in whom sembleablye he is offended, when their weak conscience is
offended: and is put to open shame of the world, when they be put to
shame: and is put to death, when they be put to death.

With this Parable, when Jesus had taught how much they were to be loved,
who bestowyng their wholle time in thattendaunce of evangelical doctrine, have
none other care ne entente, but to learn of Jesus the doctrine of life,
whereof they may give part unto all persons, and also how greatly they are
to be loved, who forsakyng and leauyng all service that is to be done with the
body, do altogether attend such things as concern the soul: there was a
chance even there to be seen, by the which this documente and lesson may be
the better enpriented in our mind: for by such plain exaumples of
experience, the hertes of the gross and ignorant sort are the more piththily
and effectually framed. For when Jesus having void time of laisure from other
business, was walkyng up and down with his disciples, who having given over
all care of worldely matters attended only to the gospel and nothing else: As
they went
it fortuned that they entered into a certain little town. And there a certain
woman called Martha, received and entreteined him in her house. This woman had
a sistur called Marie. They had either of them eguall love toward the lord,
but their course of living was of two soondrye sorts. And a certain woman
called Martha received him into her house.
The exercise also of their devotion toward God was of two soondry sorts,
like as in one body there be soondrye uses of the lymmes, and in the body of
Jesus (which is the church) there be soondrye gifts of the spirit. For
Marye as ye would say making holy day from all business that was to be done
about the house, set herself down at our lord Jesus feet listenyng to his
talk, wherewith she was so ravished, that forgeattyng all other things, she
could not be plucked away from him. Contrariewyse, Martha being careful
about the prouydyng of the dinner, ran up and down, she was much unquiet, as
one having both her hands full and as buisye as could be, that no manier
point might be wantyng of all such things as belonged to the
sweteentreteinyng of the lord and of his disciples. It was one love toward
the lord that possessed them both: but it would not suffer Mary to be pulled
away from his fete: and it made Martha to destiere her up and down about the
house, and suffered not her to stand still by the lord. Thus did one and
the same zele force two sisturs unto doings of two soondrye sorts, whereas in
loving and making much of Jesus they did thoroughly accord. Lord do y^ not
care that my sistur has left me?
Notwythstandyng, Martha forasmuch as she was not hable, but to her great
pains, to do al things alone, which apperteined to the prepayryng of all
things in order as it should be, and saw her sistur like an holydaye woman
sittyng at the feet of Jesus, she made no querele of unkindness to her
sistur, whom she knew well enough could not be pulled away, but she half
blamed Jesus, who with such words as he spoke, kept her away from puttyng to
her helpyng hand being than requisite. Master (says she) do thou nothing
care that my sister suffers me to do all the service my self alone? Command
thou her therefore that she help me, orels I know she will not be plucked away
from thee, except thou bid her, so great is the sweetness of thy talk. But
yet in the mean time ye diner must be dressed, and I being but one sole
woman, am not able enough to do all that is to be dooen. At these words our
lord being delited with ye zele of does the women, does nor disallow the
diligence of Martha, nor chydeth her, when she murmured against her sister: but
yet sumwhat takes Mary's part, saying: O Martha, Martha, in deed thou art
tormented with carfulness of dressyng the diner, and art all unquiet and
drawn this way and that way about many things. But there is one thing above
all others necessary, which ought continually to be done, if it might be:
do thou make an end of thy busynes that thou have in hand, howsoever thy
prouidyng and making ready for us shall frame, Uerely one is needful.
we shall be contented with it. But Marie has chose^ to her a great deal the
better part, who having forgotten things requisite for the body, is
altogether occupied in such matters as do concern ye soul. Therefore it were
not reason that she should be plucked away from things of the principal best
sort which she has specially chosen, and to be thrust out to offices of
basser service. I do in very good part take this good love and zele of thy^r,
which now at this time prepares a repaste for me and my dysciples: but I am
more refreshed and better filled at their hands, which take into their souls
my words, that they may have salvation thereby. This is the meat which
does most singulerly feed me: Mari has chosen the good part, which shall
not be taken away from her.
and this is the drink wherewith I am refreshed. Whosoever is embus^ed with
prouidyng for things perteinyng to the body, is drawn many ways into
soondrie cares, and an end of all such points of taking pains shall at
such time cum, when through she apperyng of immortality, all necessities shall
cease, with which the wekenesse of man's nature is now in this present world
soondrie ways disquieted. But such an one has a great advantage and fordele,
who having cast of all such manner cares, is altogether ravished to things
heavenly, gatheryng himself together and restyng upon one thing. But the same
one is a thing of such nature, that it surmounteth all other things in
goodness: the felicity of which one thing shall not be taken away, but
shall be augmented at the time, when that which is imperfect shall be
abolyshed, and that that is perfect shall be opened. Neither is there in the
mean time any mourmouryng to be made against such persons, as though they
were altogether idle, who sitting still from all bodily services, do for such
respect and co^sideracion give attendaunce to heavenly doctrine, cleuyng fast
to my steps, being long in learning the thing that they may afterward teach
and thoroughly sendyng down into the bottom of the affeccions of their own
hearts the thing that they may afterward prescribe and enjoin unto others: to
the end they may thereby do good unto so much the greatter noumbre toward
the achiuyng of eternal salvation. And yet shall not such persons lack their
due reward neither, who according to the exaumple of thy dooyng now at this
time, do of a godly zele, after the rate of ye time, relieve the corporal
necessity of them that have the cause of the gospel in handelyng, and such
as feed the hungry, as clothe the naked, as visit the sick, as gooe to them
that lie in prison, as harbor strangers and them that lack lodgyng. All
these also shall be partakers of the reward of the gospel. But like as in
the body the iye which seems to be idle, does more good service, then the
hand being buisily occupied about soondry kinds of service: even so such as
do altogether give head unto those things which do most nerest concern and
touch the life everlasting, although they seem as holidayemenne, to repose
theymselfes from all corporal business: yet they do more good then the
others, because they do the thing most chiefly requisite to be done. Nor the
one must grutche not against the other, forasmuch as every one of the^
according to his gift which he has received of god, serves me in my me^bres.

The.xi. Chapter.

When the Lord Jesus had by this kind of representyng the matter, and by the
exaumple before going taught, that they did a great matter and a buisye, whosoever
did full and whole give attendaunce to the doctrine of the gospel, which
doctrine no person can sincerely handle, unless he shake himself of from al
desires and cares of this world: it remained that he should prescribe and a
point a tenor and form of praiyng also. For prayer is (as ye would say) the
most purest sacrifice of evangelical devotion, unto the which prayer Jesus
did oftentimes depart into places of solitary contemplacion, and enured his
disciples also unto the same. And prayer is thatsame secret methyng, through
which the mind and soul of man, being (as ye would say) carried up to heaven,
joins in talk with god, (all cares and fantastical imaginacions of earthly
things set apart.) In deed the Phariseis prayed both oftentimes and also long
together: but it was with sad droupyng countenaunces, and abroad where all
folks should see them. And John's disciples prayed also. Yea and the Samaritans
too prayed on their mountain. The religion of the heathen folks also had a
manner of praiyng after their fashion.

For as much therefore as neither all sorts of men had one manner of
praiyng, nor one manner things were asked of god in all folks prayers: the
Apostles are very desirous and fain to have a precise form and tenoure of
praying appointed unto them of Christ, which they ought to follow. Whereupon
when Jesus according to his accustomed wont had withdrawe^ himself with his
disciples from the resort of people into a solytary place for to pray: as
soon as he had finished his prayers, one of the noumbre of his disciples,
said unto him: Master, forasmuch as we are thy disciples, mete it is, that
we should do all things by thine appointment.

Teach us therefore a form of praiyng also, Lord teach us to pray.
like as John, when he lived taught his disciples how they should pray. Then
Jesus whereas he had in many words at soondrye times taught his discyples,
that the prayers of christians neither ought to be long, nor made for
ostentacion or vainglory, ne for all manner things as well one as another, he
appointed unto them a form of praiyng, such as hereunder follows: which
although it be common unto all persons, yet does it more justly and directly
appertain unto the mynisters and teachers of the gospel, who being, (as ye
would say) persons exempted from this world, bestow all their labor and
trauail in this only behalf, that the glory of god may be opened and renoumed
among the good, and his kingdom from day to day may more and more florishe in
strength and force, the kingdom of Satan utterly suppressed, and brought under
foot. And like as in heaven above, (from whence Lucifer with all his complyces
and confederacy was toumbled down headlong,) there is now no manner rebellion
against the will of God: so among the children of God being ordained to succeed
in the place of the angels that were cast out of heaven with Lucifer, all
things may be dooen after the will of their heavenly father. Also that he
feed his children with the bread of heavenly doctrine and grace, which may
make their souls iustie and full fed unto the life everlasting. And in case
any offense or trespace be thoroughe humayne frailty committed against his
will: that than he mercyfully forgive his children like a tender and frendely
father, as they among theymselfes forgive one another, if one have any thing
offended or trespaced against ye other.

And because that during the time of their life here in this mortal body,
like as they may profit and grow to better, so may they contraryewyse fall
unto wurse, (especially the tyraunte Satan by all means provoking and
s^irryng them so to do:) that they may under the tuicion and wardyng of their
heavenly father, be safely defended against Satan's engiens: and that either
they may not fall into te^ptacion, or if they do fall, than he being their
defendour, which is the stronger of might and puissaunce, they may depart
conquerours with they victory. As for the tenor of the words of praiyng is
this here following. Our father which art in heaven. etc
Our heavenly father, we being here set on earth who^ thy goodness has
vouchesalued to call by the name of children, we pray the, that through our
doctrine and living, thy power, thy wisdom, and thy goodness, may still more
and more cum to the knowlage of men, and that they may have understanding, that
all glory is due unto thy name, from whom proceeds all thing, whatsoever is
goodlye and honorable either in heaven, orels in earth, to the end that though
being basse and slendre on our own parties, yet in thee we may glory and
tryumphe: hitherto has Satan reigned all the world over through sin:
whereunto men have been as bondseruauntes being thereto allured and trained with
wicked lusts. Make thou, o father, that sins clean taken away, and thy holy
spirit poured out upon them, all creatures may be obedient to thy will, and
that thou every day bounteously geuyng unto us the heavenly food of thy grace,
we may from time to time grow forth to better and better, until we may cum
to the full perfeccion of euangelical godlynes. Furthermore for as much as men
we are, made of frail metal, in case through being in a wrong way by
ignorance, or thorough weakness and frailty, we shall any thing trespass
against thee, o father, cease not thou to be favorable to thy children: but
according to thy mercifulness forgive us, for as much as we do forgive one an
other, if the brother, thorough the same frailty do offend against the
brother, to the end that peace may be firmly established amongst our selfs,
And led us not into reptacion.
and that we may have peace with thee. And for because we know the malice of
thatsame evil tiranne, from whence thy fatherly goodness has redeemed us:
suffer us not to be eftsoon ouercummed of him: but and if thou suffer us for a
probacion of our patience to be afflicted either by him, or by his soldiers
wicked men, leat us through thy sure safeguard have the ouerhand of him, and
leat all his assaults turn to our benefit in the end.

But the better to stir his servants unto the instauntnesse of prayinge,
and besidesfoorth to put in them an assured trust to obtain, he added to the
premises, a parable of such sort as follows: how ientle (says he) and how
easy to be entreated, god is, being of nature beneficial and full of
lyberalytie toward his children, conjecture ye of your own selfs. If any one
of you be destitute of necessaries, and have a friend, he will be bold to go
unto him in the mids of the night, and familiarly knockyng at his doors, he
will be bold to say: Friend, lend me three loaves of bread. For so it is,
that a certain friend of mine taking my house in his way, has soodaynly cum
upon me unawares, even late in the euenyng to lodge with me all nigh^e, and I
have nothing at home in mine own house to set before him to eat. And
peradventure that same friend will not even byanby at the first word give the
thing that thou do ask, but being ill willing to open his doors, he will
answer within his house: Trouble me not cummyng to crave things after this
sort in the night time, my doors are now shut in for all night, and my
children are with me in bed, I cannot arise and give that thou requirest.
That if the party which lacks the loaves, go not his ways byanby at this
excuse making, but shall continue there still knockyng at his friends door, as
one that will have no nay of the thing that he cu^meth for, this I affirm unto
you although the respect of friendship do not move him, yet being ouercomed with
ye importunity of the party that makes such praiyng unto him, he will arise
out of his bed, and will give him not only three loaves, according to the tenor
of his peticion and askyng, but he will give him how many soever he shall have
need of. If importunity of praiyng be of such force and effect at one
mortal man's hand to the behoufe of an other man: how much more than shall
it take place and effect with God, who is much delited with such manner
importunity, and not offended? And in case he at any time make delay to give
that is asked, niggardeshippe is not the cause thereof, nor yet his hardenesse
that he will not be entreated: but therein he enkiendleth our desire, that he
may the more plenteously give that we ask, and we on our parties, may the
more derely esteem and love the thing that has been obtained by importune
prayers. The Same therefore that a friend being in need would do with his
friend being a mortal man, the same leat every one of you much more be bold
to do toward God being a bounteous and liberal father, whom such
importunity does well content, and who can never be undone or made poor by
geuyng. Of him therefore ask ye with hertie prayers from the botome of the
heart, Seek, and ye shall find. etc.
in case ye need any thing, and it shall be given you. If ye be ignorant in
any thing, make ye due inquisicion for it, and through the secret workyng of
your fathers spirit in you, ye shall find out the thing, which by man's
wit could not possibly have been perceived. Knockeye with prayer, ioynyng
thereunto almesdedes toward the neighbors, and it shall be opened unto you.
This is the importunity wherewithal god is (as ye might say) ouerco^med, and
even by plain force won to your peticions, that he cannot say you nay, even
as a castle or fortress is woonne by force of arms. Praying is with man
oftentimes made all in vain: either because he can not perform that is
asked, or else because he will not. But at gods hand whosoever asks, does
receive: whosoever seeks does find: and whosoever knocks, to him it is
opened. And your father best knows what things are auaillable toward
eternal salvation, and the same things does he with glad will freely give, if
he be prayed: insomuche, that if through your being in a wrong opinion, or in
an error of judgment he were asked things hurtefull: he would rekon it as a
benefit toward you, to deny unto you that was naughtly sued for: but instead of the thing ye wyshed, he would give that might be for your wealth.

The natural affeccion of carnal parents toward their children, does so
work, that they cannot say nay unto them whom they have begotten, if
the same should make peticion for a thing perteynyng to the health of the
body. Makeye a conjecture by comparison of your own selves. For who is it of
you all, that in case he should ask a piece of bread of his father, can
suppose, that the same would give his son a stone instead of a piece of
bread? or in case he should ask fish, can think that the father would offer
his son a serpent instead of a fish? or, in case he should desire to have
an egg, can rekon that the father instead of an egg would give him a
Scorpion hidden in an egshell? That if the tender love and affeccion of nature
be of so great force and strength among men, (being many other ways naughty
persons,) that toward their children askyng things profitable, they are
friendly geuers: how much more your heavenly father, who is the father of
spirits, and who of nature is good, will give unto you from heaven, his
spirit being good, which shall aboundauntely give you all goodness if ye
shall make peticion to him for it?

And he was casting out a devil, and the same was dumme. And when he had cast
out the de^^ill, the dumme spoke, and the people woondred. But some of them
said: he casts out deuilles, through Beelzebub the chiefest of the devils.
And other tempted him, and required of him a sign from heaven. But he knowing
their thoughts, said unto them: Every kingdom divided against it self, is
desolate: and one house does fall upon another. If Satan also, be divided
against himself, how shall his kingdom endure? Because ye say, that I cast
out devils through Beelzebub. If I by the help of Beelzebub cast out devils,
by whose help do your children cast them out? Therefore shall they be your
judges. But if I with the fy^ger of God cast out deiuils, no doubt the
kingdom of God is come upon you. When a strong man armed watches his house,
the things that he possesses are in peace. But when a stronger then he
comes upon him and overcomes him, he takes from him al his harness
(wherein he trusted) and divides his goods. He that is not with me, is against
me. And h^ that gathers not with me, scatters abroad. Satan also has a
spirit of his own, whom he enspireth to all his servants, to be a prouoker
and a mouer of them to all naughtiness. Yea and the world too, has a spirit
belongyng to it, which allureth men to the love of things transitory. But
with this spirit, your heavenly fathers spirit has no manier entremedlyng at
all. If therefore the spirit of your heavenly father shall dwell in you, the
spirit of Satan must be expoulsed: and the one spirit must needs avoid out,
for to make room that the other may come and inhabit in your breasts. And
behold a chance that might lay manifestlye before their iyes, what thing the
evil spirit wrought in the hertes of the Jews, being evermore wrastlers
against the holy spirit of God. There was brought unto Jesus a certain man,
possessed with a mischievous devil: and it was a devil, not of one sort
only, but both a dumme deiuill, and also a blind, so that he could neither
look up upon Jesus, nor yet speak unto him. Tha^ Jesus of his own accord
taking piety on the man being in such affliccion, commanded the devil to
void out of him, and he voyded. And behold there were certain Jews present
standing by, whose souls the spirit of Satan did more daungierfully possess,
He casts out deiuils through Beelzebub.
then that same unclean spirit had possessed the body of this man. For some of
them slanderously said, that the miracle had been done of the deiuill,
allegyng, that Jesus did such things not by the power of God, but by the
help of Beelzebub the prince of deiuils. Some others again after seeing so
many miracles, yet still remaining in unbelief, required of him some notable
token from heaven, whereby it might evidently appear that he had familiarity
with God, who dwells in heaven, and not with unclean spirits, whose blindyng
of men's iyes, does commonly spryng from the earth. And this did they speak
temptyng the lord, never a whitte the more myndyng to believe on him, although
he had done ye thing that they required: but whether he had done it or not done
it, they had surmised a matier or slaundre one or other ready to obiecte
against him. But Jesus, as soon as he saw their ungodly thoughts, made
answer to their wi^ked surmises in such sort as follows: How does your
slaundreous reprouyng of me stand together? We see that no kingdom is hable
to stand, if it be at strife within it self by civil discord of one of the
same realm against another. Every kingdom divided against it self. etc.
Which thing if it so be, it cannot be chosen but that it must come to
desolacion, and one house to fall down upon another by an universal ruin.
That if the thing be true, which ye think, that through the maintenance
and aid of Beelzebub prince of deiuils, I do cast out hurtefull spirits,
who veraily be his fellows and soldiers: than it follows as a true
conclusion, that eiuill spirits being at variaunce within theymselfes, do
fight together, and one of them to be chaced away by an other. Now if Satan
fight against Satan, how shall his kingdom stand? Ye see devils to be cast
out, and ye grant that evil they be whom I do cast out: on what ground
than do ye conjecture these things to be dooen by the supportacion of
Beelzebub, rather then of god? Is Beelzebub wont to do for the health and
safegarde of men, and to chase his soldiers out of their possessions, by whom
he exercises his tirannie? And yet if this be dooen, it argues and proves
that the kingdom of Satan shall shortly be destroyed, and the kingdom of
God to be now at hand. I cast out devils with a mere word: I cast them
out freely: I use thereunto no charmyng words of witchecraft, ne of iugleyng
or blyndyng men's iyes. The act ye cannot disprove: why than have ye more
mind to refer the glory of a good work to Beelzebub, the^ to god? Than if
the hatered, which ye bear unto me does persuade you, that I cast out
devils by the aid of Beelzebub: these young men being your own sons whom
ye have seen doing the selfsame thing, by whose help do they chase away
devils? Plain homely men they be, they are men of no knowlage ne authority,
they ca^ no skill of the malicious sleightes of witches or Nygromanciers: and
yet do these cast out devils in the name of me. What thing they do, they do
it on a faithful trust in God: and therefore shall your unbelief be condemned
by these judges and none other. The plain simpleness of these has believed,
whereas your wisdom and expert knowelage of the world, strives against the
glory of god. Whereupon seeing there is neither ryme ne reason in saying that
one evil spirit drives out an other evil spirit, and forasmuch as your
children do cast out devils by the help of none other then by whose help I do
cast the^ out: it is clear that I do cast out evil spirits by ye virtue and
power of god, who is good. For the spirit of him is of more power and might
the^ all the whole pack of the wicked spirits yt are. Neither is there any
agreement between the spirit of god, and the^. For god loves ye preseruacio^
of mankind, and they seek the destruction of the same. Now than, if it be a
thing manifest that the things which ye see me do, I do by the power of
god: than is there no doubt, but that the kingdom of god is cum unto you,
which John did preach to be at hand. Reason it is therefore that ye join
your selfs with him, and withdraw you from the reign of Satan, which shall
shortly have an end. Ye cannot be partakers of both kingdoms at once: there
is between god and Satan a bataill that by no possibylitye may be brought to
attoneme^t. The cause will never by any conditions be brought to agreement. Satan
shall either geat the victory, orels by strong hand be driven out, he shall
not by yeldyng or submyttyng himself continue in his reign, ne yet be
received upon any conditions of agreement appointed unto him. He has hitherto
reigned without redress: but now is there cum a power more puissaunt and
mighty the^ his tirannie. For one finger of God is more mighty to preserve and
save mankind, tha^ all ye hosts of Beelzebub to destroy the same. The Same thing
therefore shall in this behalf cum to pass which is commonly wont to chance
between two head captayns, both being valiant, and strong, and both being
fierce and courageous, and such as al their affiaunce and trust rests in
their armor and weapon. For when a man of great forte and puissaunce being in
armor does keep his fortress, the things that be in his possession, are
in peaceable rest and quite. That if any other being of more power the^ he, do
set upon him, and do with plain force of arms co^quere him that was in harnes
well armed, he will enter no leage of fellowship to be as half partener with him
in his castle, but dryuyng the other quite away, he will enter upon full
possession of the wholle house himself. The weapon wherein the other trusted,
he will by plain force take away from him, all his richesse and substance he
will rifle and spoil, and distribute it among his soldiers. Now does it
behoue you to look about you, and see of whether side ye will be, and with
whether ye will take part, with God being the mightier, or with Satananon to
be driven out. If ye have peace with Satan, ye are out with God. If ye have
peace with god, than cannot ye and Satan agree. And in the one or the others
camp must ye fight. The time as it now shapeth, will not suffer any persons to
sit idle. And whosoever is not on my side, is an adversary unto me, and even in
this very point does me hurt and s^athe, because that where he ought of
duty to favor my side, he does not favor me: and whosoever does not gather with
me, scatters abroad.

And because the Jews took upon them an opinion of righteousenesse, and upon
boldness thereof, did either negligently leat slip the doctrine of the
gospel, orels did utterly refuse it, and would none of it, he put forth a
derke parable whereby to signify, that a more grievous damnation should light
on such persons, as when they have gone a litel way foreward toward
righteousness, did fall back again to their old enormities, then on such as
never knowing ye light of euangelical truth, had continued still in the
derkenesse of their sinful living. For ye people of the Jews was disseuered
by mean of the law, from the Gentiles being Idolaters: but falling every
other day of freashe to their former transgressions, they were cum at length to
such degree of ungodliness, that whatsoever offense their forefathers had
done in putting the prophets to death, or in conspiryng against Moses, the same
did they seuenfolde double more ungraciously renew against the son of God,
and against his disciples. Albeit this parable does ferther also touch every
man, who being once washed from his former sins through baptism, once
delivered from the evil spirit of this world, by the word of the gospel,
does negligently use the gift of god, nor takes any care to proceed from
time to time, to ferther degrees of perfeccion. Unto such an one being
walowed down again to his former living, baptism, and ye knowlage of holy
doctrine shall avail to none other effect or purpose, but yt he shall of his
own sekyng have the sorer damnacion at the day of judgment, as one the which
to his former sweruyng out of the right way, has joined unthankfulness, and
maliciousness also. Now of the parable this is the tenor here following.

When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man. etc
When an unclean spyrite is once departed out of a man, being put away by
the power of God, for as much as he has an obstinate will to do hurt, he
goes walkyng up and down by places barain and waterlesse seeking rest. And
when he could no where find the same, he says within himself. I will return
back into my house that I came out of. And returning unto the same, he found
it in deed sweped clean with bromes, but altogether empty. Wha^ he espieth
that, he goes his way and takes unto him seven other spirits, more
ungracious tben himself ever was, and with such a knotte of company goes he
again to his house, in deed made clean, but leaft unkept, nor armed with any
defense of virtues semyng for the gospel. For the ornaments and garnishyng of
ceremonies, in deed make outwardlye a show or semblaunce of godliness: but
because they are only certain vain counterfaites of things, they keep not
away the assaults of wicked spirits, but rather are an occasion of a ferther
ungodliness. And even so does it chance unto thatsame man, who being cleansed
from one ill spirit, is made subject unto seven that are every one of them
wurse then he.

While Jesus was speaking this and a great deal more unto the people of al
sorts, a certain woman, meruailyng at his words being so wise and so piththy
as they were, liftyng up her voice among all the cu^pany, said: blessed is the
womb of thatsame woman which bare the, and blessed are ye pappes of thy
nourice which thou did suck. The voice of this woman was pronounced against
ye synagogue of the Jews being evermore a slanderous maligner against
Christ, and the woman bears the figure of the church. Wherefore Jesus does
not deny her testimony and preachi^g, but makes it perfect, saying: Forsooth
blessed they are, which hear the word of god, and keep the same in their heart,
that it run not out, but tarry until it may one day bring forth fruit of
everlasting salvation. Thatsame is a much more blessed thing, than it was for
the mother to have borne his body in hers, or to have nourced him with milk. One
woman might be hable to bear so great an one, or to give me suck. But this
blessedness may be a thing common to all creatures.

And when at the speaking of such words as these, the multitude of people
came still thicker and thicker rennyng thither: Jesus begone to make answer
unto them that had to fore required to have some notable sign showed unto
them from heaven, as though the things which Jesus had hitherto dooen, were
but basse and low matters, nor did contain in them any point at all semyng
for a great prophet: and for that the same were done for the common inferior
sort: but they thought that unto the Pharyseys for their parts, as men of
learning, and of an higher degree far above the rate of the common multitude,
it were mete to show some special matter of woondre, even purposely and
specially for them. And this did they speak not of an unfeigned mind, menyng
any good faith therein: but to tempte and prove him, to the intent that if he
showed none, they might find cauillacions, that all the rest of his miracles
had been done by the help and mainteynaunce of Beelzebub, on the other side,
if he showed any, that than they might find su^ other matter in him, whereof
falsely to accuse him, and to lay to his charge. Jesus therefore said: This
same is an evil generation, and of none vpryght ne plain meaning, where they
have already seen so many miracles doe^, they require yet sum ferther strange
toke^, not whereunto to give credit, but which they may slanderously report:
but the thing which they do ask in ye way of fraud and guyle, they shall not
obteyn, but they shall receive a sign such an one as they are woorthye. They
shall not have given them, whereat to find surmised cauillacions, but they
shall have given them, that may convince their malice and infidelity. For
there shall be given unto them the sign of Jonas the prophet. At the preaching
of Jonas, the Ninevites did repent and refourme their manifold ungraciousness,
when the same Jonas had showed no miracle amongst them: but this nation can by
no miracles, ne by no benefits be brought to soften their hertes to
repentance. And yet is there one present among them greatter than ever was the
prophet Jonas: which Jonas these folks do highly esteem, because the same
being in a whales mouth in the sea, lived there three days and three nyghtes,
and after all that, when he was esteemed and reputed for dead, suddenly appeared
alive. A like matter hereunto, but yet much more wonderful, and more above the
course of nature shall it be, that the soonne of man being dead in deed, shall
lie three days buried in the heart of the earth: and yet contrary to the
lokyng of all evil persons, the earth shall yield him again a liuesma^ on the
third day, whom it received dead. Wherefore at the last judgment, this nation,
who now despises all others in comparison of theymselfes, and who think
theimselfes to sit even in the high topcastell of true seruyng of God, shall
be condemned of many nations, which were thought to be toto far out of
the way from all godly devotion. The queen of Saba shall arise at the judgment
with the me^ of this nation, and shall condemn them, because that she being
a woman, and having nothing to do with the doctrine of the law, yet came a
great long journey from the ferthest parts of the world to Jerusalem, of
purpose to hear the wisdom of Solomon. And yet even now herein this place
there is a greatter matter than ever was Solomon: and yet is the thing set at
naught that is now present here. The Ninevites being folks without any
knowlage of the law, and wurshippers of Idolles, shall stand in trial with
this nation at the judgment, and shall condemn them, because they did repent
and amend their abominacions, at the preaching of a man unknown unto them and
an aliene borne, and with no miracles, ne with no benefits showing any cause
in himself, why he should be so much regarded. And behold, here is now
present a greatter matter than ever was Jonas: and yet are they nothing moved
to amendment.

Now although many there were among the Jews, whose hertes by reason of their
own wilful and stubburne maliciousness, the light of the ghospel did make
more blind then they were before: yet the truth ought not from hens forth to
be suppressed, forasmuch as the knowlage thereof should bring veraie many to
eternal salvation. For the obstinate malice of unbelievers must not be any
let or hindreaunce to the good. Wherefore the truth must be brought to open
light, to the more horrible grievous damnacion of the eiuill persons and to
the salvation of the good sort. No body lights a ca^dle (faith he) and
hides it in apriuie derke corner, or covers it by whelmyng a busshell over
it: When the iye is single all the body also shall be full of light
but sets it in a candelsticke, that it may give light to such as are
wyllyng to enter into the house. The Same that the house is without a candle,
the same that the body is without iyes, even the same is ye soul without
knowlage of the truth, which comes by mere unfeigned feith: If thine iye be
single, and nothing perished ne infected with any other inordinate desires of
this world: it will receive the light of everlasting truth, and al thy body
shall have the fruicion of this light, in such wise, as it shall no where
stumble nor iutte against any thing. But in case the iye of thy body be
corrupted or bleamished, then shall all the whole body be entrieked, and ready
to take harm in the derke. For of feith comes judgment, and statutes or
ordeinaunces of good living. This is the fountain of all goodness, which if
it be putrified, it cannot be chosen, but that all the other things must be
corrupted also. See therefore that this iye wherewith the truth is seen, may
be pure in thee, and clear without any corrupcion, lest that the self membre,
which only is apt to receive light, and which only must show light to all the whole body, be encoumbred with derknesse. For the same thing being
infected, which is the head and ye root of all good works, even those verai
things which seem to be good, are not good: And contrariwyse, the things
which seem unto the Pharisees to be eiuill, shall not be evil, if the
fountain wherhence they do spryng forth be pure and clear from all
infeccion. What thing a candle is to an iye well clarifyed, even the like thing
is the word of God to the soul being well pourged through the singleness
of feith from naughty affeccions. Whatsoever proceeds not of feith is sin.
That if the iye of thy body shall be sincere and pure, as a thing made all
light with the candele of evangelical truth: than shall it give part of his
light unto all the members, so that there shall not be any derkenesse at all
in any part of the body: by reason that the iye shall look forth to the
behofe of all the members thereof. And so whatsoever thing the hand shall do,
it shall not be in any daungier of harm in the derke, but all the whole body
shall be lightsome, even as the whole house is lightsome, wha^ the brightness
of the candle gives his light all about.

And even immediately herupon there followed a matter, whereby the same that the
Lord had taught, might (as ye would say) be playinly declared. For the
phariseis forasmuch as they had an iye foul blemished, and setting
righteousness in ceremonies longyng to the body, they did wilfully leat slip
those things, which are not seen but with the pure clear iyes, unto whom the
candle of evangelical truth shows light: supposed the light to be there,
where derknesse was: and than did they stumble and run against things most
of all, when they thought theimselues to go gaily well upright: and they
judged there to be a grievous enormitie, where none at all was: and
contrariwise where a sore offense or transgression was, there wened they to be
none at all. For they had their iyes sore bleamished with the supersticion of
the law, with ignorance, with disdeineful pride, with envy, with couetise,
with hypocrisy, and with other naughty vices. Than a certain Pharisee prayed
Jesus, to come and dyne with him. Jesus made no refusal, as one that was ever
ready to offer himself unto every body, to the entente he might draw all
creatures unto him. And when the lord had set him down at the table without
washyng his hands before, (and that, contrary to the guyse of the Pharisees:)
this said Pharisee begoonne to meruail with himself secretly in his mind,
what the cause should be, why the Lord had not washed, before he satte down
to his meat. And even by an by of a thing which neither makes a man good nor
ill, there spryngeth a thing which is in veraye deed evermore ill. And as for
the Pharisaicall ceremonies, which consiste in things perteyning to the
body, have this property natural to them, and cummyng even of their veraye
kind, that they bread slanderous backebityng, evil suspicions, perverse
judgments, variaunce, hatred, and much bralling. Jesus therefore well
knowing thissame to be ye chiefest corrupcion of evangelical godliness, did
sharply rebuke the Pharisaicall supersticion, saying: Moses did in old time
appoint certain ordinary constitucions, and customs of purifyng, which
nevertheless did conteyne a figure and representacion of pourgeyng and
clensyng the soul. For to this end it serves all that ever that same law did
derkely set forth in shadows. But as the time now is, where in consideracion
of the truth clearly apperyng forth, it is mete for those shadows of the
old law by little and little to vanish away, ye Phariseis, which profess the
perfect knowlage of the law, do enbrace thatsame part of the law only,
which is of least weight of all toward true godliness. And ye do not only
offend in this behalf, that ye enbrace the carnalitie of the law not passing
on the spirit of the law, but also by reason of carnal ceremonies added to
the law, and constitucions of your own making, ye will in any wise be reputed
to be of more holiness, then the very commandments of God. The purity
consists in the inculpablenesse and innocence of the heart. But as for ye do
every other while make much washyng of your body, ye wash the pottes and
cups that ye drink of, ye wash the platers and dishes that your meat is
served in, being but outward things, and nothing at al making to the true
godliness of the mind: and in ye mean time the innermore, and chieffer part
of you, being still unwashed is all full of filthynesse detestable before god,
that is to wete, rauine and iniquity. Ye believe your selves to be defoyled if
ye drink of an unwashed cup, or if ye eat out of an unwashed dishe: and yet
ye think your self pure and clean, if both your cup and your dishe to, yea
and all that is in them contained, have been gotten with rauine and with fraud.
O fools and me^ of a perverse judgment, did not he that made the body, make
also the soul? Than if pureness do so highly please you, it had been mete to
make all the whole man pure in every part of him. Did not he that made that
which is without? etc.
But it had been mete, to have provided first for that, that is the chieffer
part. But all this while ye flattre your selves as though ye were pure even in
the best sort, if on the one side ye do every other while wash your bodies
and your vessels, that ye eat and drink in, with a little water: and on the
other side if your heart being polluted with manyfold guyles, rauines hatred,
envy, desire of worldly promocion, and with other pestilent vices be purged
with almesdedes, which alms though ye do it but for a vainglorye and a show
only, yet ye think it to be sufficient for the vttermoste and highest
clensyng of the soul that can be. But woe unto you Pharisees, who under a
pretexte and color of seruyng God, work your own commodity, tithing even
the vilest and most common herbs* Myntes, and Rue, as though God cared for
no mo but priests and Levites only. give alms, and behold all things are
clean unto you.
And in the mean time contrary to the mind of God, ye deal guilefully with
your neighbor, and relieve not the nedie, but envy and grutche at them, which
have more wealth then yourselues, and the weak ye oppress. O a judgment in
veraie deed ouerthwarte and perverse. The things which the law has
appointed for a season to be kept after the fleashe, in deed it had been your
parts not to leave undone: but tho things which God would most chiefly of
all to be done, which are evermore good, and acceptable unto him, outh first
and most principally to have been done. Such things as concern your own
commodity, ye do even scrupulously look unto: but the things that concern
helpyng of the neighbor, ye pass nothing on.

Woe unto you Pharisees, who though ye outwardely bear a show of holiness,
yet nevertheless withinfoorth swell in ambicion, sekyng to have the higher
seats in the synagogues, and ye rejoice to hear such honorable tytles as
master, and masters, of such as bid you good morrow, and good eauen, in the
streets abroad, nothing else entendyng ne sekyng, but that ye may please the
iyes of me^, and estemyng it as a thing of nothing to displease the iyes of god
with the filthiness of the soul. Therefore woe unto you with your hypocrisy,
which are like unto dead men's toumbes, which shine and look smothe without
forth by reason of white work, with titles, and many soondrye pictures,
whereas withinfoorth they are full stuffed with all vnclenesse. But in the
mean time the thing that outwardly appears, shows fair to the iyes of
such as pass by, but the thing that they hide within them, is unseen.
Nevertheless men may be beguiled, but God can look into the most priuiest
corners of the heart. When the Lord with great sharpness spoke this and other
things against the cloked holiness of ye Pharisees, one of the lawiers being
desirous to bridle the plain speaking of Jesus, sayied unto him. While thou
speak this on ye Pharisees, thou do also reproach us. An heart yt knows
his conscience guilty, cannot abide plain speaking, but fears lest the
example of plain speaking against others may at last light upon himself. Woe
unto you^e lawiers, for ye lade men with burdens.


But Jesus being the everlasting truth, which can no skill of flattreing
(because the said truth, only is faultlesse and vnculpable, and yet never
chydeth but to emende that is a miss,) answered unto the lawier: If the
words which I speak touch you too, as thou acknowlegest: woe shall be unto
you lawiers also, who being not content to exact every triflyng obseruaunce
of the law, at the hands of the poor ignorauntes, do moreover besides the
authority of the law, add many points of your own, and heapyng burden upon
burden, ye lay upon the shoulders of the simple people a whole fardel
impossible to be borne, and in the mean while ye take your own pleasures to
the vttermoste, being to far from touching the things which ye lay on
other folks shoulders, that ye do not so much as keep those chief points
neither without which the rest do nothing.

Woe unto you, who for vainglorious bosting of your perfeccion, do build up
the toumbes of the Prophets where the most part of the same were slain of
your forefathers. For thereby comes it to pass, that even by the very same
thing, wherewith ye would most fainest cloak your maliciousness, ye do most
of all bewraye the same. For while ye garnyshe the sepulchers of the prophets,
ye grant that they were persons detestable, which were the kyllers of such
men, whose memory is high and holy among you that are their offspring. And
forasmuch as your own selves do toward the Prophets of this time, being
far superiors to the Prophets of times past, Ye bear witness y^ ye allow
the deeds of your fathers.
attempt wurse harms, then your auncetours committed against the Prophets of
old time, do ye not plainly declare, that being blinded with lucre, ambicion,
envy and hatred, ye do wetingly allow the wicked acts of your forefathers,
which acts of theyrs ye do not only follow, but also earnestly labor to
pass and to go beyond them? So often has the goodness of God called you
back to emendment: and at all times have ye wickedly showed more extreme
cruelty against them that laid the truth even in your lappes: which truth
was unto you for none other cause odious saving that it contraried your
naughty lusts and desires. Wherefore the wisdom of God, which ordreeth all
things by such providence as cannot in words be expressed, before it will
punish the obstinate malice of this nation, has determined to leave nothing
unassayed, whereby they may be converted to better ways. But after that
as well the botomelesse goodness of God, as also the perverseness of them not
possible to be woonne to goodness, shall once be declared to all creatures:
so much the more grievous torments shall they endure, how much the longer
space they have been suffered, and with how much greater benefits they have
been provoked and occasioned to repentance. Wherefore thus spoke the wisdom
of God within it self: what shall I do more then I have dooen to this vnrewly
nation? I sent Moses unto them. I sent many prophets of old time. I sent John
the Baptiste. Against Moses there was conspiracy wrought: the prophets every
one, they either slew orels plagued with affliccion: no nor Iho^ neither would
they not hear though he were more then a prophet: neither did he escape
scotfree for giving good advertisement. The son of man is come: and to him do
they work destruction and death. I shall hereafter send unto them the last
prophets of all, who shall ghostely expound the law unto them: I shall send
the apostles, that shall have great virtue in workyng miracles, that shall
freely do good to all people, that shall bring unto al folks salvation, with
excedi^g small charge to be bought, that is to wete, with faith. And yet will
they not hear these neither, but will persecute them, torment the^, drive them
away, yea and sum of them will they slay: so far shall their malice excede
the goodness of god. At last, wha^ their malice shall be so far grown, that
they shall not only match, but also excede and pass the abominacions of all
ages past, than shall the vengeance of God fall sodaynely upon them, and than
shall be required at their hands the blood of all the prophets, which has
been shed sens the first creacio^ of the world, that is to wete, from ye blood
of Abell, (who was first of all men slain by his brother Cain being envious
against him) unto the blood of Zachary, the priest, son of Ioas, Gene.
iiii.ii. Paralip. xxiiii.
who calling back the people to better advised ways, was stoned to death by
sedicion of the people, between the temple and the aultare. And the said
zachary even at the momente when he departed from this life, both testifiyng
his own innocence, and their wickedness, said: The Lord see this and require
it. And even now approaches the time of this vengeance. One nation shall, as
ye would say, be punished for all the heinous deeds of their forefathers,
because it has gone beyond all the malice that ever has reigned in them all.
It shall cum to pass undoubtedly, that the wisdom of god has said before
shall cum to pass. The Jews of these days, because they excede the
rebellion, the perverseness, and the cruelty of all that in old time have
been, shall in such grievous sort be punished, as though they alone had
accomplyshed and dooen all the ill parts that ever their ancestors have in
soondrie ages wickedly played.

Woe unto you lawiers, and woe again, who openly professyng the knowelage of
the law which is ghostly, and taking into your hands, as due unto you the
keys of science and cunning, which ought to have opened a way into the
kingdom of heaven: Ye enter not in your selves, and them that came in, ye
forbad.
yet neither have ye intred in thither your selfs, but others yt were willing
to have gone in, ye have kept out. For while ye peruersly expound the law, ye
do (as one might say) lay battrey against that which is the principal chief
foundation of all the law. At these manner words of Jesus, (being in deed
half bitter by reason of so plain speaking of ye truth, but yet workers of
hearth, if such as they were spoken to had been willing to receive the
medicine:) were both the Phariseis and also the lawiers sore offended: but
because they knew privily in their own consciences that the things which were
spoken, were even very true, they would make no countenance at it before the
people, but yet in the mean time they lay sure awayt to all the sayings of
Jesus, huntyng and serchyng if any thing might proceed forth of his mouth,
whereupon they might ground or make a foundation of sum surmised matter against
him, to the end they might seem to persecute him, not of a certain private
hatred, but of zele to religion and of a love toward god. For this property
also has pharisaical hypocrisy, that it works ne atte^pteth none so wicked
an act, whereon it lays not a fair gloss of love and duty toward God.

The.xii. Chapter.

ANd because the Lord Jesus knew the malice of the Pharyseis, the Scribes,
and the lawiers to be incurable: it was his pleasure openly to notify and
publishe their hypocrisye, to the end no creature might unawares be deceived
by their cloked counterfaytyng: and so many coumpanyes of people even than
standing round about in so thick press, that they trod one upon an others
heles, he began to say unto his disciples.

Beware ye of the leaue^ of the phariseis which is hypocrisy. Endeavor your
selfs earnestly to be such, as ye would be taken for. Nothing that is cloked
shall from hensfoorth be hable long to be hidden. There shall a time come
which shall vttre and make manifest unto the world as well your innocence,
as also their malice: Neither is there any thing now at this present so close
under couerte, which shall not shortly be uncovered, ne any thing so
secretly hidden, the which shall not cum to the open knowlage of men.
Wherefore beware ye that all your life be void of all cloking or counterfayte
gloss, and that ye neither speak ne do, no nor yet think any thing alone by
youreselfes, which ye would not by your good wills have to be known of al
creatures, for whatsoever ye shall now speak priuelye in the derke, shall one
day in time to cum be reported again in the clear light: and whatsoever ye
shall now say to folks in their ears within your bedchaumbers, shall one
day be openly talked in the house tops. The truth shall offend the wicked
sort being peinted with a counterfeit semblaunce of godlynes: But leat not
the fear of any evil person led you away from the sincere preaching of ye
truth of the gospel. The uttermost extremity of all the mischief that they
can do to you, is but to kylle, yea and the body only can they kille. But
thus much do I say unto you my friends, forasmuch as ye may boldly trust
on my sure defense, leatte not the cruelty of these fellows any thing at all
fear you, who though they attempt all that ever may be dooen, may sleagh the
poor carkesse, and that done, they have nothing besides to do any ferther
harm unto. But he dies not that is slain for my cause. That if your fantasy
be to take fear for to be one of counsel in this case, it is good reason,
that the lesser fear give place to the greatter, and that he rather be had in
fear, who has power with a beck to destroy the whole man altogether. And if
ye will needs have it showed unto you who is he, even God it is, who only
has power when he has killed the body, to cast the soul into hell too.
Leat not the cruelnesse of wieked persons make you any thing afraid, who can
do you no more but light harm, nay can not do you any harm at al, no and
not that neither, but by the sufferaunce of God. That if ye shall upon the
dreding of man, grow clean out of kind from the sincerity of preaching the
gospel: while ye labor to eschew light and transytory mysaduentures, ye
shall fall into harms for ever to endure. Leat therefore one nail drive out
an other nail: and leat the fear of God drive out the fear of men. And
fear ye not lest ye shall peryshe before your day. All men must without
choice ones come to death: neither does it force how long a man has lived,
but how well he has lived. And blissedly does he depart hens, whosoever
dies for my names sake. And yet shall no such thing chance before the time
prefixed unto you by your heavenly father, that ye should not live a whit
the longer, though the fear of death should never so much vex your minds.
Yea and that poyncte also will your father provide for, that every one shall
dye at his due time. Although these things seem in appearance to be dooen by
chance and at all adventures, yet shall there nothing chance unto you, but by
the permission of your father who cares for all things belongyng unto you.
What is of a lower price or a thing more contemned then a selye sparow? May not
a man bye five of them for two ferthinges? And yet does not God leave them
vncared for, and not so much as any one, no not even of the vileste vermin
living, does perish without the knowelage of the heavenly father. But as for
you whom he has specially pyeked and chosen a very few in number out of all
the rest to set forth the glory of his name, he does so greatelye not
leave vncared for, that he has even the veraye heates of your heads numbered
out by tale. The veraye bears of your head are all nu^bred.
Against the will of him it were a wickedness to strive, for nothing will he
desire, but what he shall know to be best. Therefore all your carfulness
concerning your life, cast ye full and whole upon him. He that takes care
for the selye sparowes will not leave you vncared for, being so far better
then all the sparowes in the world.

Wherefore be not ye of the will for fear of any eiuilles or mischiefs
which men may be hable to do unto men, to fall from the profession of my
name, as men remembryng that by these affliccyons lastyng but a short while,
lies the way to everlasting bliss. For he shall not be a partaker of the
joy, who shall refuse to be partaker of the worldely reproach. Albeit this
open shame here among men, Whosoever confesses me before men. etc.
is the true glory before god. For this one thing I say to you of assurance:
whosoever shall profess my name here in presence of men (which to do
shall before the world be a thing odyous and detestable,) I also shall
profess him at what time the majesty of the son of God shall be opened and
showed forth in the face of the Angels of God.

And contrariewise, whosoever shall not acknowleage me here in the face of men,
shall not be known of me before the Angels of God. I know that the
infirmity of this humayne body of mine shall be a slaundre unto many: but a
fault, which either proceeds from a man being deceived by a wrong opinion,
or else cummeth of the weakness of nature, although it be grievous, shall
nevertheless be easilye forgeuen. Therefore that they call me Samaritane, a
drinker of wine, a friend of the publycanes, and Jesus the carpenters son,
shall soon be releassed if they amend. For it is a reproach whereunto the
weakness of this body has opened an entreaunce and occasion. Unto him that
blasphemeth ye holy ghost, it shall not be forgiven.
But whosoever shall speak raylling words against the holy ghost, through
whom God woorketh these miracles: because such an one doothe of a set and
prepenced malice wetingly and willingly resist against the glory of god, he
shall not find any pardone, neither in this present world, nor in the world
to come. Like as to the wicked Angels there is no way leaft to come again
unto repentance, (because they resisted God, not of any infirmity or
weakness, but of an obstinate malice) nor the same wicked Angels shall ever
emende ne have any hope of forgiveness: even in the same state shall men be
sure to be, if they follow the perverse facion of the others. They see me a man, taking rest and sleep, sufferyng houngre, yea and they shall see me
dying, therefore it may be pardoned if they speak any thing of me, that may
truly be said of a mortal man: But that being corrupted with envy, they
impute those acts to the spirit of Beelzebub, which they know to be of the
power of God, forasmuch as on the one side they defraude god of his glory, and
on the other side they put over unto wieked spirits, that comes of god and is
due to him: their so doing verayly is of deiulishe malice, which for the same
cause shall not obtain pardone of god, though being most singularely enclyned
to show mercy, because he can no skille to repent himself of his goodness.
Many ways than shall there be murmouring against your preaching, For some
persons shall persecute you either strayghing out of the right way of mere
simplicity, or else of a maliciousenesse miengled with their error. Othersome
against the conscience of their own heart, shall labor to destruie the
verity which they euidentlye see, and try, and know, and that shall they do
for none other respect, but because it contrarieth their naughty affeccions.
By means of such persons shall the eiuill spirit of Satan rebel against
the good spirit of god, and by help of his guard ye wicked men, he shall
invade you with all kinds of ingiens. And although ye be ignorauntes of the
world, poor men, and of low degree, there is no cause why for you to be
afearde of the vproare and sedicion of the world against you. The spirit of
god being graciouse and plain without any guile or deceit, is sufficient
against all as well fraud as violence of this world. Therefore when ye shall
be haled into their synagogues, app^ached of great crimes, when ye shall be
drawn to come before magistrates or rewlers, Take ye ne thought how or what
ye shall answer.
and princes, do not ye as the common sort of people do, when they are
brought before a judge to their answer, who are much careful what answer
they may make, or what they may speak, to rid their hands of the mattyer.
Thus much shall be given to the puplique authority of a magistrate, that
being called ye shall appear. But cause is there none why ye should be
afearde of the sight of them, or why ye should be careful, how to defend
your selves with an oracion prepared for before: The plain tale of the truth,
shall continually from time to time be ready and fresh in memory unto you.
And such kiende of words to speak, the holy ghost shall sufficientelye
minister unto you as often as need shall require: of such sort as your life
is, such shall your words also be. And nothing there is more pithie or
effectual, then the plain truth without any colors.

And as the fear of judgment makes many go a cross way from the
sincerity of professing the gospel: so does the greedy desires of money
corrupt a great mayny. To the end therefore that the Lord might utterly pluck
that affeccion also out of his disciples hertes, as a thing basse or vile, and
unmeet for such as have entered the charge of heavenly affairs, there was a
matier even there offered unto him whereby the thing might be done. For where
there was a very great multitude of people about Jesus, and yet no man that
had before that day been so bold to ask so low and so basse a mattyer of
him, one said unto him: Master, so it is that a brother of mine usurps my
part of the enherytaunce which should serve us both, and fyndyng many
euasyons and stertyng holes, he delayeth from day to day to make particion
thereof: here leat the authority of thy word be a succoure and aid unto me.
Say unto him, and bid him, to divide the enheritaunce with me. Than Jesus (as
ye would say) taking skorne and indignacion, so to be interrupted from his
heavenly business of preaching, unto carnal and filthy ca^es: and in the
mean while all under one, giving a lesson to his servants that such an one
as bears the office of an Apostle, ought not to be enwrapped in secular and
filthy affairs of the world, answered: Thou fellow, with what face do thou
in the mids of my preaching interrupt me against thy brother in dividing
your enheritaunce? who has made me a judge between you two being at variaunce
about a light tryflyng mattier and shortly to decay? Or who has given me
unto you to be a diuider of enheritaunces? Has not this world judges enough
to end such low matiers of trauerse? I have no such commission, that this or
that party shall grow in richesse by cu^ming to temporal goods or lands by
succession: but that all creatures may come to the enheritaunce of the life
immortal in heaven. And than turning to his disciples and to the rest that
were there present, he begoon even by the exaumple of the party that had
interrupted him before in his sermon, to exhort them from the earneste desire
of geatting worldely richesse: not that richesse are of themselves eiuil, but
because that to put the chief s^aygh of a man's life in the^, and for the
desire of them to be called away from tho things which do earnestly concern
everlasting bliss, Take heed and beware of coue^ousnesse.
is a veary folly. Beware ye (says Jesus) in any wise from all things
belonging unto auaryce. For oftentimes under the color of necessity of making
prouisyon aforehande for ones living, there comes stealing and creping on a
man, a vice never void of pensifenesse and care, which being once suffered to
enter into the mind, leads him out of the right way unto all kind of
dishonestie. Yea and uneath may it possibly be eschewed, except that even those
very things which we do possess of our own good right, be possessed of us
after an vnearnest sort, and with such contempt, that we can set them at
naught when it is expedient so to do. But such people as do in such sort
put their trust and affiaunce in their richesse, that they set a certain
great staygh and assurance of man's felicity in the same, do veraye sore
deceive themselves. No man's life stands in ye abundance of ye things that
he has.
For abou^daunce makes not to felicity, but rather to pensife carfulness:
yea and on the other side to the contempt of the things, which only and
none other are to be sought, and acquired. For the necessity of nature is
appeaced and satisfied with a little. And because he would more diepely
empriente the same in the hertes of the gross people: the Lord added thereto a
parable, by the which every manne might try and examyne his own affeccion.
There was (says he) a certain rich fellow, whose land had brought
exceeding abundance of fruictes and profytes, (as the fruitefulnesse of the
years are not all like, but some years better then some.) The manne having all
the while no mind at all of relieuyng the extreme poverty of the neighbors,
but in sort as though that that had grown, had been brought forth to the
behoof of himself and no more, took care for laying it up in store, and not
for bestowyng any part thereof to the nedye in the way of alines or
liberality. For he said within himself in his heart. What may I best do?
The plenteouse abundance of my corn and other fruictes is over great for
all the barnes I have, to lay up in store the things that have come of this
years grows. If he had taken charity to be of counsel with him when his
heart thus boiled, charity would have said unto him, look well about how
many there be that lack the things which thou haste superfluitee of.
Acknowelage and remember to whom thou art beholding, and whom thou art
bound to thank for this fortunate luckienesse of this year of thine: God has
of a special great tendrenesse toward thee, given thee a stock of goods,
whereof thou may gather great increase and gain of godly weorkes. Make thou
an exchange of Goods tra^sitory, for goods that shall evermore keep at a
staygh: of yearthly goods for heavenly: of humayne goods for dyuyne: so
shall thy lyberalitie be a gain unto thee. But because he had more mind to
take folly and vnbethinking to be of his counsel, Soul* etc take thine
ca^e, eat and drink and be merry.
he did by the instinct and mocion thereof, say within himself: I will down
with mine old barnes, and I will make larger, and in them will I lay up in
store, all the whole increase of this years growyng and the rest of my goods,
that nothing may decay of miscarrie. And when all things are fully
stablyshed, and all thing set in good safety, tha^ taking thought ne care
for nothing I will say to mine own soul. Soul, great abound aunce it is that
thou have of things laid up in store for thee, even enoughe to serve thee for
a great maynye of years: take thine ease, take thy fill of eating and drinking,
and make as merry as thou can. This dream of most fortunate state long to
endure, when the said rich manne did thus cast in his mind, there came
sodaynely unto him the voice of God, saying: Thou foolish man, where thy very
life is uncertain to thee, why dooeste thou hoorde up things in store for
many years to come, seeing thou canste take no fruicion of the things which
thou layest up, any longer, then while thou art in this life, which life no
man is assured of, so much as for one days space. Why dooeste thou promise
thyselfe many and many years? This same veraye night shall they require to
have thy life and soul away. And these things which thou haste provided,
whose shall they than be? Certes they shall be none of thine. Thou must of
force leave them unto an heir of thine own, or to an other if any will enter
to take possession of them. But ghostlye richesse, which by bestowyng thy
richesse in alms thou myghtest have gotten, would have gone with thee when
thou had been dead too: Thou have now heard the exaumple and state of a
man which hoordeth up the richesse of this world to his own use, and is rich
to his own behalf only, and is not rich to wards god: who would fayn be
refreshed and cherished in his members, by such persons as have more then
will serve them, and much more blisfull are they rich, that after such sort
do grow to poverty.

When the lord had thus much said to the multitude of al sorts and degrees,
anon turning to his disciples, whom it was requisite not only to be fer from
alauarice, but also to be void of al carfulness of this life, to thentent
that nothing might hinder or put back their minds from the charge of teaching
the gospel: for this cause (quod he) as I have already before this time said
unto you, even so repetyng the same again and again I shall warn you. Be ye
nothing careful concerning the life of your bodies, as folks in perplexity
and fear lest ye should want meat and drink, no nor yet about the
incommoditie of your body, lest it should want clothes. For your heavenly
father, who has given you that is the better, will also give you that is
less of valor. The soul and life is better then meat, although in the mean
time without meat it endures not in the tabernacle of the body, and the body
is more precious then the garmente: Considre the ravens for they ^^ither sow
nor reap. etc.
do ye think, that your father being no less bountiful then rich will
suffer, that seeing he has of his bounteous liberality given life, there
shall lack meat wherewith the life must be continued? or seeing he has given
the body, he will so do, that the body shall want wherewith to be covered?
where the providence of god does not slack that thing in beasts which are
brute and of no price, will it (trow ye) be slack in you whom he has
specially chosen and deputed to so high a matier? Consider ye the raue^s and
^^owes: they neither sow corn, ne reap, they neither have storehouse ne
bar^^, and yet god does provide also for them concerning their food, as one
that neglects none of the things which he has created. How much more
than will he being your father provide for you, whom he so much more derely
loves above all crows and ravens?

And what, that to be troubleously vexed with the care of such things is a
poyncte not only of mistrustefulnesse toward God, but also of folly? For it
is a plain folly to be vexed with carfulness of mind which shall nothing
avail. No man is hable with all his carfulness to make his life one day
longer then it should be. Which of you. etc. can add to his stature one
cubite*
What that not so much as the quantity or stature of your body, no nor the
shape thereof is in your hand? God gives it such shape as himself best
pleases, he gives it such stature as his will is, and even so dooethe he
give it life too, as long as him lyketh. And who of you (I pray you) is hable
through his carfulness to add one cubite more of heithe unto the stature of
his body: or what man is hable by his careful thought taking, to make one
white hear of his head black, Considre ye l^lies how they grow. etc.
or one black hear white? If than in things which are in mannyer of no
weighte at all, your carfulness can nothing avail: to what purpose is it to
be careful concerning life? Now to the entente ye may not be troubled
with care about clothing of your body, considre me the lilies which grow in
the fields without any man's labor, how they shoot up to their full
heithe and quantity, no man dressyng them, or bestowyng any labor about
them. The lilies do neither labor, ne spynne, ne weaue: and yet the
prouydence of your father does insomuche not suffer them to lack clothyng,
that the most rich king Solomon, when he most of all showed the princely
port of his regal estate, was not at any such time so well arrayed as any
one, which soever it be, of the fyelde lilyes, which shall last but for a
short time. That if god do with so great providence cloth a blade even
commonly growing every where, and anon after to vade and perish away, and
such a blade as this day is freashe and green in the field, and the next
morrow when it is dried up, is cast into the fournace mouth to be burned,
how much more will he not suffer you to be unclothed, o ye of little feyth?
For this carfulness of youres comes of none other thing but only of a
mystrustfulnesse toward your father being as well most mightyfull, as also
most lyberall, yea and also most prouydente. If he feedethe, if he clotheth,
if he gouernethe all things which he has created: than do ye also cast
away all care concerning things of the basseste sor^e, that is to wete,
meat, drink, and clothyng, let neither penurye of such things as these
kylle your hearts, nor more then suffysaunce set you in pride. Neither as
idle folks hang ye all together of the weather, obseruyng and markyng all
lykelyhoodes and fore geassynges of tempests, weaxing pale for woe as often as
the planetes shall threaten penury or derth of Corn. For concerning such
things as these to make great inquisicion and search before a long time to
come, is the condicyon of the Gentiles, who being wholly wedded unto the
world, do not know God. But ye that know how gracious and bountyfull a
father ye have in heaven, why do ye with vain carfulness tormente your
own hearts? For your father knows well enough, that ye have need of such
things as appertain to the necessity of nouryshyng and coueryng the body.
Neither is he so hard, that he will suffer you to peryshe for defaulte of
such things, forasmuch as ye are earnestly occupied about his business.
Seek ye after ye kingdom of god. etc.
But rather leat your chief and pryncipall care be, to set forth the
kingdom of god, whereof I have specially chosen and appoyncted you to be
publishers, and also the mynysters. Especially before al other things, seek ye
the righteousness thereof, not consistyng in Judicial ceremonies, but in those
things which I have aforetaughte you: and with whole heart and mind be ye
earnest in this thing which is of all the most greatest. The other smaller
things, god himself will of his own accord and mocyon give unto you every
one of them, and will not suffer any thing to be wanting.

Leat nothing make you afearde, o little little flock, ye are but afewe, ye are
of mean and low degree, ignorant persons ye are of learning or worldly
knowelage: ye are not with any richesse, with any power, with any weapon, or
with any bendes of harnessed men, armed agynst this world being full of
wiekednesse, and ready to arise against you with all kind of engyens. Yet is
there no cause why ye should be afearde. For it is your fathers pleasure to
give you ye kingdom.
So has it lyked your father, to reiecte men of power, men of learning, and
the proud hearted, and unto you being in worldely acceptacyon, persons most
abiecte, to give his kingdom, which through privy richesse of the soul,
and which by reason of celestial fortresses, is impossible to be subdued.
Wherefore being specially chosen out to so high a dignity of the kingdom
celestyall, contemn ye these basse and vile things: and being marked to
goods that shall evermore continue in their perfeccyon, take ye no regard of
things that shall in short space decay and come to naught. Sell that ye have
and give alms.
That if yearthlye possessions do hinder you or pulle you back from things
being so far better then they, fell ye that ye have in your possession, and
deal the money that is made thereof about for relieuing the need of the poor.
Richesse cannot be laid up in more safe custody, they can not be put to the
bank of exchange with greatter and more assured increase or intereste. Whosoever
gives an alms, lays out his goods to receive intereste at gods hand,
who can not use any deceipte or fraud, and who (as he is both rich and
bountiful) will for vile things repaye most precious, for earthly things,
celestial, for things transitory, and shortly to be taken away, things
eternally for ever and ever to endure. Endeavor your selves therefore to be
grounded rich men in such goods as these: geat you treasour bags, that
do never weaxe old, and lay up treasour for your use in heaven, which
shall never fail, and which shall be safe for you as well from thieves as from
mothes. For this thing we see commonly to chance, that in what place every
manne has his treasoure, there has he his heart also. where your treasour is
there will your heart be also.
For what thing a man does earnestlye love, the same can he not forgeat: like
unto a rich manne that has great goods either laid up at home in his
cofers, or dygged in the ground, though he be abroad from home, yet he has
his heart at home, full of care and fear lest some priuye these should
rob them, lest any other casual chance may either bewray or perish his
treasour. Again they that be in love, have their minds evermore earnestly
fixed and set on the thing that they love. But your heart must evermore be in
heaven. And in heaven will it evermore be, if ye shall have nothing on the
earth, which ye do either hyghly esteem, or love, but shall have all your
treasour safely laid up in heaven.

The time is short: with all earneste endeavor ye must attend, that ye hoorde
up in heaven a great heap of good weorkes. The day approaches even at hand,
in which every one of you shall for the seed that you have sowed of
temporal things, reap an harueste everlasting. But because this day is to
you uncertain, ye must continually from time to time be prepayred and ready
against it come. And that shall ye be, if ye shall not be stopped ne staighed
with any lettes or impedimentes of wordely things, if ye shall not have leat
slip any occasion of doing good. Against the cumming of this day than, Leate
you lo^gnes be girt about.
eat your loignes from time to time be well girt about, leat light burning
candels be in your hands, that ye may be like unto wise and feithful
servants who because they are uncertain what hour their lord will return
from the wedding, they stand continually in a readiness watching with
torche-light, to the end that as soon as he being come home again shall
knock, they may by and by open the doors unto him. This diligence of
seruauantes shall not be displeasaunte to the lord or master, but happy may
they be if the master suddenly cumminge shall see them watching. For this I
say unto you for a certayntie, that the master shall give again to them an
excedyng large reward for that pleasure and service, which nevertheless it
was their bounden duty to do. For he again on his party shall girde
himself, and diligently watching what every one requires to have, he shall as
a seruitoure give it them his own hands. Neither does it make any force in
what part of the night he comes (for it was his pleasure to have that thing
uncertain) but at whatsoever watch of the night he comes, And yt he come in
the second watch. etc.
whether in the secounde or in the third, or in the very dead of the night:
happy shall the servants be, if the lord shall find them in a due
readiness. There is therefore no slackenesse to be used in this life. But so
must men live as though that day should come even at this present hour. For
it shall suddenly and unawares steal upon the world: therefore must men
always provide that it may not come upon them being unready. For after that
he shall be ous already come, it will by that time be ouerlate to amend the
slepinesse before paste. There is none so sluggyshe a master of an house, that
would suffer to have an hole dygged through into his house by a night these,
if he knew before hand what hour the thief would come. That if such an one
does keep continual watch that he may not be spoiled of his worldelye
goods, Be ye therefore ready also, for the son of man will come. etc:
how much more is it your part to watch that ye may not lose the bliss
everlasting? As the night thief comethe stealyng at such an hour when the
folks of the house are most hard and dead in sleep, and least loking of all
is for any body to undermine it: so shall the son of man sodaynely come at
such an hour, when ye shall least of all mystruste or think that he will
come. Therefore in as much as that same time is to you unknown, and yet
undoubted it is that come he will, be ye contynually ready, well armed and
furnyshed with good weorkes, and light, as men clean rydde and void from
all lettes or encoumbraunces of things worldely.

Petur when he had heard these words, said unto the Lord: master, whether
is it thy pleasure that this parable shall appertain properlye, and directely
to us alone that are thy disciples, or else does it indifferentlye concern
and touch all people? Than the lord in such sort attempereth his answer,
that he denies it not in some behalf to perteyne to all men that covet to
atteygne everlasting salvation: but specially he signyfyeth it to concern
such, as have the despensacion and disbursing of gods word committed unto
them. And he added an other parable to that that went before, to the end he
would the better enkiendle his disciples perpetually to be incu^bent upon
their office, and he also propouned and set before them as well a reward when
they had duly executed their office, as also a punishmente to any such as
were slack in his office. Who is a seithful steward, whom his lord shall
make rewler over his household:
A rare thing it is (says he) among men to find an expert and a feithfull
steward to have the dysposicyon of ones goods: who when his master is from
home in a strange country, will see well to his householde, of which he is
made ouerseer and deputye, not to use himself as a Lord or a tyranne over it,
but out of the tresoures of his Lord, to bring forth and pay unto every body
his due allowaunce as much as convenient is, and at such times as is
requisite. Blessed shall that servant be whom his lord suddenly returnyng
home, shall find attendaunt upon his office. For having approved and tried his
upright truth and diligence in the proporcions assigned out unto him, he will
make him rewler of all his goods, and will ^ouchesalue to use him in manyer as
half a partener with himself of all his goods and substance. In the
contrary part, in case the said servant be neither one of honestye to trust
unto, nor yet wise and expert in his office, but taking a pride through the
absence of his lord and by reason of the office of steward or deputy
committed unto him, But if the servant say in his heart: my Lord will differ
his cumming.
shall say in his own mind: my master doothe now set a long day of
cummyng home again, and peradventure he will never come again: in the mean
time I will do all as mine own fancy seruethe me: and thus shall beegynne
to use cruelty over his fellow servants both men and weomen, not only not
feedyng them of his wheat that is their master as well as his, but also
pumbleyng and beatyng them, and vsurpyng a certain tyranny over his other
fellows, he do for his own part all the while eat, and drink, and
bankette, and use to drink himself drunk, wastfully consuming his masters
goods in filthye sensual pleasures and in tyottous excess: what judge ye
that such a steward shall have for his labor? Forsouth his lord shall
return home again at such a day when he was not looked for, and at such an
hour as he was not known of: and the servant dooynge whatsoever himself
lusts without fear or care, his lord shall separate and cut of from his
household, nor shall vouchsalue to suffer him to be one of his house, but shall
rekon him in the noumber of the other vnfeithfull persons, assured to suffer
condygne punyshemente, forasmuch as he would not be myndefull of his office.
The Lord of that servant will come.
An evangelical steward and dispenser of Gods word, can not by any thing
better win his lord and masters heart unto him, then when his lord is
absent, to represent the gracious bounty of him, toward the neighbor, and
not to think himself a lord over the neighbor, but remember that he is a
fellow servant with him.

And certes the more perfeict knowlage that a man has or shall have of the
verity evangelical, so much the more grievous shall his condemnacion be, if
he be negligente or slack to follow that he has learned to be the right way.
For ye Gentiles, to whom the truth has neither by mean of the law, ne by
mean of the gospel been showed, shall be nothing so sore punished, as the
Jews, whom the law of Moses did instruct to some forwardnes in godly
exercise. And among these again the Phariseis, and such as are expert in all
the poynctes of the law, shall be more sharpelye punished, then the simple
ignorauntes. But most grievous punyshemente of all others shall they have,
whom the truth, being well known, whom so many miracles, and whom my lively
exaumple has not moved to the zele and earneste exercise of their duty
toward God. I have hydden nothing from you. Whatsoever thing my heavenly
fathers will has been that ye should know by mean of me, I have opened and
declared it unto you. Beware ye therefore by the exaumple before going of the
negligent servant, that regards not his masters commandment. For such a
servant, as his master has had and used in higher degree above the rest,
as one to whom he has committed the disbursing and bestowing of his goods,
to whom he has opened the priueties of his counsel, whom he has put his
trust in when he went into fer parties from home: except he shall do that
he is commanded to do, and shall prepayre himself to the executyng and
dooyng of such mattyers as he knew that his master would with all his
heart have to be dooen, he shall abye with many a sore strype. But whosoever
shall be of the noumber of the servants, to whom the lord has not opened
the will of his heart, if such an one shall do any offense woorthye
punishmente, he shall drink but with a few stripes. Than is there no cause,
why the despensacion of Gods word and of the gospel being committed to
your charge, should make you any thing the more haulte in taking upon you,
For unto whom soever much is given of him shall be much required. etc.
but rather the more careful to discharge your duty well. He does more
verayly take upon him a charge then an honor, whosoever takes in hand any
office or ministracion in the church. It is a thing of free gratuitee, that is
so committed unto any man, and it is committed unto every man of very
purpose to be brought forth, and used to the common utility of all the whole
household indifferently. And like as masters do require a more straight and
precise accoumpte at the hands of such an one, whom they have put in trust
with more things then an other, so at the hands of such an one to whom a
larger gift or ministracion of knowlage and of authority has been given of
God, there shall more be required, then at the hands of the others: and to
whose credyte a larger and greater ministry has been deputed, the more
persons that he ought to have dooen good unto, so much the more shall there
at his hand be required. The more learning that thou have, with so much the
better will teach thou: the richer that thou art, so much the more gladly
relieve thou the poor: the more that thy power is, so many the more persons
leat thine authority draw and bring unto the gospel. It is an other man's
that thou haste, and not thine own, and the true owners will is, to have
lyberally bestowed upon others that he has lent to thee.

I thirst the salvation of man, and for the cause thereof am I come into the
world, and to the earnest desire of my heart all tarying or delay seems
long. It is no wash doctrine, ne worldely, that I have brought down from
heaven. It is mere and pure fire, which will surely either cleanse and puryfye
a man, or else burn him. And I am even of purpose come, that this same fire
may be kiendled on yearthe. For what other thing else do I desire or want?
Being once kiendled it will far and wide so daynelye take all the universal
world with the slain. But this fire shall not leap ne sparcle forth,
unless this flint stone of my body be first strieken on the cross. That same
baptism is yet behind to come, But I must be baptized with a baptism. etc.
which my father has precisely appoyncted unto me, to be dieped in mine own
blood, to the end I shall through my death suffer pains and torments for the
sins of all the whole world. At that hour and never before, shall that same
sparcle of evangelical charity, appear up and show forth it self among men,
when they shall see an innocent giltlesse man to have willingly suffered a vile
and shameful death for malefactoures, that have transgressed. For this is a
spark of perfeict charity and love. And from this baptism do I not only
not abhor: but for the love that I bear to the salvation of mankind, I am
in a great agonye, to have it accomplished with all expedicion. The nature of
my body abhors the matier: but the entier love of my soul greatelye longs
for it. But this fire being kiendled shall stiere up great vproares in the
world. For it shall be a vehemente fire and an heavenly, as well discussyng
as also strieking forth all natural affeccions of men. For do ye believe
that I am come to bring such peace into the earth, as this world loves,
with whom it is than altogether quietness and tranquillity, wha^ the lusts
and appetites of the heart be all pleased and satisfied, and when the eiuill
persons do agree with the eiuill? No verayly: I am not come to set such
concordes at one, but to send debate and variaunce. People will not every one
obey the gospel, and for the ghospels sake, all other things are to be
contemned. Whereupon it shall so come to pass, that in one house, in which
there was a naughty peace before, there shall arise an wholesome variaunce. For
five sorts of persons being of nature most nere joined together, The father
shall be divided against the ^onne.
shall for my cause be at dyuisyon among themselves, three against two, and
eft two against three. For what is more nere coupled together by nature then
the son to the father? And yet shall the father for the ghospels cause, fall
out and and be at distaunce with the son: and the son shall for the
ghospels sake despise the father. In like mannier shall the mother be at
variaunce with the daughter, but the charytie of the gospel shall be of more
force in the daughters mind, then natural affection toward her parents.
The mother in law also shall be at plain defyaunce and war against her
own daughter in law: but the love of eternal salvation shall with the other
in her mind outweighe the respect of alyaunce of the fleashe. For the bands
of the spirit do much more streygne the heart, then the bands of nature
do.

After these words, Jesus turning to the people, said: Wherefore than do
notye prepaire your hertes to the kingdom of God, which is even very nighe
at hand? Do ye not perceive and feel it to approach, so many tokens of
things as ye have? Why are ye in this behalf nothing good co^iecturers,
seeing that in mattiers of so much less weight and importance, ye have so
quick a smelle to cast and geasse at things to come? For when ye see any
cloud arysing out of the west, When ye see a cloud arise out of the west. etc.
ye streyghte way tell before hand that there is a shower toward, and the
thing comes to pass which ye do so prophecy. And again when ye perceive
the wind to blow from the south, ye tell aforehande that a great heat will
follow, and your geasse does nothing beguile you. Nevertheless litell it
forces, whether it rain or rain not: but it makes very great force, that
through euangelical feith ye procure and atteyne everlasting salvation. O ye
hypocrites after what sort all your doings are cloked and counterfaicte.
And even such as your holiness is, even such like is your wisdom also.
In things perteynyng to this present life ye have a wit and a forecaste:
but in things belongyng to immortality ye have no syghte at all. Ye mark the
part of the sky and of the earth, But how happens it y^ ye can not skill
of this time?
that is next to you, and thereof ye gather conjectures and likelihoodes of
things to ensue. But how happenethe, that of so many tokens as have been
showed unto you, ye do not mark nor epsy the time to be now at hand, which
shall being to all creatures, either health if it be duly accepted, or
eternal damnacyon in case it be neglected? Ye know what the Prophets have
promised: ye hear so many things, which are said and wroughte among you:
ye see the world to be changed to a new state: and can ye not yet of all
these things cast ne conjecture the time to be at hand, that has been
promised? When ye goeste with thine adversary to ye reweler.
This only thing was with all your earnest endeuoures to be attended unto:
neither should any thing be of so great weyghte or regard with you, for
respect or cause whereof ye should sustain any loss or hindreaunce of good
procedyng in the gospel. If thou have good or substance, and the same be a
leatte unto thee, selle it: If any body have dooen thee any offense or
dyspleasure, forgive it rather then to take the vttermoste of thy right at the
law. That if the mattier come so far, that ye be going to the judges, even
as thou goeste thitherwarde on the way, take thou such ways, as thou mayeste
be rydde of thine adversary. It is better to end the variau^ce between you
even with conditions to fare wurse then equity would thou shouldeste do,
then to abide the uncertain end of the judgments of the law, in which
judgments the better cause does not always prevail and geatte the over
hand. Otherwise thou putteste thy self in hasarde and adventure, Thou shalt
not depart thence. etc.
lest the judge shall deliver thee to the gayloure that takes charge of
persons condemned, and he to cast thee in priesone: which thing if it so
chance, this I tell thee for a mattier of certaynetye, thou shalt not get out
from thence, until thou pay that is demanded, even to the vttermoste
ferthing. A busy mattier it is to trauerse the law: and whosoever makes have to
the mark or gole of evangelical perfeccion, has no vacaunt time to be long
let with such coumberouse tariers. First and formoste weigh it well with
thy self, how much more gaynes there is in forgeuing a wrong or displeasure
done unto thee, then in extreme following the suyte of the law for it: in
giving over or leattyng go of a thing, then in recoueryng it by the law.
First thou art sure to gain frendeshippe of the other party, which by
entreyng trauerse of the law is in hasarde of lesing: secoundlye thou winneste
the advantage of a great deal of time, which by following the suit thou must
needs have lost: besides all this thou gayneste tranquillity and perfect
quiet of mind, which quiet the troubleouse suites of the law are wont to
take away from a man: and finally thou doeste escape w^^tsoeuer mishappes or
harms the unlucky end of trauersyng the law may be hable to cause unto thee.

The xiii. Chapter.

While Jesus speaks the premises and many things more to the multitude of
all sorts of people there assembled, partelye prouokyng and luryng them to
their duty toward God with promise of rewards, and partlye making them
afearde with the terroure of punyshementes if they would be negligente in
that behalf, and using all means possible how to enkiendle the minds of the
audience unto the earneste endeavor and excercyse of a better life: there
came, even as hap was, certain persons, which brought him news of a
strange matier and horrible to hear, concerning certain men of Galile, being
haynouse offenders, upon whom Pylate the lieutenaunte of Iewrie, had caused
execucyon to be dooen of a strange exaumple, and the first that ever was of
that sort, which was, that when the parties aforesaid were found guilty
and were condemned for their offense, he miengled their blood with the blood of
beasts which the same Galileans slew in sacrifice after the ordinary facion of
the Jews. And because it was an offense of great enormitie that they had done,
Certain me^ that showed him of the Galileans. etc.
they were punished with an horrible kind of death, to the terror and fear
of all others. Now the vulgar people uses commonly to detest persons so
condemned, and to cry out on them, and to rejoice in their own behalfes, that
they have not committed any such act, when one that makes such reioysyng is
many times eiuill in an higher degree of vngracyousenesse and myschiefe, then
they whose manyfeste and openly known crime has been satisfied and pourged
by open execucion of death. But Jesus being minded that the terroure of this
exaumple should come unto all persons, whereas they that made relacyon
thereof, supposed it not to touch any others saving only such party as
had dooen the same transgressions: made answer unto them this wise. Do ye
believe that these Galileans only and no more, were heinous transgressoures
among all the people of Galile, because the rigourous sharpness of the judge
has showed this vttermoste extremytie of punyshemente upon them alone? It is
not enoughe for you to keep your selves from dooyng the like of their high
offense: but ye must amended from all sins.

Which thing unless ye do, Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
though the merciful favor of God suffer you for the time, or purpose to
have you converted ^^t shall ye all at last peryshe by the sembleable
vengeance of GOD. And because the vengeance being for a time delayed shall
not put you in hope to escape unpunished, except ye amend in season he shall
come sodaynelye and take you ere ye be aware, like as these same eyghteene
persons were of late days sodaynely taken and oppressed with falling of the
toure upon then in Siloe.

Although ye escape the vengeance of men, yet the vengeance of God can by
no means be avoided. The exaumple of those few touches you all. Do ye
believe that when the falling of the said toure oppressed thosesame men,
there were not many in Jerusalem even more ungracious and more mischievous
than they were? But the mercifulness of God differreth them upon hope of
repentance. The crimes of some persons are manyfeste and open, and some
men's are unknown: and every body laugheth on their own eiuill properties:
but among you all there is not one good, neither shall any man escape with his
naughtiness unpunished. Yea and thus much I boldly assure you of, except ye
amend from your former naughtiness, the vengeance of God shall in like
manier light upon you every one. See ye therefore that ye do not abuse the
favorable sufferaunce of God to sin the more at your liberty (as it were)
out of the check, remembering well that the later the vengeance of God dooethe
come, so much the sorer it will light, when it falls. God does many
soundrye ways provoke to repentance: now speaking fair, an other time
putting in fear. At the last when he seethe the obstinate malice of men by no
means to be brought to ame^dement, he vttrely destruieth all the whole man at
once, to the end the party which would not be good to himselfewarde, may be
a profitable exaumple to others.

And because Jesus would the more diepely impriente this sentence in the
hertes of the gross multitude, he added to the premises a similytude apt to
be applied to the case aforegoyng. A certain man (says he) had a figtree
planted within his vineyarde. The party that had set it, came unto it at the
due time, seeking to have the fruicte which now in the beginning by cummyng
forth of the leaves, it seemed lykely to yield, and found thereon nothing at
all saving only leaves. A certain man had a figtre planted in his vineyard.
etc.
Than calling him that had the charge of dressyng and housbandyng the
vineyarde, he said: Behold, the third year is now paste, that I come to
this figtree, seking to have fruicte thereof and yet can I none find,
therefore cut it down. To what purpose does it occupy and coumber a room
in the ground, both hurtyng the vine with the shadow, and also drawyng unto
itself the sap and moisture wherewith more profitable and fruictfull trees
might have been nourished: But the baylife of the vineyarde said unto his
master: Master, thou haste suffered it to stand now three years, leatte it
alone yet this one year more, until I may try even the vttermoste of my cure
to be done upon it. For it may so be, that it is barayne through the
defaulte of the soil. I shall therefore dig round about it, and ca^te doung
about the root. If through such cherishing the tree be revived and stiered
up, and do bring forth fruicte, thou shalt preserve the tree: but in case
thou shalt afterward see it to be of desperate baraynesse, than shalt thou
come to that that is the vttermoste extremity, and shalt cut it down, that
at leastewyse it may do no harm to thy vineyarde. By this present parable
did the lord in general warn and advertise all persons, not to make light
of god provoking them to repentance. But particularely and most directly he
noted and signified, that the nacio^ of the Jews, which having so many times
been provoked and moved to take better ways, as well by the patriarchs, by
Moses, and by the law, as also by the prophets, by John the baptyste, and
lastelye by so many miracles, and by evangelical preaching: yet, because they
did stubbernelye persiste and continue in their obstinate malice, should of
the romans be utterly cut up by the root.

And behold immediately an exaumple of the barrayn figtree, in suchewise as
the very present case might lay plain before the iyes of men the same
thing, which the figure of the parable before going had but (as ye would say)
tricked and drawn out in gross. The obseruacions of the ceremonies of the
law, were (as one might say) the leaves of the Sinagogue, which in outward
appearance seemed to promise most sweet fruicte and unto god most pleasant, of
true godliness, and of charity and love toward the neighbor, where it has
not only brought forth no such like thing, but also has brought furthe
bitter frui^tes of envy, hatted, backebyting, blasphemy, and murder. Now
Jesus when according to his accustomed wont, he was teaching on the Sabbothe
days, there was presen^e there in the Synagogue a certain woman, who had
continually by the space of eighteen years been arrayed with a disease both
incurable and piteouse to se. For she was in her body so shrounken and clonged
together, that she could not lift her head vprighte, ne look upward. There
was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years. etc.
Lo therefore a mattyer and occasyon of showing forth good frui^te, if the
figtree had not been utterly baraine. This weomanne did represente a figure of
the Gentiles, and of such as being openly wicked and full of mischief, did
nothing hyde, but rather show forth their extreme eiuill case, altogether
fixed downewarde upon earthely things, and not so much as once thynkyng on
things eternal and heavenly. Contrariewise the Jew stood bolte vpryghte in
the vineyarde of the Lord, which is the Synagogue, well decked and garnished
with the words of the law and with corporal ceremonies, as it were with
leaves, which Jew could nothing else do, but envy and surmuise false
matiers of accusacion. But the Lord Jesus first of all with these same ^oste
merciful iyes of his, beehelde the womanne. When Iessawe her, he called her
unto him. etc.
And that same very point was even already a lucky token of health b^anby to
follow. And not so contented, he of his own mere mocion called her unto him.
Happy and blessed is he that ever he was borne, whomsoever Jesus calls unto
him, and fortunate that hears him when he calls. The woman comes to him
being full of good hope. The disease was of long continuance, and incurable:
but there is none so great ungodliness or iniquity, that is not through
evangelical faith clearly abolished and put away for ever. Leat us then see
the fruit of the good tree, which Jesus would fain have had, and could not
find in the Sinagogue. Woman (says he) thou art rid from thy great disease
and sickness. He takes no disdain ne skorne to touch her with his holy
body. He lays his hand upon her, and immediately was she able to stand bolt
upright with her body, and knowelagyng the celestial benefit, she glorified
god: So suddenly was the congregation of the Gentiles changed: and forsakyng
all idols, forsaking the earnest desire and gredines of money, forsakyng the
most filthy and abomynable lusts, with which it was a long time in such
wise bound, that it could not have any desire to cum to the knowlage of things
heavenly: it begoon to give laud and praise to the mercifulness of god,
through whose fre benefit and goodness it has clerelye been delivered from
all her sins, unto the which being a long time captive and thrall, she had
in most piteous wise lived as a bondseruaunt unto Satan. Now on the contrary
part consider me the evil fruit of an evil tree. When the reweler of the
Synagogue had seen this matter, (being in deed the said figtree it self
barrain, but yet setting out it self to the iyes of men, as it were to sale,
only by reason of the leaves of the law,) taking indignacion that Jesus had
healed the woman on the Sabbath day, turned himself to the people there
congregated, as though he would have taught them sum great matter. Now hear
then a very right voice of a Pharisee, and by the same voice of this one
manne, esteem thou all the wholle doctrine of that sect. This devout godly man
fearyng lest the people should through the exaumple of Jesus fall unto all
ungodliness, provides to take a good way for their preseruacio^, sayi^g with
great authority: There be six days in ye weke, in which it is leful to work.
Therefore if any body be desirous to be made whole, let him cu^ in one of these
working days: but to violate ye sabbath day, is a thing not standing with gods
pleasure. This so folishe a saying could not ye most merciful lord abide, who
had made ye sabbath day, not for any such purpose, yt men should rest or cease
from helping the neibour, but had made the sabbath to the end there should be
from al evil doings a perpetual resting, which rest yesame outward rest of the
Jews sabbothes did figurate. And because this voice of ye ruler of the
Synagogue was spoken by ye minds of all the Phariseis, the Scribes, and the
lawiers, under the person of him alone, Jesus made answer to them all, saying:
ye hypocrytes, And ought not this daughter of Abraham? etc.
which not passing on the very pith of the law, lie altogether on the rynde or
bark thereof only, and make a glorious painted show of righteousness without
forth, where in deed ye are fer from al true godliness, see ye how wicked Judges
ye are in this matter. Who is it of all you, whom the reverence of the Sabbath
should let, but that he would untie an Ox or an ass of his own from the
stalle to have the same to water? If ye judge the sabbath day not to be
violated for a commodity which is beestowed on a brute beast that does you
service, do ye lay unto my charge, as such a perilous sore act, that I have
on the sabbath day healed this same daughter of Abraham rightly borne, as one,
who in synceritie and pureness of faith does perfitelye resemble her said
parente Abraham that she came of? Is your own private commodity of so great
estimacion among you, that ye have no scrupulositie at all to untie the haulter
unto an Ass on the sabbath day, that he may not perish for default of drink,
and have ye indignacio^ that I have on the sabbath day looced and delivered
this woman here, being one of your own nation, whom Satan has by the space
of eyghtene years kept fast tied and bound? If workyng and labouryng on the
Sabbath day be forbidden, whether of the two does more bodily labor, he
that vntieth an Ass, and ledeth him to the water, or else I, who with a mere
word, and only touching have made whole all this whole woman both body and
soul too? Are ye in such sort more merciful and favorable to an ox or an
ass, then to your sister or brother? And do ye in such wise observe the law,
that for supersticion thereof, ye neglecte that which is the highest and
chyefeste point of all the whole law? These words of Jesus, because they
comprised a verity both clear and manifest, and also agreeable to the common
reason of man's own nature, made these slanderous raillers full evil
ashamed. For it was no small grefe unto them, when any part of their glory
was abated in the face of the multitude, before who^ they had always set out
themselfes as much as they could to their own glory.

Jesus hereupo^, minding to open, that all that same vain glorious bostyng of
the Phariseis which contained an high portly show of holy conversation,
should shortly vanishe away: and contrariwise, that the virtue of the ghospel
should from most low beginninges grow up to so high state of dignity, that it
should draw all the whole universal world unto it, and that ye same should
be by mean of death, and by mean of Apostles being poor mean men and
ignorauntes, put forth two sundry parables at once of one meaning. Ye see
(quod he) that the kingdom of the Synagogue fights against the kingdom of
god. Notwithstanding, the same that is more of puissau^ce and might, shall in
the end have the victory. Therefore the lord as it had been one enspired with a
new spirit, to the intent he would make the multitude of the people give the
better ear unto him, said: to what thing shall I say ye kingdom of god to be
like, or to what thing shall I compare it, to make you understand what manner a
thing it is, What is the kingdom of god like? etc.
by comparison of some thing that is to no creature of you all not excedingly
well known? And when the people every one of them looked to hear sum royal
high symilitude taken of sum comparison of the sun, or of lightenyng, or of
some other such like matter: Jesus thought better to take a parable out of a
little sede yt no body estemeth or sets by. It is like (says he) to a little
grain or corn of mustardsede, which for a time that it is whole, It is like a
grain of mustardsede etc.
like as it is one of the least things possible, so is it a thing of the least
value that can be in the world, and a thing, that neither with the color, ne
with the savor is pleasant to the iye: and if it have any strength or
virtue, it has it withinforth, and not without. A certain wise fellow when he
had gotten one of the said little seeds, he did not set it at naught, ne cast
it away, but sowed it in his garden. And thissame sede of lest value and
regard spronge up, and grew to a mighty great tree, in so much that even
the birds made themselfes nestes in the branches thereof, and for one little
little grain that was sowed, it brought forth many thousands. And ^^ght so the
kingdom of God, when it shall most of all seem to be extincte, and utterly
abolyshed for ever, even than shall it sprede furthe it self abroad in most
largest compace of all. And again, to what thing may I say the kingdom of
God to be like? It is like unto a little lump of leaven, which a wise
housewyfe did hide in three bushels of mele poured together, and there leafte
it (as ye would say) buiried until the strength of the leaven by little and
little turned all the said mele, though there were a great quantity of it: so
in like manier the low and humble doctrine of the gospel shall one day
thoroughly possess all the universal nations of the world.

Jesus after that he had thus much spoken, made haste to the place, where the
grain of the said mustarde seed was to be dygged into the yearthe, and
where the leaven was to be hydden in the meal. For he was on his journey
toward Jerusalem, where he knew that he should be slain. But by the way
as he went through every city, and street or village, he taught all
creatures, because there should no piece of time be lost to the ghospelwarde.
And because he had tofore taught certain high mat^ers concerning that men
should sell all the substance that they had, concerning how men should live
from hand to mouth after the manier of the ravens and the lilies, Then said
one unto him: Lord are there few that be saved?
and concernyg how one ought not to continue in strife and contencion with the
adversary: a certain person comes unto him and said: Master is it true,
that there are but few, which atteigne to salvation? For I judge that there
is not so great a multitude that will enbrace these things which thou
teacheste. And yet on the othersyde, the parable of the grain of mustardsede,
and of the lump of leaven, appears to promise the contrary, that is to wete,
that the effectual power of the kingdom of God shall come to many.

Than Jesus willing to show, that in deed the fame and the knoweleage of the
doctrine evangelical, yea and also the working of miracles should come unto
very many, but yet that no man should come to salvation, which would not lay
clean a way from him all lusts and desires of this world, and be a follower
of poor Christ, said: do all the earnest endeavor and labor that ye can,
to enter by the narowe gate. That thing may not such persons atteygne as iye
slugging full of slothfulness. Men must put their good wills and labor
thereto: the entreyng is narowe, but it leads to the wide way of the kingdom
of heaven. This gate can not receive such as are burdened with richesse, such
as have an heap of honors and promocions upon their backs, such as are full
paunched with excessive delicate fare, such as are heavy laden with couetise,
such as are puffed up and swollen with pride. They that are of such sorts,
do choose the broad and the wide roumed way, and at the first vieu delectable
and flatteryng, but ledyng the straight pathe to death. And therefore make ye
great shifte to enter now while the way thereto lies open: shake of and
cast from you all your packes and fardels, that the narowe entreaunce may be
hable to receive you. For this I plainly say unto you: Many will seek to enter
in. etc
There shall be one day many which shall be desirous and feign to enter, and
shall not be suffered to enter, by reason that the coming thereto shall now be
stopped up. For when the good man of the house shall be gone in, and shall have
shut the door after him, which does now stand wide open for all persons
that will do their true endeavor to go in: than being ouerlate to emende, ye
will acknowleage your error, and having envy at such as are entered, ye shall
begin to stand watchyng at the door, and to knock at the gates, saying:
Lord and Master open the door unto us. Than the good man who could not be
heard before when he desired you to come in, shall again not hear you, but
shall answer in this manier: I hear the name of Master, but I know none of
you for my servants: go ye, and seek him, whom ye have served. Than shall
ye begin to say: Master, how happens, that thou will not now know us?
Thou were borne among us: we have eaten and dro^ken with thee in coumpany: and
in our streets have thou taught many a lesson: and we are thy disciples: yea
and moreover in thy name we have healed sick folks and have cast out devils.
Here at these words shall the good man answer: These things that ye rehearse
do not make unto me disciples of the true right sort. Him that follows
the same steps that I have goen, him will I know for my disciple. Whose men
or from whence ye are, cannot I tell. Hence, away from me, it shall nothing
avail you, to have known the law, to have heard me teach shall nothing
avail you, the cousinage or kynred of birth or nation, Depart from me al ye
that work iniquity.
or the familiarity of conversation in eating and drynkyng with me shall
nothing avail you, miracles showed and done in my name shall nothing avail
you. Whosoever enuieth or hates his brother, whosoever seeks ways for his
own glory with the injury of Gods glory, whosoever prefers money before
the love of his neighbor, such an one of whatsoever nation he is come, is
none of mine. Go your ways hence therefore to receive the reward mete for you
at the hands of him, whom ye have wurshipped and served. My servants,
because they have with me, and for my cause, suffered persecucions and
tribulacions, shall with me enjoy the pleasant sweetness of the feast that
never shall have end. Ye, the which have set more by the pleasures of the
world, There shall be weping etc.
then by eternal felicity, go ye hence to the place where there shall be
weeping and gnashyng of teeth. For the blissful state, when ye shall see it,
of others whom ye had persecuted before here in this world, shall increase your
woeful distress. For ye shall se your progenitors, Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the prophets, whom your forefathers either persecuted, or else
slew, sitting at the glorious feast in the kingdom of God: and your selves
that have been descended of their stock and linnage, to be shut without
doors, neither the prerogative of blood or kynred to have any thing at all
auayled you, your obseruyng of the law to have nothing at all auayled you, the
hearing of us, or the workyng of miracles in times past to have nothing at all
auailed you. Ye should have entered into this bliss through faith. There shall
an other thing moreover be added unto ye premises, And they shall cu^from the
east and from the west
which shall yet more bitterly cause your hertes to burn. You being put of,
who believed your selfs alone and no more to be received in: there shall come
out of every nation of all the whole world, out of all coasts and quarters of
the world, me^gled one with an other, of al ages and degrees without any choice
or accepcion of persons, many which never had any kindred with Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, no knowelage at all of the law, ne any familiarity of conuersacio^
with me, and all these being so dainly through faith made the children of
Abraham, by adopcion, There are last which shall be first.
shall sytte at the feast in the kingdom of God. Thus shall the matter, much
otherwise then ye looked for, be turned to the contrary. They that seemed to be
nerest to salvation, shall be rejected and cast far from salvation: and they
that by your judgment were reputed to be fertheste out of favor from god (as
Idolaters, captains of garriso^s, publicanes, soldiers, harlottes) shall have
the chief and principal honor in the kingdom of God.

Now because Jesus did here and there abroad with great playnnesse and without
sparyng of any body, teach such things as I have a fore rehearsed being
things odious and hateful unto the ears of the Jews: certain Phariseis, of
a purpose to stop the mouth of the gospel by castyng him in a fear, came
to Jesus, and said unto him: Take a wise way for saving and sparyng of thy
life, and forsake Galile. For Herod the king of this province bears the
malice, and seeks an occasion to slay thee. That except thou beware, he will
handle the with no more favor ne mercy then he did handle John the baptiste.
But Jesus declaryng that there could be no daungyer toward him at the
hands of any mortal man, unless himself were contented therewith: and
declaryng that he should not dye, but at such time, as it was decreed by his
heavenly father, neither by any kind of death, nor in any other place tha^ was
appointed and determined, said unto them. Go ye, and thus say unto thatsame
fox, who verily thinks himself by his worldly subtyltie and wiliness, hable
to do feats against the wisdom and workyng of God: Behold it is no works
of man that I do, nor I may not leave of before the time prefixed by god:
Herod has no manner power ne meddling at all in this buisinesse. For like as
his authority or word cannot give unto any man the gift to do the like of
these things which I do: so has not he any power to let any man, to go
thorough with that he has begoonne, till he has ended it. And why should he
let me, if the things be good that I do? I cast devils out of men, I put
away diseases, and all this I do freely, and shall not long do them. The time
is but short, which many people would full fain that it were longer: but so is
it determined by me and my father, that I shall for the health of man continue
doing such like acts, this day and to morrow, and the third day I make a
final accomplishemente and full end of all this kind of my doings. Wherefore
during this so little and short time I must not cease from the office
appointed unto me: but the shorter space of time that I have to work in, with
so much the more earnest endeavor must I do that is by commission deputed
unto me. I therefore must not fle from Herod, but to Jerusalem must I go,
where it is decreed that I must dye, For it cannot be that a Prophet perish
any other where save at Jerusalem. etc
to the end the ungodliness of that city may be made open to all
creatures, where it vaunteth it self in the name and behalf of devout
wurshippyng and seruyng of God. For Jerusalem is thatsame auncyente sleac^ and
murderer of the prophets. Neither is it conueniente that any prophet perish
by such death, in any other place then at Jerusalem. And yet in the mean time
the merciful Lord, who for his goodness was desirous and feign to have all
people saved, because he foresaw an utter destruccio^ and ruin to hang over
the said incurable city of Jerusalem, bewaileth the same, for that by reason of
so often times setting at naught and despising the goodness of god, calling it
to better ways, it had woorthyly deserved to have extreme vengeance of god to
light upon it. Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thatsame ancient murderer of prophets,
and stoner of such men to death as are sent unto thee, how many a time and often
have I assaied to gather thy children together, and to join them unto my
self, none otherwise then the hen gathers in her chickens under her wings,
that they may not miscarry. But thy stubbernes has gone beyond my goodness: and
as though thou had even vowed and beheasted thy self to utter ruin, so
dooest thou refuse all things whereby thou might be recovered and made
whole. Therefore sense thou make no measure ne end of thy wickedness, there
hangs over thee a mercylesse destruction. For your house shall be leaft unto
you deserte and waste, in such sort as there shall scarcely remayn any mark
or token that ever there was any such city as this, Behold, your habytacio^
is left unto you desolate.
which now at this day vaunteth it self to be the head of all holiness and
religion. All your glory shall be transposed from you, and shall go from you
unto the Gentiles. And your own selfs shall give sentence and judgment against
your selfs. And as for me, in deed ye shall put me to death: but this I
plainly affirm unto you, ye shall not see me, before that ye shall say:
Blessed is he, that cummeth in the name of the Lord. This shall be your open
protestacion, which the truth shall enforce you to utter: but yet this
notwithstanding, ye shortly returnyng at once to the natural inclinacion of
your forefathers, shall put him to death, whom ye magnified before with such
high words.

The.xiiii. Chapter.

ANd so it befell afterward, that being desired to dinner by a certain manne
that was one of the chyefe among the Pharyseis, he went to the man's house,
and there took his repaste with him. And it was a sabbath day. And there sat
at the same table also many Phariseis, who according to their accustomed wont,
watched Jesus, if he should speak or do any thing which they might
slanderously reprove in him. And lo even ready for them an occasion of a
false accusacion against him. For there was there in presence a certain manne
possessed with the dropsy, a disease for the most part incurable by any
Physike, talowe colored, and swollen all his body over. But a blessed turn it
was for this pieteous creature, that he came in Jesus sight. For unfortunate is
such a sinner as withdraws or hydeth himself from the sight of him, who
would feign have all people to be saved. And behold there was a certain man
before him which had the dropsy.
Now Jesus knowing well enough what thought the phariseis and lawiers had in
their minds, demanded of them whether it were a thing standing with Gods
pleasure to give health on the sabbath day unto a man being otherwise ready to
perish and dye. When they held their peace and would make none answer, Jesus
calls unto him the party which had the dropsye, and by touching him with
his hands he healed the man, and bid him go his ways. Immediately the
man's color was changed, and the swelling of his flesh abated to the due
course again. And although this deed was wonderful, yet the solemnity of ye
sabbath day being broken (as they interpreted it) did highly offend the
Phariseis. But Jesus showing their religion to be of a perverse contrary sort,
in that they would be offended in the preseruyng of a man's life, and in
saving of an ass were not offended, made answer to their secret thoughts,
and said: If an ox or an Ass of any of youres had fallen down in a diepe
pit on the sabbath day, whether would the party tarry until the sabbath day
were al past, orels making no tariaunce at all would he straight way even
the same day geat out his beast, that it might not miscarry? If the preseruyng
of an ox or an ass does weigh so much with you, that ye think not the
sabbath day to be broken, why is your heart offended, for that I have on ye
sabbath day given health to this man, who was in ieoperdy to have died out of
hand of the disease of the dropsy? In case it be the bodily work and labor
that is weighed, there is more bodily labor in halyng an ox or an ass out
of a great deep pit, the^ in making this man whole of his disease. I have no
more but seen him, touched him, and bidden him go his way. If it be the
person that ye esteem, then ought ye more to tender the preseruyng of one sole
ma^ne, then of a right great noumbre of oxen or asses. And they could not
answer him again to these things.
At all these words the Phariseis played mum. For their hertes were so
corrupt and so perverse, that when they had no answer to make against the
plain and clear truth, yet could they not mollify themselves to allow that
they saw done of Jesus. That in case themselves had been hable to have done
any such like thing, they would with all the trompettes in a countreye have
blown abroad their own glory. But because the lord Jesus would that the glory
of all his doings should redou^d to his father, which was god of heaven: he
euerywhere discovered the peinted holiness of the phariseis, who had ouerlo^g
already mocked and seduced the plain simple people with their cloked
hypocrisy. For they hu^ted for their own glory among men: and therefore they
envied at ye glory of god. And this was a true dropsy of the soul, growing
first of a corrupt judgment of the mind, as the dropsy cu^meth of the liver
being corrupted or perished. For the said phariseis setting al their glory in
such things, wherein there was no gloriyng to be made, were swolle^ with outforth
and puffed up in haultnes and pride, where al their entrails withinforth were
miserably corrupted and putrified.

The Lord therefore, who had with only touching healed the man that had the
dropsy, was very desirous to cure these men's disease also, with the medicine
of wholesome words and doctrine. For whatsoever the Phariseis did, they did it
for pride and for vainglorious bosting. For they would go walkyng up and
down in their philacteries: they would stand praiyng in ye open streets where
soondrie ways mete, and much people pass by: they would have a trompet to
blow before the^ when they gave alms. When they fasted they had a feate to
discolor their faces that they might look pale: they would go hunting about
to have glorious salutacions and gretinges in ye streets: and where they came
to diner or supper, they looked and sought to sit vppermoste at men's tables. So
great was their desire of most foolish vainglorie, and so great was their
swellyng in pride: but withinforth there was nothing sincere and void of
corrupcion. But the party that was diseased with the dropsy, was easily and
soon healed, because he acknowlaged his infirmity, and desired to be made
whole. The disease of ye soul cannot possibly be cured if one will not
acknowelage it. And he put forth also a simylytude to the geastes, when he
marked how they pressed to the higheste roumes. etc
Jesus therefore minded to reprove the hault minds of the other cumpanye of
Pharyseis, whom the same head Pharisey had at that time not for hospitality,
but for a vain bostyng of himself bidden to that diner, for that the same
Phariseis, when they were desired to take any repastes in men's houses, they
looked and made means for to have the vppermoste seat, thinking themselfes
ioly fellows if it happened them to have a place of preeminence at the table,
and contrariwise all sad without any mirth if it had cum to their lo^te to be
placed at the lower end, even much of a sort, as we do now in these our days
see the solemn pompes for the most part to be of our graunde sen^ours, and
master doctors, as often as at any act or commencemente in any university,
they come with great solemnity from the Sinagogue to their feast. Within the
Sinagogue they have their seats made on high, where they sit (as it were)
loking down upon the rest from above, more likely and ready sooner with their
elbowe to iastle and toumble their next fellow down from his place, then to
let any man have their roumes. When they must cum in, a bedle cu^meth before
them, and makes way for them, repeatyng at every other word their honorable
title of Master doctor, Master doctor. They are offended if any man arise
not to do them honor as they pass by, if one do not put of his cap, if any
presume to sit down before the said Master inceptour doctor is come in, and
set in his place. And with these fond ceremonies, is the time consumed away
therewhyle, so that there is no time to learn any thing at al. For the said
Master doctors come not for any such purpose, as either to learn, or to
teach: but to hunt for vain glory among the people by showing themselves in
their degree. And with a great pomp come they first in, but with a greater
pomp do they go forth again. One that knew it not, would say, that it were
some solemn stage plays in playing, or else the corpse of some great rich
cobbe, that were going to buirying. And here eftsoon is no small a do for
places in what order and how to go. Not one of them, but he thinks himself to
have had a great injury done unto him, if he go on the left hand of an other
that seems to be his iuniour or inferior. Again at the sitting down to the
feast, meruaylous striuyng there is for placyng of every manne in his degree
and order. What needs many words? It is the disease of the dropsy all that
ever they do, and an huntyng for vaynglory it is, whereas all the while they
would among the people be reputed and used as God almighties fellows. Jesus
therefore couetyng to minister a lesson of good doctrine to them that were sick
of such a disease, (that is to were, how that it is not true glory which is
sued and sought for, but which thou eschewest as much as thou may, even
when thou most deseruest to have it:) propouned a parable as here follows, in
such wife after a civil and courteous sort touching the conscience of every
one, that nevertheless he uttered ne bewrayed none of them by name. When thou
shall be desired (says he) or bidden to a weddyng feast, beware yt thou do
not in thine own person prevent and take the chief place to begin the table:
lest percase after thou be set, there come in suddenly some other manne of
higher degree and better reputacion than thou art: And thou than with shame
begin to take the loweste room. But rather when thou art bidden, go and sy^
in the lowest room.
and now the party which desired both thee and him to the feast, come and
bid thee to arise and to let a better man have thy room. And than for the
glory which thou soughtest to have, thou shall win shame, and shall be
constreyned with read chekes to be content with the lowest place of all.
Therefore rather, when thou shall be desired to any wurshypfull table, choose
and take unto thy self, the neythermoste place of all to sit in, that when the
maker of the feast shall come, he may say unto thee: Friend go up to a place
of more honor: Than shall thy humility turn to thy glory and wurship among
the rest of the geastes. Thy humility shall they perceive well enough by that
that thou chosest out the lowest room of all to place thy self in: and thy
dignity shall they know by the maker of the feast. Even likewise it is in the
life of man. The greater man of dignity that one is, somuche the more must he
humble himself, until he come, who does with true and perpetual glory
exalte such as are of low degree to the worldewarde, For whosoever exalts
himself etc.
and the proud and high he casts down. And so likewise in the kingdom of
God, the inferior people has been received even unto the high degree of
Apostolical dignity: and the priests, the Pharisees, the Scribes, and the
lawiers have been rejected. The Gentiles acknowleagyng their baseness, have
been lyfted up to the brotherhood of eternal glory: and the Jews, who would
alone have reigned at the feast, now either have no place at all, or else have
the last place.

lest they also bid thee again, and a recompense to be made thee. But when
thou make a feast, call the poor, the feeble, the lame, and the blind, and
thou shall be happy, for they cannot recompense thee. But thou shall be
recompensed at the resurreccion of the just men. And this parable forsouth
aforegoyng, concerned the proud Pharisees. The Lord added thereto another
parable, which directely concerned the principal head man of the Phariseis,
which was the maker of this dinner. For the rich cobbes, while they would seem
to be men of good hospitality, they call not to dinner and supper whom they
may refreshe: but such persons, of whom they may be bidden to as good a
feast again, or where hence they may seek for glory to themselves ward. And
in deed such making of feasts is not hospitality, but ambicion, or avarice,
or else both together in one. For that is to be called liberality, which with
ready will does a benefit to any man without any respect, and without hope of
any thank or recompense to return to himself again thereby. The tenor of
the parable was this here following. If thou be disposed well to bestow a feast
or repaste of thy making, When thou make a dinner or supper call not thy
fre^des. etc.
or if thou at any time have a mind to give a dinner or a supper, call thou not
thy friends, which have no need of thy liberality, or such as have done thee
some great good turn before, lest thou may seem either to make a recompense
for a benefit received, or else to seek to have some benefit by them whom
thou do call, or else to call them for very shame that thou may not seem
unthankful: neither call thou thy brethren, that is to say, men of thine
own blood and kindred, or else thy neighbors which dwell about thee, lest thy
benefit may seem to be a thing dooen for the only respect of kynred, and not
for any good heart and zele to do a good deed: ne call thou not thy rich and
welthie neighbors, lest the thank of the feast that thou have made, may
perish and be vttrely lost. For truly it will perish and be lost in deed,
if they bid thee again, and a diner either as good as thine was, or else a
fyner and deintier be given thee again. For thy benefit being so recompensed
or paid for, they shall ough thee no thank at all. But in case thou be minded
well to bestow a diner or supper, But when thou make a feast, call the
poor. and
whereby there may come back again to thee, a veraye large reward not from
men, but from God: call thou the poor, the weak, and the feeble, the blind,
and the lame. In refreshyng of these, do thou refreshe God. Thou will
peradventure say: In such ones shall both my labor and my cost be lost. For
they have nothing to recompense me again, and they be always in need of
another, when one is paste. Even in this very point shalt thou be blissed,
But thou shall be recompensed at the resurreccion.
that they have nothing to give thee again. But they have an incomparable
rich patron, who will suffer all to be imputed as done to himself,
whatsoever shall be bestowed on them. He will for these transitory things
repaie everlasting. Do thou not over hastily ask recompense. It is one of
perfect true dealyng to whom thou lendest it. He will undoubtedly make
recompense, if not in this life, (albeit he will here also recompense it) yet
at leastewyse at the resurreccion of the just. And truly this parable of the
Lord did concern not only refreashing of the poor with food of meat and
drink, but also relieuyng of all manier necessity of the neighbor, whether
he be to be taught, or to be told of his fault, or to be coumforted, or by
whatsoever other ientyll point of charity to be ferthered toward his
health of body or of soul. And al these things are to be reputed as dooen
to god, and not to the man.

When Jesus had spoken the premises as well concerning the wedding feast, as
also concerning the resurreccion of the just, one of the geastes at the table
being as it were half in a dream, touched with the desire of the celestial
feast which Jesus had made mention of, said: blessed is that man which shall
have the hap to eat bread in the kingdom of god, which he spoke (as ye
would say) giving half a watch word, that few there should be to whose
lotte that same felicity should cum, and as though not every body without
excepcion should be received to the feast, but the Jews only, or the head me^
of the Jews. But Jesus by mean of a parable which he propouned unto them,
taught them that in deed the Jews were called in the first place, to the end
they might not complain or find fault that they were naught set by: but for
as much as they being wedded to the affairs of the world, refused to cum
when they were called, as men that set more by goods which should
afterward perish, then by the life everlasting: all nations indifferently
should be called, to the end that the noumbre of Christ's church and
congregation might be made complete: the parable was this here following. A
certain out rich manne had appointed to make a sumptuous great supper. A
certaylie man ordained a great supper. etc.
And to this supper had he bidden a right great coumpanye. And when the time
of supper was even at the very point of the hour, he sent a servant of
his to give knowelage unto all the bidden geastes, that the supper time was
now very nere to ward, and that they should therefore cum with speed. He had
bydden theyin long before by the Prophets, he eftsoon gives them word
thereof by John, and by the soonne of man, cum your ways (says he) for
now are all things in a readiness. In this case whereas they might at their
pleasure have had full fruicion of the supper long time looked for, they
begin every one to make their excuses together, one by one color, and an
other by an other. For the first of them being a man whollye bente to
encreacyng of his substance, and setting more by the gaining of worldly
possessions, then of everlasting bliss, made this answer to the servant
being earneste with him to have him cum away. I have boughte a piece of land
in the field here, and I must remediless go thither, to see that I have
boughte: I pray thee let thy master hold me excused. Then went he to the
second. And he being sick of a like disease, answered: I have bought five
yoke of oxen. I must therefore needs go to prove them, whether I have made a
good mercate in biynge of them, An other said: I have bought five yoke of oxen
etc.
or not. I pray thee cause thy master to have me excused. For I would with
all my very heart come if I might. Than went he unto the third. And he also
made an excuse, saying: I have married a wife, and thou know what a buisie
matter that is, how many cares it brings with it at his tail: therefore
though I were never so well willing, yet I may not now come. Thus when they had
every one of them made their excuses one by one color, and an other by an
other: to the end they might be wurse pynched at the heart root in time
coming when they should have perfect intelligence as well how great a thing
they had despised, as also what manner persons had now succeeded them unto
the fellowship of the blisseful state so refused, he said unto his servant
that was the bidder of the geastes: go thy ways quickly into all the streets
and laues of this city, and whatsoever persons thou shall mete, impotent,
blind, and lame, bring them to my feast. I called the others first in the way
of their honesty and preferrement, they have no cause to find any fault. Go
quickly into the streets. etc.
Though they loathe my feast, yet shall it not therefore be lost. There be that
shall have the full pleasure thereof, though they set not by ye honor that is
offered them. I shall make that they which think themselfes great states,
shall have envy and despite in their very hertes to see themselfes far wurse
then the blind, the impotente, the lame, and others the most abiectes of all
creatures. The servant came again: and all things accomplished which the
good manne of the house had given him in commandment, he said unto him:
Master, I have brought all that I could geat at adventure whatsoever they
were, even out of the mids of the streets and the ways, and yet shall some
piece of thy feast be vacaunte, and shall lack geastes. For thou have
purueied and dressed an excedyng plentiful feast, and place, to receive an
innumerable coumpany of geastes. Upon this the Lord being very desirous, that
the feast which was prepared should serve to the commodity of very many,
says unto the servant: Go thy ways once again, go thou, even without the
precinct of the city too, into the ways and hedges and gather folks together
from whence soever thou can geat them, Go out unto the high ways and hedges,
and compel the^ to cum in.
beggars and straungiers, be they never so unacquainted. Whom, if they be
loathe to come, compel them even by importunity, to come unto me, that my
house may at last be furnished even full.

And this I affirm unto you, that not one of all those men, who had so much
honor showed them, as to be first called, and now have dysdayned and lothed
my feast, not one of them shall taste a bitte of this supper of mine. It will
one day peradventure repent them, when they shall see the delicates, with the
goodly furniture and service of the feast, For I say unto you. etc
and they shall have envy at such persons, to whom their skornefull lothing
of it, has made room to sit in their stedes. But they shall than in vain
desire to enter, forasmuch as when they might have so done, they made their
excuses, and would not cum.

it: lest after he has laid the foundation, and is not hable to perform
it, all that behold it begin to mock him, saying: this man began to build,
and was not hable to make and end. Or what king going to make battayl against
an other king, sits not down first, and calls in his mind: whether he be
hable with ten thousand, to mete him that comes against him with twenty
thousand? Or else while the other is yet a great way of, he sends
ambassadoures and desires peace. So likewise whosoever he be of you that
forsakes not all that he has, he cannot be my disciple. After that Jesus had
heard al these words at the feast of the Pharisees, he went forth still on
his way toward Jerusalem. And there followed him in coumpanie, a mighty
great multitude of people. There followed him with their feet a great maynie
which had not been hable to follow him in the exaumple of his life. For he
went toward his cross, whereunto he must be ready whosoever is willing to
be a disciple of his: Turnyng himself therefore to them that followed him, he
said: Not every one that follows me with the feet of his body, is my
disciple in veraye deed. Let none join himself to me as my disciple, except
he be ready to suffer the like, that I do now make haste unto: he must
vttrely renounce all worldly affeccion, whosoever is disposed to be a
perpetual disciple of mine. For if any person come unto me for such a
purpose, and does not yet hate his father, his mother, his wife, his
children, his brethren, and his sisters, yea and moreover his very life too,
he cannot be a disciple of mine. And he that is loathe or unwilling to bear
his own cross, and so to follow me, cannot be my disciple. Or any manier way
else, if one come to me being entangled with the worldly affeccions of richesse,
of promocions, of sensual pleasures, of parents, of kynsfolkes, of alyaunce,
or clogged with desire to live still in this world, with fear of death:
whansoeuer any occasion is laid before him, he will be ready to sterte back
from his purpose and profession that he has taken upon him. Therefore before
thou enter the matier, prepare thou a mind nothing nyce, ne coye, ne delicate,
to endure to the vttermoste all things of hardness and of adversity.
Otherwise it is more pardonable not to have entered a matier, then afterward to
fall from the thing that thou have begoonne.

There is at leastwise in this case so much providence and circumspeccion to
be performed and made good, Which of you disposed to build a toure?
as men commonly show and perform in affairs much more lighter then this.
For who is there among you all of so little forecast and circumspeccion, that
being purposed in his mind to build a toure, he will even at the first chop
and unadvisedly without any consyderacion set upon the doing of that he has in
his head? For he does not only think this in his mind, I will have a
toure: but before he cast any foundation, he will with good laysure at a
vacaunt time sit down, and cast his penywoorthes in his mind, what charges
will be requisite for the finishyng of such a toure. That if he shall find
his substance to be so little, yt he cannot be hable to bear the necessary
charges thereof, he holds his hands, and lets it alone, lest that if the
foundation being once laid, he should afterward leave of, in consideracion
that he is not of ability to perform it: all folks which passing by the
way should see the work begoonne, and leafte of in the mids ere it were all
finished, would begin to mock him saying: This fellow here has begoonne to
make buildings, which he has not been hable to bring to a perfeccion.
Therefore if shame be a thing of so great weight among men, that none dares
be so bold as to begin a building, but he will ask counsel of his
substance and ability aforehande: how much more is it expedient to weigh
the strength of your heart before ye profess that ye will be my folowers? from
whom if ye shall once begin to step back again, it should be a foul
shame unto you before the Angels of God. It is no matier of nice delicateness
to follow me. Neither is it enough to set a face or a braggue on the matier
with high words, onles your strength be sufficient and hable for the same. And
what king has so little remembrance or consideracion with himself, that in
case he entende to furnishe a voyage of warfare against an other king, will
not ere he make any stieryng toward war, sit down leasurely, and first
weigh and ponder diligently in his mind the puissaunce of his royalme, whether
it be expedient to go with a power of ten thousand men, and mete his enemy
cumming against him with twentye thousand men? That in case he perfectly
know his power to be ouerweake to bicker with him, he will, before that the
other bring his army any thing nere, send ambassadors to treacte upon
articles of peace. For truly so to do is better to be suffered, then to try
the hasarde of battle with powers and strengthes vnegually matched. For it is
more honesty for such an one, So likewise whoso^uer he be of you that
forsakethe not all. etc.
before battle be joined, to make treactie of atonement, then after the
receiving of a great plague to be glad to take peace, yea and the same upon
conditions more to his dishonor. That if men can skyll in such affairs to
make their accoumpte what they are hable to do before they begin: how much
more mete is it the same to do in this buisinesse, then which there is none
other more greater or more requiryng a stout courage? Whosoever therefore of
you all there be that follows me, and has not with the very affeccio^ of
the heart renounced al things that he has in his possession, he may not be a
disciple of mine. He must be a ientilmanly disciple of the right making, orels
none at all. For there is nothing more abiecte or vile then such an one as
being ouercummed with the desires and lusts of the fleashe, has stepped
back and gone a way from the profession of evangelical perfeccion once taken
in hand.

And a disciple of mine ought to be like unto salt. Salt if it have quick
strength, is of good effect for preseruyng and seasonyng of all meats. That
if it cease any longer to be salt, (that same native strength vanished away,
in sort that the salt self have need of other salt to make it sauery:) than
can it by no means be brought to any such pass, It is neyth^r good for ^
land nor yet for the dounghill.
that it will be good to serve for any use or occupacion. For neither can it
serve to poudre or season any thing, ne yet be seasoned and made sauoury of
other salt. Other things although they be corrupted, yet they serve for some
occupacion or other. As (for exau^ple) wine, after it has lost the verdure,
is turned into vyneager. But salt being a thing made in deed to a great
effect, (albeit to no more effects but the same one only, that is to we^e, for
seasonyng of meats,) if it be once weaxed unsavory, than is it mete for no
bodies use, insomuche that it is not good to be cast on the dounghill neither,
on which are all such other things cast, which are most full of
corrupcion. For if it should so be mingled with the rank dounge, it would
cause baraynesse: and so far is it from seruyng to any use, that it also
hurts whatsoever it touches. By these words did the Lord Jesus give half
a rebuke to the unadvised rashenesse of some, who would needs appear to be
disciples of Christ, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
when he right well knew, that even these, whom he had specially p^eked out
and chosen but a very few out of all the whole number, would afterward
shrynke away and fall from him, at the terrible sight of the cross. But to
the end these sayings might be dieply enpriented in their hertes, to be
better understood afterward, he said moreover: let such an one hear
these my sayings, as has ears apt to receive such things. For not the
ears of every body can abide such manier talk.

The.xv. Chapter.

When the whole multitude of the people drew nere unto Christ, and came
thick about him on every side, and he neither put any one from him, nor
despised or set at naught any of them: certain of the Publicanes and
certain notable sinners were so boldened with it, that they feared not to
approach nere unto him, which kind of people the Pharisees did much abhor
and accoumpte abominable, because they would have it to appear that
theimselues were holy men in deed, whereas the most undoubted token of
holiness is, not to contemn ne disdeyne a sinner, but by all manier means to
labor that the^ame may amend, and to rejoice when he does amend.

Therefore whereas the Pharisees were withinfurth full of disdeyne, envy,
hatred, couetife, and pride, yet in their own sight and judgment they seemed
righteouse: when they saw Jesus willyngly to suffer the Publicanes to approach
his presence, as often as they would, and not the Publicanes only, but others
also which lived in slaundre and obloquie, for their transgressio^s
notoriouslye known to the world, (as for exaumple) bawdes, and harlottes,
with such others: they murmured against his merciful dealyng, and said: This
manne which does profess a certain new and uncouth trade of holiness,
yet does nothing eschew the coumpanye of naughty persons, but receives
even known sinners to talk with him, and does in so much not flee ne
abhor to have them come and be with him in coumpanye, that he even eats
also with them, nothing remembryng how that the good men are defoiled by the
coumpany and conversation of the eiuill among them. What man among you having
an hundred s^ep^*
Than Jesus to the entente he would vttrely wede out of his disciples hertes
this merciles disdeyne, put forth three parables of soondrie tenours, but
yet cumming all to one point and conclusion in the effect of their exhortacion:
that is to wete, to all possible mercifulnes toward a sinner refourmyng his
naughtye life. For such an one is not only not to be cast of and rejected
when he returns again to better grace, but also by all manier ways to be
exhorted that he will amend. The first parable renneth thus: How greatly God
tendreth a sinner (says Jesus) and turns not away his face from the same
sinner turnyng again to grace, and amending: every man may conjecture by his
own heart and affeccion. Is there any man of you, which has an hundred sheep
of his own (for in deed every man derely loves any thing that is his own,
nor would not have any part thereof perish or miscarrye.) And what would he
do, if it should chance that one of the hundred should break of and straygh
from the flock? would he not with the loss of thatsame one be so greatly
moved, that the nyntie nine residue leafte in the wielde field, he would
carefully go rennyng about to the other that were lost, and would not be in
quiet until he had found him? And what if he chance to find again the
little selye sheep which to fore was lost? Forsooth as a man much reioycyng,
he will lay him on his shoulder and put him among the residue of the flock,
a gladder man of that one sheep received again which he feared had been
lost, then of the safety of all the rest of his flock, for which he had
taken no fear of miscarying. And so great is his gladness, that it cannot
staigh ne refreyne it self, but it must break out in the presence of others.
For so soon as he comes home, even as one that had gotten some notable great
gains, he calls his friends and neighbors together, saying unto them:
Declare and show your selves glad on my behalf, rejoice ye like true friends
at my joy: (for among friends it becummeth that all things be in common)
because that I have found my sheep which I had lost. If this be the
affeccion of a good shepeherde toward his flock, of what affeccion do ye
think God to be toward mankind whom he created, who^ he nourishes, whom he
has for the glory of his own name predestinate to everlasting bliss? will
he (trow ye) despise the sinner whom Satan has seduced and led a contrary
way from the flock* or else (as he is al merciful and tender loving over all
things which himself has made) will he not rather do all that may be
done to recover and win such an one into his own hands and possession
again, and with great joy receive the sinner again, when he repents, for
whom he took great grief and thought that he was lost? I sa^e unto you, y^
likewise joy shall be in heaven.
Be ye on my word right well assured, that as the said shepeherde for the
receyuyng of the same one little se^^e sheep makes much reioycyng with his
friends and neighbors: even so there shall be greater joy to all the angels
in heaven for one sinner repenting and amendyng his naughty life, then of
nynetie and nine just men the which have no ^ede of repentance. This image
or parable did in deed most directly and properly signify and represent the
Lord Jesus, who only is that same shepeherde of goodness incomparable, who
when mankind had fallen and trespaced, did reconcile the same again to his
father, paying of his own body that which we had deserved, and carrying in
his own body all our transgressions. And albeit he found never a nation that
was not much burdened and endaungered with sin, yet the Jews, if they were
compared to the other heathen nations, seemed to have a lykelyhood and a show
of righteousness for that they wurshipped one God alone, and for that they
observed and kept a law given by god. And some there were among the Jews, who,
because they did after a more streighter sort cleue to the outward precepts
of the law, thought themselves in their own opinions to need no repentance.
But the righteousness of these brought less joy unto the tender loving
shepeheard, then did the heathen nations turnyng from great and manifest
sins, as from idolatries, from adultries, from strange and unnatural
misusages of the body. And among the Jews Paul did more set forth the
mercy of god in that he changed from a persecutour, and became an Apostle,
then if he had secretly miengled Christ with ye laws and supersticious
customs of the Iewishe profession, which thing was at that time done of no
small noumbre. As for the parable does generally concern the apostles and
their successors the bishops. For these ought to bear the affeccions of
Christ their guide and captain toward his flock, at leastwyse if they be
not hyrelynges but true shepeheardes. For oftentimes it comes in ure, that
such as be once reclaymed and thoroughly converted from manifest sins of
great enormitie unto true godliness, do in the ensuyng of godly
conversation, outrenne and pass those, which never fell into the like heinous
enormities. Such persons will not the euangelical shepeheard despise or
disdeyne, but rather seek always possible until he shall eftso^s have brought
them home again, and restored them to the shepecotes of the church. The
repentaunt sinner endeuouryng to walk a new life, he will take to him again
with great gladness, and with a common reioycyng of all the feythfull
congregation. Leat the Pharisees murmour and clatter against him, which
trustyng to their deceiptfull and false righteousness, do not perceive nor
understand how much more acceptable mercy is unto the lord, then any kind
of sacrifice dooen unto him. Such as are righteous in very deed, such as are
unfeigned friends and favorers of that good shepeheard, will show themselves
more gladder for the receiuyng again and the recoueryng of one lost sheep, then
for many such as do put their trust and confidence in their own cold and
naked righteousness. For they do not any ferther charge or burden him with
his old faults and misdooynges, which God of his mercy has freely remitted
and forgotten: but with much reioycyng they show forth their gladness which
they conceive for the returnyng of a sinner unto a new life. He could not have
returned, except the shepeheard laying him on his shoulders, had brought him
home again: and therefore the whole compainye of saynctes renders thanks and
rejoices at the goodness of God, not envying the same benefit unto another,
of the which benefit every one of them have had experience and proof in
themselves before: estemyng and reputyng it common to them all, whatsoever has
chanced to every particular membre, whether it were good or eiuill. And good
reason it is, that the reioycyng and gladness of ye church should be common
to them al, seeing yt the grief and sorrow was common to them all. And this
was the first parable whereby our lord checketh and reproves the proud and
arrogant righteousness of the Pharisees, which did nothing but only hate
sinners, and eschew their coumpainie: whereas it is the duty of true
holiness to procure and study for the health and emendemente of all
creatures, and such as are guilty and faulty toward God, to call home again
by ientilnesse to better ways: and with all possible affeccion of love and
charity, tendrely to receive such as repent and emende their lives. If
Christ, who never knew sin did use this mercifulness toward sinners: how
much more does it beseme a man being his own self subject to vice and sin,
to show and use the same mercy toward his neighbor?

Either what woman having re^ne grotes, if she lose one?
The secound parable renneth thus. What woman (says Christ) is there among
you, which if she had ten grotes, and should lose one of them, would
neglecte the loss of one grote, because she had the other nine safe enough and
sure in her custody? What than will she do? truly she will light a candle,
turn and toss up the rushes, search every corner of the house, she will remove
al thing out of his place, and short tale to make, she will never make an end
of sekyng until such time as she has found her grote that was lost? That if
it chance her to find it, than is there so much reioycyng made of the woman
for that one grote received again, that she can not tempre or staygh her self,
but even among her friends and gossops she must declare and tell it out. And
her said gossops being called together, she will say unto them in this wise:
Rejoice ye, and show your selves glad for my cause, that I have found again my
grote which I had lost. She makes no boste at all of the other nine which
were not lost: she glories of that one grote and no mo, which she has found
and got agyne, and thinks herself a richer woman with that same one grote,
then with the other nine. If a woman be so affeccionately set toward her money
that she is much grieved with the loss of any part thereof, and greatly
rejoices for the fyndyng of the same again, be it never so little a portion: how
much more will God be of the mind, that no part should be lost of men,
for the redemyng and saving of whom he has willyngly given himself to be
hanged on the cross, because he fourmed and made manne after the pattern of
his own lyknesse?

Than added he ferthermore the third parable, which albeeit it generally
apperteineth to all sinners, arysyng from their sins and trespaces, yet for
the rate of the time in which it was spoken, it does more directly touch
the Gentiles called and received to the grace of the gospel, and the Jews
(who seemed to themselves already just) envying the felicity of the same
Gentiles. The discourse and process of the parable is this that follows. A
certain man (says Christ) had two soonnes, of which the younger following
the instinct and leding of youth and folly, went unto his father and faied unto
him: father give me my childs part of your goods, Give me the portion of the
goods. etc.
and I will after mine own fashion assay what profit and gains I can levy
thereof. The father being te^dre over him, and lettyng him follow his own bridle
and course, divided his substance between his two sons, and either of them
had his own portion delivered him, and free liberty withal, to put it to
such use as he would himself, but yet not without hope that they would thrive
and do good therewith. The elder planted himself not far from his fathers
house: but the younger within few days sold al his substance that he had,
and when he had turned it into ready money, he strayed from his fathers, and
went into a far country. What should he do being a young man, being at
his own liberty and master of himself, and living far from his father, in
a strange country? He utterly diuorceth and disseuereth himself from god his
most ientell father, who makes himself a straungier and a pilgrim of this
world. This disseueryng and sundering is not of place, but of affeccion and
heart. Evil talk^ does corrupt and mar good manners. The Jews had received
a law by the instruccion and guydyng whereof, they did know what was to be
followed, and what to be eschewed: and the Gentiles also had their gifts, as
quickness of wit, the knowlage and understanding of the things created, and
made of gods handy work, by the which they might have known the maker
(as in very deed a knowlage of him they had.) Yea and they wrote and setforth
books very absolute and perfect, of the manier and form how to line well: but
not having in their mind that they ought to refer and attribute these very
^ame richesse unto God as the autour of them, which he did tenderly give, not
to any such end or purpose, that they should folishely abuse them, but that
with the same they should wurship and honor their most beneficial father, and
by this wurshippyng, provoke him to ferther lyberalitie to give them more. But
how far had they strayed and gone wanderyng away from god, in that they did
wurship wood, stones, dogs, oxe^, apes, serpe^tes, oynions and lekes, as if
these things had been Gods? And how far were they gone from god in that
they fell into such filthiness, as the very perceiving and reason of nature
has evermore removed and kept the brute and saluage beasts from? Unhappy is
that liberty, which the fathers presence does not govern and stay. For
what chance at length befell ye young man now set at his own free liberty
out of his fathers tuicion? he spe^te and wastefully consumed among straungiers
all the substance, not of his own, (for nothing it was that he had of his
own) but of his fathers. And he spent it out riottously at dyce, on harlottes,
and in feastyng and banquettyng. For plaineriotte it is, And there he wasted
his goods. etc.
whatsoever is spent about the inordinate lusts of ye body without necessity.
Verily the said inordinate lusts and desires do corrupt and mar even the
right precious gifts of nature. And wha^ he had wasted all his substance,
following in all behalfes his own sensual mind and pleasure: there arose a
great famine in the said country where the young man kept himself as a
strau^gier and pylgrime. For this world has nothing in it that may fully
satisfy the soul of man, but only that which is the chiefest and most best
thing of all, which thing is no where else but only in the fathers house. Well
what should the young man do being a straungier among such as he knew not,
being naked without clothyng, and being in the daungyer of death through great
houngre? whereas before it was grievous unto him to obey the commandment of
his most ientle father, he was now of force constreyned to be as a bond
servant to a foreyne and discourteous citezen of a strange town. And came to a
citezen of thatsame country.
When men refuse to receive the sweet yoke of the Lord, than are they
compelled to bear the most hard and heavy yoke of Satan. Will thou hear how
miserable a kind of bondage it is to serve the desires of the world? The
citezen that was his master sent him to his mainour in ye country, there to
keep and feed his hogs. From how great dignity into how great
reprochefulnesse was the miserable young man brought through his own folly?
Of a rich inherytour of an excedyng rich house, he was now made a boude man
and a swyne heard: and yet notwithstanding did not thatsame his cruel master
so much as give him meat to eat. What needs many words? so great was
the famine and houngre of the truth and grace of god (which truth only and
none but it is hable to feed and satisfy ye soul of man) that he desired to
fill his bealye he cared not wherewithal, no not if it had been with the very
husks and coddes, wherewith the hogs were fedde^ and yet was there no man
which would give him the same, in so much that he was in wurse case then the
very swine, to whom he rather was a bond servant, then a rewler or a
master over them. The very gifts of nature were now defaced in him, and had
clean forsaken the young man: and the freedom of his own will (as poor as it
was) yet lost and gone it was: and yet the stomach and appetite of his soul
being extremely corrupt, was eagre to have sum meat to appeace his hou^gre.
Every vain and void pleasure of ye world which does but for a short space
pacify, neither satisf^yng ye soul, nor making it fat, be as husks and
coddes that the swyne feed of: with these are the ill spirits delited: and
such as are their sworn serua^^es, they do rather toll and train with
those baits then fill them. And yet have they not always plenty or
abundance of these ready at hand neither, or in ease they have, yet is it
marred and disrealised with much galle of griefs and sorrows.

Well than he was now come to the point of extreme calamitye and dystresse.
But happy is that distress which constrayneth a man to amend his ill living.
Than he came to him self. etc.
For the first degree and step toward salvation is this: to call to
remembrance from whence a man is fallen, and to acknowelage how far he has
swerued and grown out of kind. And this was the fathers own drawyng unto
him. For he had gone away and leaft his father: but the father is every where
present. In times past he had been a young man past himself, and out of his
right mind, he was a man distraughte with deceytefull snares of this world,
fleeyng all such things as were only to be desired, and desiring those
things which only were to be eschewed and avoided. But the matter is than in
good state when the sinner and mysdooer thorough the secret inspiracion of his
most ientle father, And he said
cu^meth to his heart again. The young man therefore being at length cum well
to himself again, spoke to himself in this manner: from what degree to what
condition and state am I come wretched creature that I am? Out of mine own
country into exile and banishement: out of a rich and welthy house, into a
country of famine: from liberty, into servitude: from a most loving father,
to a most cruel Master: from the dignity of being a soonne in my fathers
house, to the most vileste condition of bondage that may be, and from the
feloweshyp of my brethren and of the other servants, to living among swyne.
How many hired servants are there in my fathers house, How many hired
servants at my fathers have bread enough. etc.
which through the bounty of my father, have plentiful stoore of bread at
will as much as they will eat? and I being the soonne of such a good
householder, dye here for hungre. Many of the Jews are hirelingers which do
after a sort observe the commandments of the law, not of any godly
affeccion, but either of a servile fear, orels for the reward of things
temporal: and yet a matter of so^what it is, to live as a covenant servant
with so rich and so bounteous an householder, and not to be disseuered or put
asundre from so fortunate and happy a house. For one shall of an hired servant
be made as his soonne, if he have thaffeccion that a soonne ought to have. And
a godly kind of envy it is, which provoke the young manne to the hope of
forgiveness. I will arise and go to my father. etc.
For after that he had with himself bewailed his estate of extreme myserye,
wherein he than lay altogether walowyng, he begoonne somewhat to lift and set
himself upright, and to take some heart unto him, saying: I will arise, and I
will go unto my father. And yet alas (says he to himself) how dare thou be
so bold? have thou any thing whereby to make thine excuse or pourgacion unto
him? thou fou^deste him evermore a most tender loving father, to leat thee
have all thine own will: thou did eagrely require thy childs part of his
goods, he gave it thee without once saying nay unto thee: and of thine own
mocion and dooyng it was, that thou leaftest thy father being to thee both
loving and favorable: thou have shamefully wasted thy fathers substance, And
will say to him: father I have sinned etc.
not given thee for any such purpose* Thou can impute this thy calamity to
none other person but unto thine own self. To stand in defense of this my
deed should little help or preuail, this is my only hope: forasmuch as I know
my father to be a right father in very deed, that is to say, of his own
nature a man merciful and easy to be entreated: it may so be, that some
part of his old love and charity remains still in his heart, though I have
utterly cast of al ye whole nature and duty of a true soonne. I will not go
about to make my fault and trespace light, nor I will not deny it. Plain and
simple confession of all the matter shall more weigh with him, and a mind in
very true deed mislykyng it self for his naughtiness: then the best excuse or
pourgacion yt may be made with study. The more verily that I shall hate my
self, so much the more easily shall I stir up and kendle his love toward me
again: and last of all in this my extreme desperacio^, to whom should I rather
commit my self then unto mine own father? he only and none but he is hable to
restore the trespacer that has had such a foulle fall: yea and also if there
be any in the world that will be willing to do such a good deed, it is he
that will be willing. I will not tarry till he shall know my fault, till he
shall be advertised and enfourmed of my wretched state and woeful distress by
other men then my self, who peradventure will of their instigacion rather
incense and provoke him to punish this my wickedness, then to pardon me. The
readiest way to appeace the matter and make al things quiet, shall be, if I my
self first break and show the plain case unto him even as it stands. And am
no more woorthye to be called thy soonne.
Leat him take such ways and order therein as shall please him. For he is my
father, and I am his soonne: and whatsoever I have faulted, I have faulted
against him alone. And therefore I will say unto him: father I have faulted
greatly before thaungels of god and before thee, neither do I judge my self
worthy from hence forth any more to be called by the name of thy son. I
shall think it enough if thou taking pitye and compassion on me, shall leat me
be in like place and favor with thee, as every one of thy common hired
servants be. Leat me no more but be as an hanger on in any one corner of thy
househould: there can be no fitter words framed to stir up and to enkiendle
my most singular good fathers mercy and compassion toward me. How much the
plainlyer he confesses his fault, (which fault could neither be hid, nor
yet be excused) the more that he does mislike himself, the more that he
does humble and submit himself, the more that he declares himself to have
no hope ne trust remainyng or leafte unto him, but only in his fathers grace
and mercy: so much the more shall he draw his fathers mind to do even as
he would have him to do. And this tenor and form of speaking unto his
father, no art of rhethorike had put in the young man's mind: but his own
conscience being grieved and displeased with it self, and yet not utterly
conceyuyng an extreme ill opinion (that is to say) not despairyng of his
fathers goodness.

This hope therefore and trust conceived, the young man arises, and to arise
(as I said before) is the first step and degree toward salvation. Back
goes he therefore home again all the way that he had cum, weping and sighyng
all the way, whereas he had to fore departed from his father as perte and fierce
and as rash and wilful as could be. Thus have thou a plain pattern and
exau^ple declared unto thee, of a man returnyng from extreme naughtiness: now
behold a pattern of the gracious mercifulness of god. The young man was not
yet full come to his fathers house, when his father espied him cummyng a far
of (as in deed natural fatherly love has always the iyes open and can see
far. And had compassion.
) He that did more tenderly love of the two, did first espy ye other. He saw
his soonne cummyng woondreous ougly and pieteous to behold, who had wilfully
departed from him a fierce young man, and one that would not take it as he had
dooen. And ran and fell on his neck, and kissed him.
He saw him ragged houngerstaruen, filthy, lamentyng, sighyng and weping.
This very syghte being so pieteous, begone byanby to move the fathers heart:
and whereas he had just cause to have been angrye, Father I have sinned against
heaven. etc.
this sight turned his anger into piety and compassion. He re^neth forth to
mete the young man, as the same was cummyng toward him, and not lookyng to be
prayed of his son, but being ouercu^med with natural love, caught his son
about the neck and kissed him. And albeit these things were ye sufficient
tokens of a mind ready of it self to forgive: yet the young man being angry
with himself, said: father I have done amiss and that greatly, both before
the Angels of God and before thee, and yet have I been so bold as to adventure
to come into thy sight, whereas I am unworthy any more to be called thy son,
forasmuch as all the bands of natural love and duty on my behalf have
been broken. Here in this man by the only instincte and mocion of nature being
thus affected toward his son, understand thou the goodness of God, who is
much more gracious and merciful toward a man that has been a sinner, if he
truly and unfeignedly repent and mislike himself, then any father can
possibly be toward any son, though he never so rendrelye love the same. His
son had not yet spoken all that he had conceived and recorded in his mind
before, by reason that weeping and sobbing did break his tale. But his tears
declared and spoke more the^ his words could have done. And what does his
father therewhyle, But his father said to his servants. etc
trow ye? does he speak any thoundreyng words of cruelty? does he
threaten to beat him? does he threaten to cast him of, and never to take him
any more for his son? does he cast him in the teeth with his bounteous
goodness showed unto him? does he lay to him his going away? does he
burden him with his gluttony, or other abominable points of living? he
remembers none of all this gear, he does so greatly rejoice that he has got
his son again. The son thought himself unworthy the title or name of
his son: yet the father restores him to his old state and degree again. The
son does vttrely condemn himself: and the father does absolve and quitte
him. The son did cast himself down to be a servant: And put a tyng on
his hand. etc
the father sets him perfectly again in his old state and dignity. For the
father turnyng himself to his servants, said: bring ye forth quickly his
former robe and apparel that he was wont to wear, and put it on him, and
set also a ryng on his finger, and put on a pair of shoes on his fete. And
this done, fette ye also out of my pastures thatsame best and fattest calfe
that is there, and kill it. Let us prepare a feast, and let us rejoice, for
that this my son was once dead, And leat us eat and be merry.
and is now come to life: and for that he was once perished and utterly lost,
and is now found again. So great a matier it is that a true penitent heart
may do with God. There is no punishment ministered unto him: only to be of
a penitente and coutri^e heart, suffised his most loving father. He which by
his ill demeanor had made himself unworthy to come in his fathers sight or
presence, the same did the father epsy and cast a merciful iye upon, cummyng
to wards him a great way of. He that has deserved for ever to be thrust out
of his fathers house, which being an unthankful person he had tofore
wilfully and unhonestly forsaken: to him returnyng and cu^ming home again, the
father in his own person came forth of the doors, and met him, for he has
none in all his whole house more merciful then he himself is. Him that had
cast himself into the bondeseruice of abominable masters, that is to wete,
the filthy pleasures of the body: him did his father vouchesafe to embrace in
his arms. To him that had deserved to be scourged with many a sore stripe, is
given a kiss, for a token of perfeicte love and atonement. Happy is that
sinner, whom the Lord vouchesalueth to embrace and kiss. Because he confessed
his offenses, and refused the name of a son, for that in his conscience he
knew himself faulty, there was brought forth and restored unto him all the
tokens of his old dignity. He had lost all his apparel that was mete for
such a man's son to wear: but there was brought unto him, the principal
best robe and vesture of his former innoce^cie which he had lost. He had lost
all the worthiness and dignity of a soonne of the house, by his own wilful
servitude: and yet is the ryng delivered him again. And because he should lack
nothing that might serve for the deckyng and trymmyng of him to the vttremoste,
he has shoes put on his feet. The young man himself durst not hope to have
any such thing: and how much the less he hops or looks for it, so much
the sooner does he obtain and geat it. And to thentente that none in the
house should the less esteem him or set by him for his light and homely pranke
of youth, his father as soon as ye calfe was killed, moves and provoke al
his whole householde to rejoice altogether, and allegeth good causes unto them
why they should be glad. Howsoever he has behaved himself (says he) my
son he was, he has been dead, and now is he called to life again. For sin
is the death of the soul. And he renneth toward death, which leaves and
forsakes the autour of life. He leaves and forsakes the autour of life,
whosoever is in love with the things of this world, for the worldly pleasures
are far wide from god almighties schoolyng. And such an one is revived
again, as does repent and refourme his synnefull life. He was lost without
any hope ever to be recovered again as concerning himself: howebeit he was
found and gotten again. To depart away from the fathers house, is to perish:
for out of the same house there is no health. Neither is there any way to
return, except his father self put it into his sons mind being now
brought to extremities. That the father puts the remembrance of himself in
the sons mind, is of his own beneficial goodness toward the son: but
in that the son does not neglecte it when it is so put unto him, this is
imputed to him, as a thing meritorious: and the veraye confessyng of the fault,
is received and accoumpted for satisfaccion. He was lost through his own
folly: And was found again by his fathers love. And because he repented and
emended even from the botome of the heart, forasmuch as he did vttrely myslyke
himself: his fathers mercifulness did not only restore him to his old
dignity* but made also a feast, that he might commend and settefoorth his
son to the hertie love of all that were belongyng unto him.

And such manier an one as the father here, being expressed by the similitude
of a parable, showed himself toward his son: even such ones ought curates
and bishops to show themselves toward the penitent sinner. But the proud
Phariseis (who fauouryng their own faults, do nothing but show most
cruel tyranny upon other men's faults) are far wide from this exaumple.
And behold while all the wholle house of the father, that is to say, the
wholle congregation of devout and godly persons, was altogether merry and full
of all reioycyng, The elder son was in the field.
only the brother being well resembled to the Pharisees, does envy and
grutche at it. For while these things were in doing, the elder son was not
at home, but was busily occupied in the field of Moses law, labouryng till
he sweat again with carrying the burdens of the commandments, and most
peinefullye wadyng and strougleyng to bear the heavy works of the law,
whereas the younger brother did in the mean time, receive and take the most
ientyll yoke of his father.

And when the said elder son drew nere unto his fathers house, he heard the
strange noise of them that song and daunced for joy. For stickyng wholly to
the unsavory lettre of the law, he did not know kowe great joy it is that
the spirit of the gospel has. While the Jews neglects all the premises
dooyng nothing but dig and bear burdens in the field of the law: in the
mean time is the people of the Gentiles with great joy received and taken
into the house of the father, who nothing else desires but the salvation of
his. Than the follower of the old law meruaylyng much at the strangeness of
this new matier, and woondreyng what should be the cause of such vnwoont
mirth, would not vouchesalue to enter in where he might be partaker of the
common gladness among all the rest, which thing his father did earnestelie
wish. For the Gentiles were not so received in, that the Israelites should be
excluded and shut out. But even yet still they stand without the doors,
fumyng and freating for that the church rejoices for the Gentiles received to
the salvation of the gospel.

The elder son therefore called out one of his fathers servants, and
demanded of him what new joy and gladness all thissame was. And called one
of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
He made au^swer, your brother is come: whom, when your father had gotten
again, he was veraye glad, and killed thatsame principal best calfe which he
had so long fatted, because he had him safe and sound again, whom he thought to
had been vttrely lost for ever. Here behold a Judicial heart and stomach:
which whereas it ought to have rejoiced for the receiving of his brother, which
ought to have praised the mercifulness of his father: yet had rather to envy
his brother, and to take indignacion against his father. He carried still
therefore without the doors, murmouryng and full of chafyng. And when his most
loving father had perceived him, who desired the joy to be in common to all
that were of his house: he went unto him and begone courteously to pray him,
that casting all envy and grutche out of his stomach, he would come in, and
make one at the feast among all the rest, and would be partaker of his
fathers joy.

Yet would not the elder son any thing bough or relente with this his fathers
courteous entreatyng, but proudely quereled and reasoned the mattier with his
father, and unnaturally accuses his brother. Behold (says he) so many years
am I as a bondeseruaunte to you within your house, Lo, these many years have I
doe^ thee service etc.
nor never brake or transgressed any commandment of yours, and yet this my
godly obedience has never been regarded. For ye never gave me so much as a
young kidde wherewith I might make merry among my friends. But now that thissame
son of yours, who has wasted and spent your substance on whoores and
harlottes, is come home again: ye have killed for him thatsame your principal
best and fattest calfe.

Do thou not, Theophilus, think thy self to see this elder son to enter
in fumyng and chafyng, and thus murmouring against his father, when thou
read of the Phariseis backebityng Christ because he did eat with
Publicanes and sinners? when thou read of the Jews repinyng against the
Greeks for that the same Greeks were admitted to the ministry and office of
Apostles? when thou read the same Jews scoldyng and raylyng without end,
that the gentyles leauyng their ydolatry, without the burden of the law, by
faith only should be admitted to the grace of the gospel, and should be
baptized, and so confyrmed with the holy ghost? when thou read of them
having envy, that they absteynyng from the feast, the congregation and church
of the Gentiles with an unspeakable joy of the spirit, does eat thatsame
special goodly calfe, whom the father commanded to be slain for the
rede^pcion of the whole world? And yet this man also being a murmourer, as he
is, the gracious goodness of his most good father goes about to appeace.
Son (says he) thou shall fare never a whit the wurse for that, though I use
ientilnesse and mercy toward thy brother. For thou art continually with me,
and all that is mine is thine. For continual felicity never interrupted or
broken of, has not so much pleasure or delectacion in it. But like as a
disease or sickness before going does commend health unto us, It was mete
that we should make merry etc.
and make it seem the sweter unto us after we be restored to it again: even
so the misfortune which I have had before for my son, makes our mirth now the
more, for that he is gotten again.

And thou ought to rejoice in thy brothers behalf, and not to be away from
the mirth of this feast, for because thissame thy brother was once dead, and
is returned to life again, he was once lost, and is now found again.
Therefore do not thou think that he is returned home to thee the same man
that he was: but think him of an unthrift to be new borne an honest and
well disposed manne. Thou must not remember what he has been: but be glad
that he is now become such an one, as we wish and desire to have him.

With these three parables the Lord did exhort all his disciples to mercy
and ientilnesse in receiving of sinners. For the glory of God is never more
showed or better set forth, then when he which was very notoriously eiuil,
is suddenly by the grace of God made a new manne: of an ydolatre, made the
servant of Jesus Christ: of a rauiner, and extorcioner, made a defendour and
helper of the poor: of an unchaste liver, made chaste: of an ambicious
person, brought to humility: of a revenger, changed into a bearer and long
sufferer. Furthermore the younger son found his fathers mind so much the
more redier to forgive him, for that the Gentiles which did not know God,
faulted against him more through ignorance, then of any stubberne or indurate
pretensed malice. For ignorance and lack of thynkyng and castyng before what
will come after, is always for the most part joined and coupled with youth.
And therefore so much the more willingly we do forgive youth, and bear the
more with this age when it does offend. But the Jew, which to himself
seems just, and stands much in his own conceypte for fulfillyng of the
law, does trespace more grievously with envying against his brother, then
the other had sinned by sweruyng and strayghyng out of the right way.

The.xvi. Chapter.

ANd all thissame that has hitherto been said, did most specially, and most
directely touch the Pharisees, taking much indignacion, that the Lord Jesus,
as one that remembered not his own high dignity, did receive Publicanes and
known sinners to the familiar co^uersacion of living with him in coumpaynye.
But anon after, he returning to his disciples, advised and exhorted them to a
more larger fauourablenesse, that they should not only not murmour against the
goodness of God: but also they should by all means and ways possible, follow
the same goodness of God on their own behalfes: earnestly applying theimselues
to do their neighbor good by every occasion: relieuyng the same with succoure
of things necessary for the body: easyng their hertes with words of
coumfort: exhortyng them to goodness: teaching them what they ought to do:
admonishyng them when they did amiss: and forgeuyng them when they trespaced
against them. And where he would teach us that our ientle goodness in thus
dooyng shall not perish to us ward, but that contrariwyse, it is laid up in
store for us against the life to come, whatsoever thing is here bestowed on our
neighbor: he propouned forth this sentence by a parable of such sort as
follows. A certain great rich man there was, who had committed the bestowyng
and housebandyng of all his goods and things unto a steward of his. This
steward was complained on to his Lord, that being more prodigal then reason
was, he wasted and consumed his gooddes away. The Lord therefore calling for
his steward, said unto him: why do I hear this brute and fame of thee? Come
on, make thine audyte and accoumpt of thy stewardship: For I am not minded ne
wyllyng, that thou shall any longer have the ordreyng or disposicion of any
more gooddes of mine. But the steward as soon as he understood that it was
like within a litell short time to come to pass, that he should be put out of
his office of steward, did in ye same litell short time subtly and craftily
provide for himself. Some men have richesse, some men have learning, others
have experience of the world, and so one man has one quality, and another
man another. And what thing every person has whereby he may be hable to do
his neighbor good, it is the substance of our rich Lord and Master: which
substance it is our office vountifully to bestow on our neighbor. For no
mortal man is himself the lord of such qualities and gifts as he has, but
a steward and a dispensour only. This office of dispensyng is soon taken
away. For all the life here in this world is but short, and after this life
there is no longer power ne liberty to do good. And a plain waster is that
manne of the lords substance, whosoever bestows after his own affeccion
that that he has, and does not with part thereof relieve his neighbor. The
steward therefore being sure within a little time to be removed from his
stewardeship: consulteth with his own mind, and advises himself, saying:
What shall I do, for my master takes from me the stewardship. etc
what shall I now best do, seeing that my lord and Master takes away from
me the power and office any longer to have the dispensyng of his gooddes? And
whereon to live I have not. For I gathered nothing together for mine own
behoufe while I might have done. There is nothing left now for me to do, but
either to dig in the field for hire wages from day to day, or else to go
about every where on begging. But to dig and delue I lack strength, and to
beg I am ashamed. But (as hap is) I have even now suddenly devised in my
brain, how to make a ioly provision for my self. I will procure and geat my
self some friends with my masters gooddes. And the said friends bearyng well
in mind my beneficial goodness toward them, will receive me into their
houses, when I am put out of mine office of stewardship. Hereupon he calls
together all his masters debtours, one by one, and saeyth unto the first: how
much art thou behind with my master endebted unto him? the party
answered: An hundred bates of oil, (and a bate as some writers do accoumpte,
Take thy bill. etc. and write fifty.
was a kind of measure among the Hebrews, conteynyng seven gallons of
liquour, or theraboute.) Than (quod the steward) have here, take thine
obligacion, and sitting down quickly, write thou fifty instead of an hundred.
My master is rich enoughe, I will have thee save the one moytie clear to
thine own advantage by my good help. This done, he said to the secounde: and
how much oughest thou? who answered: an hundred quarters of wheat. Than
(quod the steward:) take the bille of thy hand, and write four score. As for
twenty quarters, when it is abated, my master will never perceive: and to
thee being a poor man, twenty quarters saved will do good service and stead.
And after the same sort played he with the other debtours also. In case this
fraud had been espied or known to the foresaid rich man: his steward had
never escaped unpunished for it: But yet the lord Jesus for an exaumple of
beneficial liberality, praised unto his disciples, ye devise of the said
steward, though guylefull, yet wise and politic: and exhorted al his to the
following of him: giving a sharp check to our sluggishnesse, in that, that men
seruyng this world, are more provident and forecastyng, and also more dilligent
and industrious in prouydyng for their bodily susteynaunce and living, then
such persons (who having clearly renounced the world, do ensue things
eternal) are in making provision for themselves toward the everlasting life
in heaven. And a foul shame it is for us that they in their kind are so wise
and so full of good provision, all the buisinesse being only for light
trifiyng matiers, and things that shall anon after come to nothing: when we
are slack by dooyng good turns and pleasures to our neighbor, to purchase
and geat sure stays of the life immortal: seeing that by reason of the
uncertain term of this present life, every of us ought to look for no less to
cum, but that we must hear spoken to us by our master, the words which the
said steward heard spoken unto him: Thou may no more from this time
forward exercise or occupy thy room of steward.

And this time for as much as it is both to every man uncertain when it
shall come, Make you friends of the unrighteous Ma^mon.
and also otherwise to no man any better then a thing of veraye short
continuance, we must make have, that al our worldly goods bestowed on the
poor in the way of alms, we may prepare and geat our selves provision to
serve and bring us to the life everlasting. For by that means shall it come to
pass, that we also shall be made partakers of the good deeds which other men
have done, for as much as we have with our temporal goods helped them. For
whosoever does with part of his substance help to aid and maynteyn any man
being buisily occupied about the cause or affairs of the gospel to be
settefoorth: the same shall again in the kingdom of heaven be relieved and made
partaker of the well doings of an Evangelist, that is to say, a writer or a
preacher of the gospel.

Therefore said the lord: That when ye shall have need, they may receive you
into everlasting habitacio^s.
And take ye good ways for your selfs in season while time is, after the
exaumple of the said worldely wise and politic steward. Procure unto your
selfs good friends of an evil thing, to thend that at such time when ye shall
at the commandment of the lord be compel^ed to depart out of the tabernacle
of this mortal body, they may receive you into tabernacles everlasting. An
happy permutacion it is, when transitory things make change with things
eternal. And what is more vile, or ferther from virtue, then the richesse of
this world? They are uneath at any time gotten without guile and falsehode.
And other ways or means, either to save them, or else to increase them, there
is none, but the same that they are gotten by. It is a possession of much
buisinesse and encoumbraunce, and yet is it neither out of daungier of
miscarriyng there while, ne any way a thing of long contynuaunce. For they
follow not their master when he departs hens, yet notwithstanding with
the same a man may bye that is everlasting, and which may do him good stead and
service in the life to cum. So it shall cum to pass, that the thing which in
case it be hoorded up and hidden, makes a man unrighteous and thrall to many
cares: the same, if it be laid out and bestowed in dooyng charity, shall be an
instrument of eua^gelicall righteousness, while both he that is a minister of
the gospel, is relieved with necessaries, and a reward cummeth to the geuer
with a large increase of entresse.

Whosoever, as a steward, has the disposyng and beestowyng of a mortal man's
gooddes, by such means and none else is found to be faithful and trusty, if
he after a very pynchyng sort bestow that he is put in trust withal. But
contrariewyse God, who is rich for and toward all creatures, would fain have
it most bountifully laid out, that he has purposely delivered out of his
hands to be eueriwhere distributed: and takes him for an untrusty servant,
whosoever keeps to himself as his own propre goods, that the lords will and
mind was to be made common to al people as often as the necessity of the
neighbor does so require.

Therefore, whosoever in disposing of a thing of the least value possible, behaueth
himself otherwise then his most liberal master would have him, He that is
faitheful in that which is least is faithful also in much.
shall he not seem a person unworthy, to whose honesty his master should
commit the dispensacion of higher things? All that ever we have, is the
lords and not ours: corporal richesse, and whatsoever this world produces,
is the only bounteous goodness of God. The doctrine of the gospel, and the
other ghostly gifts, are the goods of almighty god, not for any such
purpose given unto us, that our selfs and no mo should have the fruicio^ of
the same: but to bestow them like good stewardes to the utility and profit of
our neighbor. But thus much odds there is between those two sorts of goods
or treasours, that such things as pertein to cou^fortyng or cherishyng of the
body (because they be without us and not in us) they neither be our propre
own, nor continual unto us. They are the goods of the world rather then
ours. Moreover because they have an outward likeness of felicity after ye
world, (whereas in very deed, they are a sore let and hinderaunce to the
happy or blissful state of man,) they be not the thing neither, that they
are named to be. For they are named goods, whereas in very deed they are the
things which bring a man to the state of extreme misery and wretchedness.
The richesse therefore of the mind and soul are the true richesse in deed, and
riches that may be called our own: not as though we were not bound to God
for them, but because they leave not their possessour in the life to come, at
lestwise if a man use them now in this present life as he ought to do: And
like as in a common weal no man is auaunced to the head office of gouernoure,
as maiouraltie or such others, except he have first in the room of
Counstable, and in such other inferior offices showed an ensaumple of his
perfy^e honesty and vprightenesse: and as in a private family the
distrybutynge of precious things is not committed, but to such an one as has
evidently showed himself faithful to fore in matters of less weight: so does
the lord teach us, that the dispensacion and bestowing of the richesse
evangelical (which only and none else are true richesse in deed, and our
propre own) is not to be put to the credit and trust of such an one, And
he that is unrighteous in that least. etc.
as has nothing faithfully distributed money, being a thing, as most vileste
of all, even so being an other ma^s and none of his own. For whosoever cannot
set worldly richesse at naught, will not syncerely distribute the richesse
of the soul. And the lord still beating such things into the minds of his
disciples, said: whosoever is faithful in a thing of least value, it is a very
great likelihode, that the same will be faithful in a great matter too. And
again he that is unjust in a little thing, will be unjust in a great matter
also. For that man, whose heart the care of a thing nothing worth in the world
may be hable to move to do amysse: will much sooner with a greatter
occasion be drawn to do amysse. That if in the wicked Mammon, that is to
say, in false riches and goods gotten with falsehood (as commonly in very
true deed it is) ye shall not show yourselfes faithful to the Lord who has
delivered you the same to be disbursed and distributed abroad: what manne will
commytte unto you the bestowyng of the true richesse of the mind? And if in a
thing of an other man's, which can not perpetually continue with any man,
ye have been nothing trusty, who will put in your hands such a thing as
might perpetually in time to come be your own? And a lighter offense and
trespace does he, which vnfeythfully handles the richesse of this world,
then he which vnfeythfully dispe^seth the treasoures of the gospel. The
kingdom of god requires to have all the whole man. And the mind it requires
to have free from the love of all worldely things. No servant can serve two
masters. etc.
Neither is it for any man to attempt or go about to make a medley of the
world and the gospel together, which gospel is the kingdom of heaven.
For if no man can be a servant common and indifferente unto two masters at
once, (because that scarcely any two men do so well agree within themselves,
that one servant is hable with his due attendaunce to satisfye them both at
once, but that, the one or the other set at naught, he must of force be
compelled to stick to the one of them alone:) how much less can ye be hable
to serve God and Mammon both at once, being masters so far discordyng
together, that there is not so much as any one poynct wherein they agree? And
servant unto Mammon is that man, what ever he be, that sets a great piece
of his heaven in richesse, and for that cause labors with all earnest
applying of his mind to geat very great abundance, and the same to uphold,
maynteine, and encreace, when it is gotten. And such an one leapeth for joy,
when his substance multiplieth, and is sore vexed in his heart, if it be taken
away from him by any misfortune. And servant to God is he, who either
shaking of from him the gooddes of this world, or else possessyng them, as
though he possessed them not, does with all earnest applying of himself, go
about the provision of the things, which make to everlasting salvation.

All the words and talk before going, (though it were specially and purposely
spoken to such, as believed themselves possible enough to be Christ's
disciples, though they were charged and laden with the carfulness of richesse)
the Phariseis also did hear, whose hertes being as it were old bo^tels, could
not hold ne receive this new must of the doctrine evangelical. For they were
covetous and gredie not only of money, but also of glory. They were haulte
minded, fierce, and men that would be avenged of every matier. Therefore they
skorned the doctrine of Jesus, who moved me^ to charitable liberality, to not
caryng for to be avenged, to the not passing on glory, ne on their life
neither. And certes this world also has and evermore shall have, his
Phariseis, who trustyng to their own force, will have in derision the doctrine
of humility, of favor in pardonyng offenses, of tractablenesse, and of
liberality. A mouth enured and accustomed to ye sour turned wine of worldly
wisdom and policy, abhors from this heavenly must. May it also please
God to vouchesalue one day, to dampe the tauntyng mockes of such persons,
likewise as he did at this present sharply reprove these Phariseis being
scorners, when he said: Ye swell in pride with the vayn countrefaictes of
goodness, setting forth your peynted sheathe in the face of men, who esteem a
man of his riches, of his gaye apparel, Ye are they which justify your selves
before men.
of the obseruacion of ceremonies: and of those things do ye purchase unto
your selves also a laud and praise of holiness, where in very deed ye are
neither rich, nor holy, nor in happy or blissful state, nor yet great men.
For god, who only sees and beholds your hertes, estemeth a man by the very
goods of the soul. And such a man and none other is rich, who is rych
before God: But God knows your hertes
he is just, that is just in the sight of God: that man is great, who being
little in his own estimacion, is great by the judgment of God. For most
commonly it chances, that such a thing as to men seems some high matier,
and to be had in high veneracion, is with God reputed a thing abominable.

Ye do yet still hold the rynde of the law fast in your teeth, and ye glory
in the shadows of things: whereas now the kernel within is to be opened,
that the light of evangelical truth arisyng, may on every side drive away
all shadows. Ye must now disacouainte and estraunge your selves from ye ^oure
old wine of Moses law, and drink in the new must of more sou^der doctrine.
The figures of the law had their time: What the holy sayings of the prophets
did promise, was looked for. But figures cease now that the truth has
appeared forth: neither is prophetical promisyng any longer looked for, now
that the thing which they had promised, is in very fact performed and
given. From shadows ye must go foreward and grow to the verity. And from
the feith of the promyses, ye must grow up to the love of the thing being now
sent and given in deed. John was (as ye would say) a marchyng bordre or a
particion diuidyng and seueryng the law with his figures, and the prophets
with their promises, from the gospel: which gospel does in very fact and
deed give, as well that the law had with his figures signified and appoyncted,
as also that the prophets being enspired with God had promised should come.
John preached that the kingdom of God was already come. And that very thing
forsouthe it is which the law had in shadows marked out: and that very thing
it is, that the prophets solemnly spoke of before. And ye see the thing self
to be agreeable to John's preaching. For ever sense his time the kingdom of God
is continually preached unto al people, and many do with glad hertes gredely
take the blissful and heavenly news. They drink new must, they take the
doctrine of God: they contemn yearthly things, and grow rich with goods
and treasoures heavenly. And every (...) strives (...) in.
They cast money away from them, but they work miracles: they have no armor
ne weapon, but they cast out devils. They are not men of wealth, or richesse,
of power, of glory and renoume in worldely estimacion. But in humility, in
tractablenesse, in pacient suffreaunce, in charitable geuyng, and in the other
goods of the mind, they are in veraye true deed, both rich, and men of
power, and also full of glory in the sight of God. And ye high pathwaye unto
this felicity is shut up to no man. That if ye Pharisees will not
vouchesalue to enter, others will prevent you, and take up your roumes: the
Gentiles will enter in, and all the nations of the world will enter in. They
cannot be kept out now that the door is set open: they break in by plain
force and violence, if they be not received in. Ye see publicanes, soldiers,
sinners, and harlotes how they come rennyng thither. These sorts of people
despisyng all that ever they are oweners of, contemnyng all volupteous
pleasures of this world, trustyng to the promises of the gospel, do with
all their heart apply theimselfes to the true gooddes of the mind: and
whereas ye stand without doors (whose parts it had been first of all others
to enter, yea and also to bring in others which would enter:) they whom I
have rehearsed, do through the feruentenesse of feith, through their
promptenesse of mind, break in whether we will or will not. And such kind
of violence does the kingdom of heaven love. Neither is there any cause why
for the affeccionate lovers of the law, to make such a great criyng out, that
the law is now abrogate, that the prophets are now abolished. Nay thissame
is not an abolishyng of the law, but an acco^plishing and perfeictyng thereof.
For mothers do not use to make weping and wailling that their soonne is
lost, when he is of a boy weaxed and grown up to be a man. Now a very
great point of folly it were, for one to enbrace in his arms the
counterfaicte porterature of a man, when he may enbrace the verai man's self
who was so portured out: and no less poyncte of folly to speak to ye maker of
a promise, when one may be sure (if he will) to have presentely in his
hands, the very thyngselfe that was promised. The thing than must be compared
with the image, and in case they do agree the one with the other, than
acknowlage thou the thing that has been set out in shadows, and enbrace
thou, that is performed and given, in fact. If the proof of ye things do
agree with the promises of the prophets, discharge them as true men of their
promise, and enbrace thou that is truly performed and brought to effect. And
ferthermore, if thou se with thine iyes right many things to have come to
pass, which were marked out by the shadows of the law, (for the law is
spiritual and ghostly* Whosoeue^ forsakethe his wife and maryeth an other
commits aduoutrye.
) if in a great maignie causes, the end and proof of the matter be aunswerable
to the old and ancient foresaiynges of the prophets: than believe thou that
all the other things also shall with semblable assurance be performed in
time to come, whatsoever the law the prophets have said shall hereafter come
to pass. What in the law was carnal and gross, the same give the place to
things of more perfeccion: but what in the same is spiritual, thatsame not
only is not abrogate or fordoen: but also is brought to his just and full
perfeccion. For the law permits to ye wedded houseband upon geuyng his wife
a testimonial of her diuorcemente, that he may put his wife away from him,
and bring an other new wife home in her stead: but by the law of the
gospel, whosoever refusyng his true wedded wife, maryeth an other, does
commit aduoutrie. And he that maryeth the woman divorced commits
aduoutrie. For neither of the men has his own wife, nor neither of the weomen
her own housebande. And as well the common reason of nature, as also
evangelical sinceritye does in all earnest wise require perpetual amity
without any breach, and an union not possible to be dissolved or plucked in
sondre, not only in matrimony, but also in all friendship. Neither is there any
occasion or ground why any should find cauillacions that the doctrine of the
gospel is repugnau^t to the things prescribed by Moses. For Moses in
consideracion of your hardenes of heart, durst not precisely require of you the
thing that he rather wished, then conceived any hope of, and sore against his
mind did he leat you have diuorcemente at your wills, lest if it had been
denied, your hatred against your wives would have braste out into some more
furious and cruel deeds of mischief toward the^. He therefore which requires
that is of more perfeccion, does make up the law, and not abrogate ye law:
Easier it is for heaven and earth to perish^. etc.
as a father is not contrary to himself, if the same having a great while before
been somewhat with the tendrest over his son to leat him have his own bridle
while he was of tender age, do require more of him when he is come to full age,
the^ he did require of him before. And as for this I assure you of, (and say I
told it you:) that both ye sky and the earth (and yet is there nothing that
shall longer endure then those two,) shall yet both of them sooner pass, then
any one little io^e or title of the law shall perish, but that al be performed
whatsoever has been foresaied or prophesied: ^o veraye true it is, that I am
not come to be an abolisher of the law.

Now because the Lord Jesus under a parable of a wilye stewarde^ little before
by him propouned, had exhorted men to exercise charitable liberality
toward the nedye, to the end the same parties might after this life receive
us into everlasting habitacions, at what time they by a contrary chau^g and
course of things shall be ple^teously endewed with all good things: and the
rich, who had their heaven before here in this world, shall lie in peines and
be tormented with all extremities of woe and distress: he here (as it were in
a plain picture) sets out an exaumple of the thing, to the intent it should
cleue and stick the faster in me^nes minds. There was once (says he) a
great rich man, who seemed to lack no manier thing to the highest degree of
fortunate and happy state of this world, a man of great name and much
spoken of among men, but of no name at al ne acquaintance with God. This man
went apparelled in his purple and his veluettes, no less nicely then
gorgeously. And because he would lack nothing for the delectacion of his body,
he would day by day have his delicate fare, and his banquettinges, and would be
served after a portely sort and princely, as a man which al in one was a bond
servant as well to ambicion, as also to gluttonous excess, and to
volupteousnes. There was also at the same time, a certain beggar much unlike
unto this man, that is to say, a fellow of low birth, a fellow destitute of any
acquaintance among men, but famous and noble before God. For he had his name
eue^ of the state and case y^ he was in, And there was a certain beggar nam^d
Lazarus. etc.
called Lazarus, because he was a man destitute of al worldly staigh or
maintenance, and rested only on the help of God alone. This Lazarus had
neither house nor apparel, ne meat, no nor yet prospe^ous health* of his
body. For he was al full of sores and botches in his body, even such an
other in manier, as it is read in scripture, yt Job was. This Lazarus was liyng
at the said rich man's gate, loking that some relief should have be sent
him of the crummes and scrappes, which fell from the rich man's table,
wherewith to swage the gredinesse of his stomach, now fretting and gnawyng, and
as ye might say, even barkyng for hungre. The Lazaro man being full of botches
and blames, might not be suffered to come in, lest with the syghte of him
being deadly to behold, he might have been an iyesore to all the cou^paignie,
and might turn the merye there of all the whole feast into sadness, whereas
in all other behalfes it was all neat and fienely appoyncted. Thou heareste
now the pompous pride of welthinesse: but among all this excessive fare, and
wastefull prodigality otherwise, yet was there so much pinchyng and
niggardship toward the neighbor being at the very poynct to dye for hou^gre:
that there might not so much as the crummes and scrappes be given him, when he
made earneste peticion for them, whereas the dogs were fed there eue^
panchefull, with great lumpes and whole loaves of good bread. Yea and the
dogs do even in the very teeth lay inhumanitie and vncurtesie to the rich
man, The dogs came (...) and li^ked his sores.
swimming above the cares in his deliciousness. For the dogs came and licked
the sores of Lazarus. Who would not have judged that same rich man to have
been a perfect exaumple and pattern of most welthie and happy state: and this
poor Lazate man to be a pattern of utter misery? But felicity is in ^owyse
to be measured by such things as fortune gives to men in this life. But in
the matter that we now speak of, altogether was suddenly turned in and out
clean arsie versy. For death hanging over the head of every creature, like as
it is unto rich folks an end of al sensual pleasures, so unto them which
live in care and woe it is an end of all sorrows. For so it fortuned, that the
beggar dyed: and where he was nothing passed on ne regarded among men during
his life time: as soon as he was dead, he was of the Aungelles carried into
the lap of Abraham. God vouchsalued to show him thus much honor, whom the
rich manne would not vouchesalue to leate be within his house. And even at the
very self same time dyed the same rich man too. For death alone being egually
indifferente unto al folks, teaches the rich sore this lesson, that they are
men too, as well as others. And as for the Lazare man had not so much as the
honestee of burial, to be laid in a grave: but the rich man was carried to his
burial with as great solemnity as might be about a corpse. But when they were
both departed out of this world, and the rich man in hell, liyng there in
grievous torments, and was no less hardely handled as well with the lack of
things delectable, as also with the abundance of all kinds of euyls, then
he had during his life time cherished himself nicely and deintilye: at last
liftyng up his iyes, he saw Abraham a great way of: he also espied Lazarus
and knew him of old whom he had suffered before to lie as an abject at his
gate, and saw him in Abraham's lap taking the full fruicion of most perfect
quiet and consolacion, in the most sweet and tender enbracyng of the same his
most holy father. For Abraham acknowlaged him for his son, whom the rich
man would not vouchesalue to acknowelage for a man. The sight of an other
man's bliss in heaven, was to him an increase of his torments. And here in
this case the rich man being in vain become a fair mouthed crauer and a
beggar, cried with a pieteous noise: O good father Abraham, And he cried.
Father Abraham have mercy upon me.
have thou piety and compassion upon me, and send Lazarus to diepe but even
the tippe of his finger in the water, that he may but even so much as ous
cool my toungue with one litel drop and no more, so sore am I tormented in
this burning fire. To whom Abraham answered. Soonne the coolyng and
refreashyng which thou doeste now ouerlate make peticion for, thou shouldeste
with refreashyng of thy poor neighbor have purchased for thy self when thou
were living. But at that time thou thinkyng thy self well, with the present
things of the world which thou had tha^, wouldeste not vouchsalue so much
as with the crummes of thy table to relieve Lazarus being ready to dye for
houngrie. Know thou now the course of things to be rightefully changed.
This must thou know, (if thou be disposed to call it to thy remembrance,)
that in thy life time thou have received thy gooddes: and Lazarus contrariwise
passed over al his e^uils, and missehappes in his life time. Now altogether
turned vpsyde down, he here, after many told affliccio^s patiently suffered, is
refreashed: and thou after al delicious sensualitye wherewith thou have
naughtily taken thine own pleasure, art worthyly tormented. Thou turnedst thy
face from the Lazare being full of sores, and biddedst away with him out of thy
sight, whereas for thine own part thou were all in thy sweet sauoures and
perfumes: and now is he in mine arms, smooth and clear skynned from top to
toe. Thou wouldeste not vouchsalue to leate him come within thy house: and I am
content to have him sytte in my lap. Thou did neither with meat ne
drink refreash him being in extreme penury, and now is he refreashed with
eternal rest, which knows no vexacion of houngre ne thirste. And with what
face dooest thou at his hand ask refreasheme^t of cooling thy mouth: seeing
that he not veraye long sens, could obtain no refreashyng at all of the? In
case thou had cladde him when he was naked, if thou had fed him when
he was houngrie, if thou had given him drink in his thirst, if, when he
lay without thy gates, thou had gathered him into thy house, if thou
had done some cure on him being all full of sores: he would now again
obtein some coumforte for thee, and some releace of thy torments, and would
receive the again on his party, into his brotherhoode and coumpaignie Thou
wreatched miser, where is now thy fine silks and thy purple? where be thy
perfumes? where be thy feastinges and ba^quettynges? where is thy pipyng and
dauncyng? where be so many thy pleasures mixed with ambicion and vain glory?
While thou were alive, no kind of wine could please thee for being cloyed with
them, Between us and you there is a great space set:
so great was the deliciousness of thy mouth, neither wouldeste thou all the
while so much as give a little water to Lazarus being thirsty: and now thou
can not obtain, no not so much as a poor drop of water to refreashe the
scaldyng heat of thy tongue. Instead of thy galaunte manours which thou
haddeste than, thou haste now the derke doungeon of hell: for thy delicate
pastimes, everlasting peine, for thy testynges and songs, continual weeping
and owlyng. And so much ye more past remedy is your extreme distress, that an
huige great gapyng hole does keep us and you in soondre, in sort, that if
any would gooe from hens thither where ye are, and help you, they cannot: nor
if any of you would assay to come up from thens hither he cannot, now that by
the judgment of God (which cannot be changed,) there is unto al sorts their
due place limited for them to remain in. In the life season, there was a time
to refreashe ye neighbor by doing good turns and pleasures one man to an
other, and to be relieved the one of the other again: now is it over late here
to will or desire, that cannot possibly be done. In thy delicate pleasant
pastimes thou wouldeste needs be alone with such as thou were thy self: but
Lazarus, and such other as Lazarus was, thou would not suffer to come ons in
thy coumpaignie. And now art thou again served of the same sauce for thy
labor. Wha^ Abraham had this spoken, the rich man being put of from all hope
that himself should obtain any relief, is desirous at leastwise to provide
some good ways for certain brethren of his, which he had yet alive, lest that
if they ledyng their lives after the same facion, should come into the same
place, the felyng of his peine and woe, should by such coumpaignie being
joined unto him, increace unto him, whereas he was in myserie and extremity
enough al ready. But he does now in vain become an humble suitor, which
tofore used to put of from him the lazare man, when the same made much
crouchyng and knelyng unto him for succor. If the great derke doungeon (says
he) be a let, yt there can no help be ministered or dooen to my self, yet
thus much I pray thee, that thou will send Lazarus to my fathers house: (For I
have five brethren alive) that he may give warnyng and aduertisemente unto
them, lest that, in case they follow my steps, Than he said: I ^raye thee
send him to my fathers house. etc.
they shall come hither to be fellows and partakers here with me of these
woeful sorrows and peines that I am in. But rather leat them relieve the
necessity of the poor with such gooddes as they have, and leate them not use
their richesse to the sensuality of the fleash, but to the godly devotion of
the mind, ne leate them not set their fansye and love on such things as
for a season are swear and delectable in the worldly life: but on such things
as may purchase rest for ever to endure. Thus said the rich man, whom the
extrem^ torments which he now had experience of, made both an humble
suppliaunte, and also a teacher of other, though it were now over late. But
after death there is no prayers that will serve: ne yet may a man have license
to give any warning or counsel. For nothing have the dead to do with the
living. Abraham therefore made him this answer. It is nothing requisite that
Lazarus be for any such cause as this called away from his quiet rest.
Thy brethren, (if they be disposed to be honest men and to do well,) have
Moses and the prophets, leat them harken to them. For they in their books
speak unto al creatures. Than the rich man being an hard suitor, and a
peticioner that would not be satisfied, (yet nevertheless ouerlate) said to
Abraham: O father Abraham, as for Moses they will not hear no nor the
prophets neither: but if one of the dead might come to them, to bring them
sure and perfect word, But if one come to them from the dead they will
repent. etc.
how sore and grievous torments tho persons do here suffer, which do
there pass their lives after mine exaumple, which all rich folks for the
most part do, they will amend and frame theimselfes to better rewle and
governance: Hereunto Abraham said: yea, that thou speakeste, is the colorable
laiyng of excuses of such persons as are disposed never to leave, ne forsake
that they do naughtily and viciously love. The authority of Moses and of the
prophets is greater with them, then the authority of Lazarus a poor beggar
should be. That if they give no ear ne regard to them: truly if one should
arise again from death to life, they would not hear him neither. Than would
they find stoppes and cauillacions, that it were the walkyng of some ghost,
or to be some eiuill spirit. By these words did the Lord Jesus couertely
give a nippe to the unbelief of the Iewishe nation, who because they did not
in verai true deed believe Moses and the prophets, do even yet still at this
present cry out against Christ also being restored alive out of his
sepulcher, and now sitting on the right hand of his father, whereas in
veraye deed they would believe that has be done, if they had truly believed
Moses and the prophets tellyng and showing long before, that it should so be.
By this parable did Christ coumforte his disciples, who should afterward for
the love of the kingdom of heaven, endure and abide many affliccions in this
world: and by the selfsame parable does he fear the phariseis, the
Scribes, the expert lawyers, the priests, the headmen, the rich folks, the
proud sort, the fierce perilous men, and such as live to the behoufe and
commodity of themselfes and no mo: to the end they might at leastwyse for
fear of punishemente (if they would none otherwise) refourme their ungodly
life. For otherwise it should come to pass, that they should there an other
day be mocked again, which here in this world were mockers and skorners of
Christ, when he called them to better ways.

The xvii. Chapter.

NOw, so was it decreed by the heavenly father* and so was it expedient for ye
salvation of mankind, yt the proud Phariseis should be offended with the
weakness of ye humain body and nature, which the Lord had taken: and that
the same Phariseis should punish him with affliccion, yea and also should
put him to death being in form of poverty and of low degree, and brought
in form of mekenes and humility: and yt they should also be in mind to show
never a whit more of mercy or favor to his disciples neither, if they followed
the steps of their master. But as the unbelief of the eiuil disposed and
ungracious sort, does wrappe the godly in affliccions: so is ye pacient
suffreing which the good me^ have in them, an occasion of the greater da^nacion
to ye eiuil. But yet nevertheless, God uses the malice of such, far
otherwise the^ they mean it, to ye benefit of ye whole world. Jesus therefore
says unto his disciples, among who^ was Judas, who was afterward to be the
causer and first beginner of offense (that is to say of slaundre and grutche
of conscience) and an occasioner to betray Jesus unto death, being a man after
the worldly estimacion selie and of low degree. Albeit y^ wickedness of the
said Judas made ye rede^pcion of the world the sooner to come and his damnable
end was an wholesome ensaumple to all creatures. It cannot be avoided ne chosen
(says Jesus) but yt offenses must and shall happen: but yet is yt none excuse
to him through whose default such offense of conscience shall arise. It cannot
be but offenses will come.
For it were a great deie more expedient for such an one, to be cast headlo^g
into the sea with a great lidger millstone tied about his neck, then to be an
occasion of such slaundre or offense to one of these that are such little
tender ones to the worldeward. For they have God to be an auenger of their
cause: who thinks himself to be hurted in the same litell ones, when they
are hurted. And a less my sauenture it is for a man to endure punishment here
in this world, (be it never so sharp,) then by offending the consciences of
little ones, who^ God loves, wilfully to seek and procure everlasting torments
in hell. Beware ye therefore. It lies not in you to avoid, but yt such
slaundres of conscience shall arise: but it is your parts to beware that none
such arise through your fault or occasion. And the best way or mean how for
you to avoid that no such offense of conscience may be imputed to you, is,
if not only ye shall not give any occasion of slaundre or offense of
conscience to any body through your fault, but also if any such thing be
ministered unto you by others, ye either wype it cle^e away through your
mildness, or else suffer it with your good exaumple of patience, and in no
wise do the like to any of them again. For ye shall have vexacion and
vproares arise against you, not at the hands of the wicked sort only, but
also being, as ye are, mortal men made of frail metalle, there shall even
among your selfs many times arise offenses and trespaces, which ye must
remedy with brotherlye and charitable admonicion, If thy brother trespace
against thee rebuke him,
whose proprety and condition is, neither to bewraye or disclose the offendour,
if there may be any reformacion in him: and yet to have pardone ready for
him, in case he repent and be willing to emende. If therefore it shall by any
chance happen, that thy brother have committed any trespass against thee, do
not ^ynke at the fault as though thou knew it not, lest ye leattyng it to
escape unspoken of, may be to the other an occasion of more boldenes eftsons
to do the like: but play thou the faithful phisician, that is to say, show
thou him his disease with a light chydyng in secret, to the end he may be
reformed with being ashamed of that he has done. He will sooner hear a
frendely man that shall tell him of his fault, then a troubleous or brablyng
accuser whom he must repute and take for an open enemy. For such is the
nature of man, for the most part, that he will with a better will set
himself in a staigh and quiette by good advise and counsel, then he will
yield to be over trodden with wrong. It cannot but appear to be a great poyncte
of ientilnesse, when one secrtely tells a body of his fault. But he that
openly detecteth a man, and requires to have him punished, semethe not to
be of any such mind, or will, to cure his brothers sore, but rather to
notify and publishe the same to his dishonestee and open confusion.

That in case thy brother being told of his fault by the, shall emende and
acknowelage his offense: leat forgiveness be ready, which may familiarly
and louinglye receive him again, And if he repent forgive him.
as soon as he is reformed: and so far be thou from ons thinkyng how to
redress it by auengemente, that thou save the parties honestee also, as much
as in thy power lies. That if the same party through humain frailty shall
eftsoon be fallen in relapse of the same or an other such like offense: yea
although he trespace against the seven times in a day, and than do seven
times in a day repent again, and earnestelye appliyng himself to pacifye
thee, shall say: I have done amysse, I am sorye for it, forgive me: forgive
thou him the fault from the botome of thy heart. This ientilnesse of forgeuyng
and releasyng one an others offenses and trespaces, shall after a much better
sort maintain peace and concord among you, then mutual requiting of one
shrewde turn or displeasure for an other.

The Apostles, because they well perceived by these sayings of Jesus, that
faith is the fountain of all evangelical virtues, which faith the Lord did
so diligentely require in them as a thing necessary if they should be hable
to work miracles, which faith he did so many times allow and commend, yea
even in many alienes too that were not borne in Iewry, which faith could
obtain any manier thing what ever it were, and through which faith even
their own selfs also had put away soondry diseases from men, and had
cast out deiuils: and because they knew and remembered well, yt only through
defaulte and want of faith in them, it had hapened, that they could not
deliver a certain person before, being possessed with a dumme deiuill. Albeit
one shall not be a fit man for the other necessary precepts of the gospel
neither, unless he have conceived an undoubted faith and trust in his heart.
For when will he despise the sensual pleasures of this world, when will he
pour out his gooddes to bestow them on the poor, when will he releasse and
clerelye forgive a displeasure or a wrong dooen unto him by his brother, when
will he do such persons good, as have dooen him the contrary, when will he
mekely and pacientelye take enpriesonmente, scourgeyng with rods, and the
peines of death: which is not fully and thoroughly persuaded, that he has an
inestimable large reward prepared for him in heaven? This thing (I say)
because the Apostles well understood, Lord increase our faith.
they say unto the lord: Master, forasmuch as we have no goodness at all
but of thee, we pray thee that thou will encreace our faith in us. The Lord
hereupon, as one that well knew the Apostles to be as yet gross and
vnperfeicte, and to make request to have their faith encreace chiefly for such
a purpose, that they might have the more power to show miracles: dooethe in
deed allow and ratifye the strength and power of faith, if it be sincere and
pure in a body as it ought to be: but he opened unto them, that the same
ought to be coupled with humility and sobrenesse of the most perfeicte
degree, and that it ought not to be showed forth for vainglorious bostyng,
but at such times always as either the preseruacion of the neighbor, orels
the glory of God does at the point of some extremity necessarily require
it. And hereupon says he by a similitude or comparison: If ye have faith as a
grain or corn of mustarsede, which is litell in quantye, and low by the
ground, ne puts not forth his virtue of bityng the toungue except it be
bruised in some thing or broken between the teeth, If ye had faith like a grain
of mustardesede.
ye shall say to this Sycamine tree, which by reason that the roots are
taken of a great wide coumpace within ye ground, seems impossible by any
strength or power to be plucked up out of his place, be thou plucked up by the
root, and be thou removed into the sea, there to stand as fast rooted as
thou stand here now, and it shall obey your bidding. Tertes by the grain of
mustardsede, ye Lord signified himself, who whereas he showed and used
himself the most lowest and meanness of al creatures, yet did he hyde within
him a secret power of the nature of the godhed, which tha^ and never before
vttred it self, when the grain of his body was bruised on the cross: and
was in death (as it were) burried within the ground. The effectual strength
of this grain wrought in the disciples, whereof they ought not to have
usurped any portion to their owneselfes, as the which were not the principal
autours ne head dooers of the things that they wroughte, but only ministers
and servants, assured to be punished if they had lingered or slacked to go
through with executyng that was given them in charge and commission to do:
and bound to put over all the land and praise unto god, if any thing had or
should by mean of them be iolyly or royally well done.

This good lesson before going the lord did by addyng thereunto an other
parable, engraue in the hertes of his disciples. Which of you (said he) is a
master so much for a servants ease or commodity to dwell withal, that in
case he have a servant that is a tiller of his ground, or his heard to keep
his cattall, will say to him by and by as soon as he is come home from his
weorke out of the field: Geat thee yonder, and go sit the down to meat:
and well not rather thus speak: Which of you if he had a servant
ploughing? etc.
come on, make ready somewhat for me to have to my supper: and girde thy
clothes to thee, and come and awaite upon me until I shall have taken my
repaste of meat and drink, and than shalt thou take thee some meat and
drink afterward? And yet this notwithstanding that the said servant did
uprightly and faithfully that his duetye was to do in the field, does his
master use to give him thanks because he has dooen all that was given him in
commandment to be dooen? I think not: but he would have punished him well
and truly in case he had not dooen it. And why so? Does he thank y^
servant because he did the things? etc.
veraily for none other respect or consideracion, but because they are
servants, and even of duetye oughe all their service to their master, to
whom theimselfes and all are due as to the true owener. And as for the thank
and praise of all that ever is dooen, the master takes to himself, who is
accoumpted for the dooer of ye things, whatsoever he does by mean of them,
who without him can utterly do no manier good thing at all. And in like
manier even ye too, take not unto your selfs the glory of your well
doings: but only do ye your faithful labor as your duty is. And when ye
shall have dooen all things, which been enjoined or commanded you, yet say
ye: Unprofitable servants we are, what our duetye was to do, we have dooen,
We are unprofitable servants
and no more. For this humility shall conserve and keep the Jewel of feyth
perfect in you. All the rest of things leave ye unto your Lord. Leat none of
you take into his own hands as due unto him, any honor, ne prevent he not
the judgment of the Lord. He best knows his own time: and he will defraude
no man of his reward. Ye in the mean while remember your selfs to be none
other but servants, oughyng all your work and labor of a bounden duty.

And so it befell that as the Lord was going toward Jerusalem, he made his
way lie through the countries of Samaria and Galilee. For he had oftentimes
a fansy, wha^ he might have any occasion, to take Samaria and Galile in his
way, yt he might enbraide the inhabitauntes of Jerusalem with their
hardenesse of beleuyng, whereas they abhorred the Samaritanes wurse then the
heathen, and reputed ye Galileans for more then half Paganes and miscro^au^tes.
And as he was entreing into a little village, there met him te^ne men being
lepres every one of them. Ye may well think yt by these lepres are signified
heretical persons, being within forth altogether defourmed and corrupted
with eiuil affeccions, the skin withoutfoorth spotted and speckled, (as by
this rese^blaunce to understand,) that in heretical persons vnpure doctrine
altogether entremedleth false things with the true. An infectiue kind of
people and sore to be abhorred: and therefore be they straightly kept from
coumpaigniyng among men: yet no kind of sore there is, which Jesus does not
heal, so that the diseased come in his sight, and so that the disease be
vttred unto him, and perfect affiaunce rest in the parties.

These lepres agnised and knowlaged their disease, and therefore they approach
not nere to the person of Jesus, Go* show your selfs unto the priests. etc.
but standing a far of, they lift up their voice on high, and cry aloud
unto the Lord. O Jesus our master have thou mercy and piety upon us. Jesus
heard their cry (which was a good witness of their affiaunce in him) and
turned his iyes toward them. Blissed is such a criyng, as makes the Lord
earneste to give ear: and blissed is that castyng of the iye on them, which
moves him to show mercy. But none other answer made Jesus unto them,
saving that they should go their ways, And one of them. etc. turned back.
and show theimselfes to the priests. For in the priests rested the
authority to discern the lepre from a clean manne. They do as he bids
them, and depart their ways replenished with faith and assured trust in god
for their health. And even in their going they were made all clean. They had
every one of them eguall faith and affyaunce, but they had not every one
eguall thankfulness of heart for the benefit received. The Samarytane only
and no mo of them, when he perceived and felt himself plainly in very deed
delivered from his disease, he made no counsel of the beneficial goodness of
God toward him, but returned immediately unto Jesus, gloryfiyng god with a
loud voice: and falling down prostrate on his face, he laid himself at the
fete of Jesus, wurshippyng him, and geuyng him thanks. But Jesus knowing well
enough, that the benefit of health had come unto all the ten, but myndyng
to check the unthankfulness of them, who did as much as they could in their
mind by priuye stealth to enjoy so great a benefit, said: were there not
ten lepres made whole, and nine of them where are they become? For the Lord
knows none unthankful people, and shows such ones to be unworthy a
benefit received, as do not give thanks to him that has dooen them good.
For god cannot abide to have his benefits kept secret in hugger mugger. When
the Samaritane kept ^ilence being a man not only thankful, but also full of
humility and sobrenesse, as one y^ was come thither to do his own duetye,
and not to accuse any others: Jesus turnyng to the coumpaignie which stood
round about, There are not found that returned.
said: of all the ten has there not one been found, that would return
back again, and glorify God, but this one straungier being a foremer borne in
an other countreye. But it had more become the others thus to do, who because
they be Jews, haunte theimselfes to be true seruers and wurshippers of God.
And yet in the very thing self this Samaritane passes their devout
holiness. And wha^ the Lord had thus much said, Thy faith has made the
whole.
he spoke to the Samaritane liyng prostrate on the ground. Arise up (said he)
and go thy ways, assured that this my benefit shall continue with thee for
ever, which benefit thy faithful affiaunce in me has purchased and obtained
unto thee.

Now for because Jesus had the kingdom of god oftentimes in his mouth, the
Phariseis, (who did not yet understand the kingdom evangelical to be a
ghostelye kingdom, but dreamed that it was some other kingdom, wh^rein the
nation of the Jews should have dominion over other nations,) came unto him,
The kingdom of god shall not co^^ with waytyng.
and demanded wha^ the kingdom of god should come. But Jesus, who at all
times when any mention was made of the last day, used even of a custom to
answer doubtefully, said: The kingdom of God will not come after the manier
of a worldly kingdom, in sort that either the time thereof, or the place may
be watched for and espied. For it is not a kingdom of the bodies but of the
souls, neither does it stand by visible mayntenaunce, but invisible.
Therefore it shall not be said unto you: lo here, or lo there. For what
needs it to awaite for any place, seeing the kingdom of God is within you? why
do ye look without forth, for the thing which ye have within you, and is
carried about with you whereuer ye go, if ye be so disposed your selfs?
Why do ye look for the thing, as though it were yet hereafter to come,
which is already present? Wheresoever is a mind or heart being master over
riches, sensual pleasures, dignity and promocions of this world, yea and
finally a contemner of death: whersoeuer is a mind strong and stout in feith,
burning in charity, enspired with the holy ghost: in thatsame place is ye
kingdom of God. There is now no more to do, but that ye embrace the thing
which is present, lest when that same day shall suddenly come, which shall make
perfect and shall show this kingdom, it find you vnreadye.

see there. Go not after them nor follow them. For as the lightening that
appears out of the one part that is under heaven, and shines unto the other
part, which is under heaven: so shall the son of man be in his days: but
first must be suffer many things and be refused of this nation. And where
the disciples neither, did not well understand this, who on their parts also
dreamed that the yearthlye kingdom of Israel should be greatly enlarged:
Jesus turnyng unto them, did so tempre his words, as he might make them to be
always ready against the last day of judgment, and yet take away from them,
the careful searchyng of the time when it should be, and might rather arm
the^ to the tempeste of the cross even than already very nere approchyng. The
time (says he) undoubtedly shall come, when ye shall desire to have the
fruicion of the sight of the son of man but even so much as for one days
space, (whereas now that he is present, many an one do set naught by him:)
and yet ye shall not have your wish n^ desire: And yet shall there not want
some persons, who flatreyng the earnest fainesse of men, shall attempt and
make somewhat a do to show him as though he were present, And they shall
say to you se here.
saying: lo, here, lo, there: but give ye no credit to such manier
prophets. If they shall say: Here he is amongst us, go not ye: if they shall
say: lo yonder he is a far hens, gooe ye not thither to follow them. Leate
your belief be to credit such things, as ye see to have been told and spoken
before by the holy prophets, and to be now at this present fulfilled. This
only one thing it was not gods pleasure, that is should be made open to the
world, and therefore it pleased him not, that the time thereof should be
known aforehand, because it is so most expediente for the health and
salvation of all men, whom his will and mind is, that they be in a readiness
against all times and hours. Therefore like as lightenyng soodainlye flashyng
forth, does show his fiery brightenesse from one side of the aier as
far as the other side against it, before ye have any perceiueraunce that any
such thing is to come: so shall the cummyng of the soonne of man be, (certes
with no small glory, but yet unlooked for) at such a day as himself and no mo
knows, and will in any wise have the same to you unknown. But his majesty he
shall not show forth, before that he shall have thoroughly fulfilled the
dispensacion of his lowenesse and humilitee. For the way to the brightenesse
of the kingdom of God, But first must he suffer many things.
must first be showed: and the door of the kingdom of heaven must first be
opened, that men may enter in. Otherwise to a very small benefit or
commodity should the kingdom of God come, for such persons parts, as have
not prepared themselfes to the same. Than ere the maiest^e shall show it self,
which ye do affeccionately desire before the due time, the soonne of man
must suffer many things, and must be condemned of this nation: to the end
that as in a fire first mounteth ye smoke, and than afterward shoots up the
flame: so may the glory of god more clearly show forth it self, after the
open shame and reproach of this world.

But that the said day may not take a man tardie, the remedy and provision is
easy, if every one so prepaire himself to be in a readiness, as though
the same day were even now every momente cumming at hand. And it happened in
the days of Noe.
But men being wedded unto the world, will promysse and waraunt themselfes of
a longer day ere it come, yea or that such a day will never come at all, and
being careless by reason of such hope, Gene. viii. v. Mat. xxiiii.
they will idly give themselfes to their own lusts and appetites. Therefore
the same chance shall come in the days of the soonne of man, which happened in
the days of Noe. They took wives and they gave out their daughters to marriage,
as though the floudde, which was differred for a time, would not have come at
al. But the evil misaue^ture came soodainlye upon them and took them tardy.
Only Noe with a few mo was saved by mean of the Arc. The residue perished
every one of them. And eue^ a much like light also there was to be s^one in
the time of Lot: for because there was some delay made of gods vengeance,
Likewise also as it chanced in the days of Lot. Gene..xix.^.
they conceived an opinion, that it should be unpunished, whatsoever sin they
committed. And thereupon being void of al care, they eat and drank, they
bought and sold, they planted and set trees, they made buildinges. But the
stroke and vengeance of god lighted soodainly upon them also, when they were
al void of care, and thought nothing upon it. For the self same day, when
Lot forsook the city of Sodom, and departed his way thens, it rained down
fire and brimstone from heaven, and suddenly destruied them al. And even the
very same thing to see to, shall there be in the world, when the son of man
shall soodainly show forth his maiestee. Whansoeuer that day shall grow and
come fast upon the world, leat al care of worldly things be shaken of. Leat
every man in the present peril, no more but look for saving himse^fe to
escape as he may. Therefore who^soeuer thatsame day shall find in ye house
top, At that day he that is on the house top. etc.
al his gooddes leaft beneath in his house, leate him not go down to take away
with him such gooddes as he has there: but leat him only think upon saving
of himself. Semblably if ye said day shall by chance suddenly find any man
abroad in the field, leat him not flee home to escape it: for ye peril shall
come over fast upon him, to leat him have any time of laisure at all. Every
body as he shall be found, even so leate him with renning away as fast as he
can, save his life. Call ye to remembrance what chanced unto Lottes wife.
Remember Lottes wife.
She did no more but turn her to look back, and perished immediately, so ill
does the swift stroke of the said eiuil suffer any more delay or tariaunce
at all. Such an one what ever he be, shall be the more safe from the peril, as
shall be lighter burdened then an other to flee.

And at that hour or day, to go seek or provide such things, wherewith we
commonly use to set a sure staigh for our life to come, as (for exaumple,)
apparel, money, dwelling places or such other things, shall be none other, but
casting away and lesing of the life. But such an one as castyng away from him
al pestreaunce and heavy carriage, shall not regard the helps and staighes of
this present life, but shall leat the^ go: such on one shall be sure to win
life. For at that day there shall be no laisure n^ space to think of the life of
ye body, when the life of the soul shall turn in the wh^le of being in
hassarde and ieoperdy. In ye night there shall be two in one bed etc
Neither gooddes, ne place, ne this or that kind of living, shall in that
peril save any man: but a mind that is ready to depart a way hens. For of
two persons being as nere together as is possible, suddenly shall the one be
taken to life, and the other shall be leaft behind to damnacio^. Thus much I tell
you to abide upon. That night in which the son of man shall come, there shall
be two persons liyng in one bed, and them two shall the diuersitte of
reward soodainly part in sondre. For the one shall be taken up to everlasting
bliss, and the other shall be leafte behynd to endless damnacion. There
shallbee two persons gryndyng in one mill: of which the one shall be
taken, and the other leafte behynd. Two persons shall be at their housebandrie
laboring in the fields: one of them shall be taken up, the other shall be
leaft. When ye disciples heard all this as it had been half in a dreme, not
understanding what it mente, they say unto Jesus: where master? They were
still in a dream of the fleashe, and seek to know the place of this kingdom.
Than Jesus myndyng under a derke covert to signify unto them, yt the holy
people, wheresoever they shall be found, shall not be disseuered from the
Lord, answered: wheresoever there shall be caryan, thither will the Eagles also
draw and gather together. It forces not in what place ye be, so that ye be
with me, which am the feder of your souls, and do feed them with mine own
self, who am the food of endless felicity.

The.xviii Chapter.

ANd forasmuch as the last end of the world, being at hand, there shall
arise most grievous persecucio^s against the godly, in somuche that if it may
possibly be wrought, even the very elect and chosen persons shall be seduced,
(albeit in very deed the infaciable perverseness of the eiuil does never at any
time succeasse to be cruel and full of tira^ny against the good:) the Lord
Jesus teaches his disciples and servants, that in all their aduersitees they
shall from none other place ask help or succor, That me^ ought alwaie to
pray etc.
but at the hands of God: neither going about any auengemente in the mean
while, nor defendyng one displeasure received, with dooyng an other for it.
That if God do not at the first hour deliver them from affliccion: yet must
they not therefore surceasse from praiyng. For he will undoubtedly hear the
prayers of his servants, when oportunitee of time shall be, and the delaiyng
thereof shall turn to the benefit of the Godly: yea* and so much the more
grievously shall the ungodly be oppressed, as they had persuaded theimselfes,
that whatsoever they did therein, they should do it, and no man to say black
their iye. This lesson did the Lord Jesus with such a parable as here ensues
enprinte in the hertes of his disciples and servants. There was (says he)
in a certain city, a certain judge or governor, being both a wieked man,
and also void of al shame and honestee, as one that neither stood in any fear
of God, ne had any reverence toward any mortal man. His wickedness made him
in case that he feared not God: and his great power brought him to the poyncte
that he would show no reverence to manne. And so it was, that in the same
city there was a certain wedowe, who being sore oppressed of her adversary,
went unto the said high judge, in whose hands rested the highest power, There
was in a certain city a judge which feared not God. etc.
and she prayed him of his help and aid against the violent oppressyon of her
aduersarye. Sir (says she) my matter is very good and true, and yet am I
ouertroden through the richesse and frendshyp that mine adversary has in
your court. I am a poor wedowe and alone woman destitute of fre^des. I pray
you see a redress in the cause of my right against ye violence of mine
adversary. Where he was oftentimes thus spoken to by the wedowe, yet
nevertheless a long time he would not be acknowen of the matter, nor would
not help the wedowe, whereas such great power is given to certain men even
for such a purpose only, that they should be helpers and succourers of
orphans, of wards being in nonage, of wedowes, and of poor folks, against
the rich men and mainteners of brableyng matters. At the last when she would
make none end of criyng upon him, the judge begoonne thus to think within
himself. Although I neither stand in fear of God, ne bear any reverence to
any man alive, yet because this wedowe is importune upon me with her
vnsaciablenesse in that she will not be answered, I will help to rid her from
the oppression of her adversary, not for any good mind that I bear her, but
lest she will else at length come again, and being so many times shaken of,
will with her raillyng set a great blurre on mine honestee and good name, in
that I occupiyng the room of the chief justice and judge in this city, have
yet nevertheless wilfullye and stiffely leate a wedowe be without help or
redress, when she was wrongfullye ouertroden. When Jesus had thus told out
all this parable, And shall not God avenge his elect?
he said by and by after it: Do ye hear what this judge says, being both
an ungodly man, and an il disposed? Being ouercomed with the importunity of
praiyng and entreatyng, he help the wedowe: and God who is most just, and
merciful toward his elected being called upon with nightly and also daily
prayers and criynges, will he weaxe deaffer and deaffer, and not deliver his
servants from the violence of such as oppress them, but will with a slow
and a pacient mind suffer them to be oppressed with affliccions and never
see any auengemente ne redress thereof? Nay, this I say unto you to be bold
on: he will not suffer it to be so: but either he will convert their hertes,
in sort that their will being changed, they shall cease to do you any more
affliccion, or else he will take away from them habylitie and power to do
harm, or else such as be his elected, he will for altogether quickly deliver
from all eiuil, and remove them to a place of rest everlasting. I wys when that
same last day of judgment shall be ons come, now shall neither Satan, nor
his weorking tools the ill men, be of power any thing to do against those,
whom God has specially chosen aside to be partakers of his kingdom. For when
the wickdenesse of the eiuill sort shall be weaxen so high, Nevertheless
when the son of man comes.
that it can grow no higher: than shall the son of man, suddenly come: and
in verai deed sooner shall he come, than the eiuill men thinks for. But at
the time when the son of man shall come, shall he (trow ye) ^ynd feith
upon the earth? For as well the multitude as also the perverseness of eiuill
persons shall be so great, that feith shall remain perfeict and whole but
with a few. Yet not withstanding with whomesoeuer thatsame constaunt feyth and
trust in God shall be found, the same persons shall be delivered, God being the
auenger of their cause.

So with the parable before going he put such people in a fear, as being
openly wieked, were daily scourges unto the godly. But there was a
pharisaicall sort of ryghteous men, puttyng their trust in their own weorkes,
and presumpteously taking unto themselfes the land and title of righteousness
by the same weorkes, whereas no creature is just before God: and such did not
only stand in their own conceiptes like fools, but also in comparison of
them selfs despised others, as sinners, whereas the humility of the others
is more acceptable before God, then the works of any such. The Lord Jesus
as well against persons of such pharisaicall righteousness, as also to the
coumforte of sinners from the botome of their hertes mislikyng themselfes,
put forth such a parable as here ensues.

So it befell that two certain persons went up into the temple for to pray,
of which persons the one was a Pharisee, and the other a Publicane. The
Pharisee sta^dyng nigh to the propiciatorie or mercy seat, Two men went up
into the temple to pray.
as if ye should say in English, the high altar, like one that was woorthye
to talk with God eue^ at his very elbowe, prayed in this sort within
himself. I thank the o God, for that I am not like unto other men, which
live by robbyng and stealyng, which increase their substance by fraud and
guyle, which pollute other married men's beds with aduoutrye, or finallye,
which bearyng offices of infamye and slaundre, do piele the people of God
for their princes pleasure of which sort this publicane here is one. I do
not give my self to excessive eating and drinking, as the most part of people
do, but I fast twyse in the Sabbath, that is to say, twyse every weke, and
so far am I from defrauding of any body, that I give continually the tenth
part of al my goods in alms to the poor. This was the manier of praiyn^ of
this the swellyng proud pharisee, who although he recited things th^^ were
true, and gave thanks to God: yet even in this verai point he displease^ the
iyes of god, that he liked himself well, plaiyng the flaterer toward himself,
and full of despitefull words against the neighbor. The Publicane
contrariewise altogether mislikyng himself, because his conscience yelde^ him
gyltie of many sins, stood a far of from the holy things, so much ashamed
and repentaunt in himself, that he durst no^ so much as lift up his iyes to
heaven: but he knocked his breast, saying: O God be thou merciful unto me a
sinner. The pharis^y did no more but give thanks, as one yt thought himself
to want nothing unto perfect godliness: neither does he confess any
offenses, whereas eue^ in this very praiyng he did most grieuouslye sin,
making vauntes of his own doings, and despising one that was penitent, a
proud presumptuous prayser of himself, and a rash accuser of the neighbor.
The Publicane on the other part makes no rehersall ne mencyon at all of his
well doings. He only acknowelagyng his eiuils, knocks his breast, that
knew what state it stood in, and lamentably calls for the lords mercy. I
say unto you: this man departed justified more tha^ the other.
Will ye know the end of these contrary manners of praiyng? The said
Publicane who had cum a sinner into the temple, went his way home more
righteous in the sight of God, then that same Pharisee who thought himself a
man of most perfect justice. For whosoever magnifyeth himself in his own
mind, shall be cast down in the syghte of god. And whosoever casts himself down
in his own heart, shall be exalted on high in the sight of God.

And behold, an other occasion, whereby for the Lord to commend unto us
humility and softenes, coupled with simplicity and plainness. Mothers
brought their young babes unto Jesus, to the entente he should touch them and
bliss them: thinkyng that it should come to pass that the same children
should by that means be in the more safety from such chances and diseases
as that age is commonly wont to be in daungier of. The dyscyples, when they
saw the thing, rebuked the women, because they did with such tryftyng matters
trouble the lord, having otherwise (as they thought) his hands full enough of
bussinesse already. But Jesus, although he knew al thissame to be dooen by
his said disciples of a certain good diligence, declaring their readiness, to
do their duty toward him, yet to express unto us an exaumple of
simplicity, of humility, and of innocence, and al under one to give ^ lesson
unto pastors, that they ought not to despise any body, be he never so mean or
so weak, But Jesus said: Suffer the children to cum unto me.
he called his disciples together unto him, and said: Suffer ye the children
to cum unto me, nor be not against it, that they may be brought unto me, for
unto such belongs the kingdom of god. Leat an exaumple be showed forth unto
all creatures, that they may understand to what degree of perfeccion they
ought to grow. These little ones know no fashions of clokyng ne counterfaityng,
they are not acquaynted with pride ne haultnesse of ^ooke, they know not the
way to strike again when they are steiken, they can no skill to give reuiling
words again, Whosoever receives not the. etc.
they know not what avarice means, they can no skill of ambicio^, it is mere
innocency that is in them, it is mere simplicity without any fraud or guile.
This word I say unto you to trust unto: the kingdom of God receives none,
but such as be reforged and changed according to this pattern. Therefore
unless a man cum to the doctrine of the gospel with the like simplicity that
these children are of, he shall not enter into the kingdom of God.

Good master what ought I to do?
Than again came there unto Jesus one of the great states and the heademen, as
one that should be even in very fact a plain declaracion, what it meant that
Jesus had said concerning the state of children: And thus said the great man:
Good master what may I do to atteyne everlasting life? Than Jesus willing
to notify that this surname, good, serves to none, but to god only, who of
his very propre nature is good, answered him thus: Why dooest thou call me
good? why call thou me good? etc.
None is good, saving god only: not for that the lord does not acknowlage
the surname of good, as due unto him, as touching that he was God: but because
the said rich man attributed the word good unto Jesus, as being a man, yea
and would peradventure have taken it to himself too, if any such occasion had
cum in place: He therefore did not after a right sort call Jesus good, whom he
did not yet believe to be god. And for this cause did the lord at that time
refuse the honor of this title, because he well vnderst^de the demaunder of the
question not to be utterly void of swellyng pride, as one that thought himself
to abound in many good works. And Jesus because he would show forth the
man's sore, said: Thou know the co^maundeme^ntes.
Thou know the precepts of Moses law, that is to wete: Thou shall not
kill: thou shall not commit aduoutrye: Thou shall not do theft: Thou shall
not bear false witness: Honor thy father and thy mother. To these words
said the other, as one myndyng to bear a way a praise and commendacion of
perfect righteousness: Al these points every one of them, have I duly kept
even from the beginning of my youth.

This saying was not far from that saying of the Pharisee above specified:
but it was a great deal short of the symplicitie of the young children la^t
before declared. One fault therefore there was opened hereby, but there was an
other privy fault hidden besides also, which made him unapt for the
kingdom of God. Jesus therefore because he would discover ye other fault too,
said. Thou lackest one point yet. That if thou wylt enter the kingdom of the
gospel, Sell all that thou have.
go thy ways, sell all that ever thou have in thy possession, and by
distributyng it abroad in alms to the poor, lay up a treasure for thy self
in heaven. That dooen, being free, and rydde from all let and vncoumbraunce,
come than, and follow me. The said demaunder when he had heard these words,
was stricken with great sorrow, for he was exceeding rich. He was sorye, for he
was veraie rich.
He was not yet reduced nor brought to the pattern of a young child,
forasmuch as the love of richesse had possessed his heart. Than Jesus seeing
him to depart an heavy man, who did in such sort sue for to come to ye bliss
of the kingdom of heaven, that nevertheless he could not contemn the
richesse of this world: turned to his disciples, and as one being in a great
meruail, he said: It is easier for a camel to go thorough a nedles iye. etc.
How hardely shall those which are heavy laden with the burden of richesse,
enter into the kingdom of God through the narowe gate? For an easier thing it
is for a camel to perce through the iye of a nedle, then for a rich man to
enter the kingdom of god. The disciples being with these words sore
troubled in their minds, said: If no rich man do enter thither, who than can
be saved? The things which are impossible. etc.
for one shall find but a few persons, but either they have riches or covet to
have. But he recomforted the dismaiyng of his disciples again, saying: The
thing which with men is impossible, is possible enough with god. It is not of
man's power to despise richesse, and such other commodities as follow at the
tail of richesse. But this strength and stoutness of heart does god give
unto such as through simple and unfeigned beleuyng, do show themselfes apt
for to receive his gifts. And he is with god no longer taken for worldely
rich, whosoever has laid away from him the love of money, and in such wise
possesses his money, that he will with all his heart leave the same, as often as
respect of health and salvation everlasting shall require it.

Of these words the Apostles conceive a good hope, the more part of whom had
left altogether whatsoever it was that they were owners of tofore. Therefore in
the behalf of the^ al speaks Peter, saying: lo we have left al, and have
followed thee, we have performed eue^ yesame point also, which thou did
earnestly require of the rich man. Than although it was but a very small
portion that Peter and Andrewe had left (albeeit if they had had more, more
would they have forsaken:) The Lord conneth them thank for their readiness
in that they had done, and because they should not need to repent them of that
they had dooen, shows that great gain it is, to have lost worldely richesse
for the kingdom of God. For in lieu and place of transitory and vile things
by the^ conte^ned, both here in this world the mind and soul is enryched
with goods heavenly, and also in the world to come endless felicity is
repaied for them. Than furthermore hereupon thus said the Lord. This I auouche
unto you for a matter not to be doubted of: not to you only shall it turn to
great gains in the end, to have left for my sake the little slender
possessions that ye had: but also, whatsoever person shall for the respect of
the kingdom of god forsake either house, or father, or mother, or brethren, or
wife, or children: he shall both in this present life receive much mo things
and also better then he left: and moreover in the world to cum, he shall
receive life everlasting.

After that he had with these sayings somewhat lifted up and chered the hertes
of his disciples again: he took with him the twelve apostles, who^ it was not
behoueable to be ignorant of any thing which were wrought and done for the
rede^pcion of mankind. And now begins he even su^what openly and plainly to
beat the matter into their heads concerning ye death which he should at
Jerusalem wittingly and willingly dye, according to the foresayinges of the
prophets. For he knew very well that they should be very sore dismayed and
discu^forted with the death of their master, and for that consideracio^ he
do^th often beat this tale into their heads, to the end that at the last it
may be engraven in their hertes, and that by a little and a little, they might
be enured to abide the matter, which as yet their ears abhorred to hear
me^cioned or spoken of. And verily this was none unbelief in them, but a
certain earnest love strongly working in the^ toward their master. Severally
therefore from the cumpany, he begoonne to open unto them, that the time of his
death did now approach. Behold (says he) we are now going up toward
Jerusalem, and there shall all things be accomplished that have been written by
the prophets concerning the son of man. For he must be delivered into the
hands of the Gentiles, and of them shall he be scorned and scourged, and
spetted on. And after that they shall have scourged him, and shall have
mynistred unto him all kinds of reproach and vilanie in words, they shall in
fine put him to death: but he shall arise again the third day from death to
life. But this talk, because it was nothing sweet ne pleasant, could in no
wise sink in to the Apostles stomakes: (as commonly we are hard of belefe in
such matters as we would not with our good wills have to be true.) And they
could in no wise perceive the mystery of the cross, wherhence rede^pcio^ and
salvation should by a new found conueighaunce of god, cum forth and issue unto
the world. They had no lust ne fansy to believe that a man whom they loved so
entierly should dye of such a violent kind of death: neither could they
possibly believe it likely, that such an one should be put to death by the
hands of the wicked, as was hable to do such wonderful acts, and which had
so many times escaped out of the hands of such as had attempted to assail
him and fasten upon him: and finally they doubted not, but that it might be
afterward an easier thing for him to bring to pass, not to dye at al, tha^ to
revive again from death, as he said he would, yea and they thought it better
not to dye at all, then after death to be restored to life again.

And although they could not doubt of their masters truth in his words:
yet did they in this manner flatter their own affeccions: and they enterpreted
that in these words of Jesus there lay privily hidden some figurate and
mistical manner of speaking, such as the lord did of a special property that
was in him very much and often use to bring in, begilyng by means of that
same colorable speaki^g, not only the people, but also the very apostles
selves: as (for exau^ple) wha^ he willed the^ to beware from ye leaue^ of ye
phariseis: wha^ he au^swered that he had an other kind of meat which he
hou^gred for: wha^ he taught the^ for a lesson, that a camel might sooner pass
through a nedles iye, then a rich man enter into the kingdom of heaven: when
(signifiyng that his doctrine must be received and conveyed thoroughly into the
very bowels of the soul,) he said that no man should have life in time to
come, unless the same should first eat his flesh, and drink his blood: And
finally wha^ he promised that himself would within three days space reedifie
the temple, after it were destroyed by the Jews: with such suspicions and
conjectures as these, did the Apostles flattre their affeccion, and in deed
heard the words of Jesus, but they heard them as it had been half in their
sleep, but as for the pith and effectual meaning of the words, they did
vttrely not understand. And this was done as the state of the time than
required, by the Lords permission and sufferaunce, to thend, partly that they
might by a little at once better and better be enured to the thing, which
should afterward be incomparably bitter unto them, and partly because they
should not before the time scattre themselves abroad by fleyng from their
master, by whose communicacion they were yet in many matiers to be schooled.
They could not yet throughlye see ne perceive the priuities of Gods workyng
and conueighaunce, because they had the iyes of their mind in manier sterke
blind with much foggie derkenesse.

But yet much more were the others dymme of sight, which were of less
familiarity with the Lord. For the fountain of health is the knowing of
Jesus. For to know him, is to have perfect sight. Feith is bright light, the
earthly desires and lusts of this world are darkness. And behold a casual
chance, which may lay plain before your iyes, how we may see Jesus: and in
one blind man is set forth an exaumple, how the blindness of the soul may
be taken away from many. There sat one in his way, a man deprived of the
sight of his bodily iyes. But (Lord) how many were here following the train
of Jesus, which saw a great deal wurse in their souls, when even the verai
twelve Apostles had their iyes yet still ouergon with the derke slyme of
ignorance, that they could not understand the Lords manifest sayings. Than
so it befell, that when Jesus being on his way toward Jerusalem, was now
not far from Hierico, there sat a certain blind manne by the high ways
side beggyng. This blind creature, when as well by the noise of hearing folks
speak, as also by trampleyng of feet, he perceived veraye well that a great
multitude of people passed by, demanded what the matter was (as in deed such
kind of people are so much the more curious and inquisitiue of such things,
because they lack their iyes.) Answer was made unto him, that Jesus of
Nazareth was passing by thatsame way.

The party immediately having conceived in his heart a feythful trust by
reason of such things as he had heard of Jesus: He cries saying: Jesus thou
son of David, have mercy upon me.
cried out aloude, saying: Thou Jesus the son of David, have pity and
compassion upon me. Unto his importunity he added also sweet words of
flatterye, and that was even metely well according to the facion and guyse of
beggars. But the company that went before Jesus, rebuked him, and bid him to
hold his peace, suspectyng that he would have craved an alms of the common
rate, and also fearyng lest being a slouenly fellow and unsightly in his
gear, and a common beggar by the high ways side, he should have been somewhat
noyfull or troublesome unto the Lord.

But the blind manne the more that the people clattered against him, so much
the more earnestly did he cry, repeatyng still the same words which he had
spoken before: Thou Jesus, son of David, have mercy upon me. Because he could
not see Jesus, he did so much the more streygne his voice, as a man being
ignorant how far Jesus whom he called unto, was from him. Than Jesus who had
made as though he heard him not, though he had cried out with a loud voice
once or twyse or thryse before, of purpose to make the faithful trust of the
party the more evident to all the cumpanye, at the last stayghed on his way,
and commanded the blind man to be brought unto him, of purpose to occasion
the iyes of all the whole cumpanye to the diligente beholding of the miracle.

And when he was come to Jesus, the lord asked this question of him: what is
thy will that I should do unto thee? What will thou that I do unto thee?
It was not ignoraunte to him what thing the blind man wished to have: but he
would have the confession of the evil uttered in words, to the end the
miracle might be the more evident. For some are wont to feign a blyndnesse in
themselves, that they may thereby receive the larger alms: yea, and some
there were peradventure in the company, which if they had been in the blind
man's case, would not have been bold to hope for any ferther thing, then some
alms or reward in money. For the Lord also, though after the estimacion of
the world, he was but poor, yet did he use to give unto the poor, some
portion of such things as were given him by his friends for his sustentacion.
But the blind man with a great affiaunce and faith, said: lord make thou,
that I may have my sight again.

In these words did he crave the thing, which by any that was no more but a
mere man, could not be assured unto him, castyng no doubts but that Jesus
forth with, both could do it, as one most mightiest, and also would, as one
most merciful. Jesus therefore making a like quick answer to this quick
and ready faith, restored him his iyes with a word again, saying: receive thou
thy sight again. Thy faith has saved thee. He had seen Christ with his faith
ere he saw him with the iyes of his body. The faith has saved thee.
This faith verily is that thing which obteyneth all without excepcion of the
most merciful lord: this faith it is which in the thickest derkenesse of
sin, yet calls a far of to Jesus, that he may show mercy. The
conscience and privy knowelage of his naughty synnefull acts paste, does
iangle against him when he cries: but feruentnesse of faith does so much the
more eagrely streygne the voice. Such manner beggars does the Lord Jesus love:
and for none other consideracion does he many times make delay of that that
is asked, saving that the pa^tie which is the beggar may be worthy to have
the more benefit. And in most diepe derkenesse do such people lie, which
wurship stocks and stones instead of God: to whom their money, to whom
their bealye is their god: who are bondeseruauntes to ambicion, to leacherie,
and such as set the world in an vproare through furious rageyng wars. Such
persons if they cannot yet come, to approach nere unto Jesus, because they
cannot see: yet at lestewise at the noise of such as do throughoute the whole
world preach the glory of Jesus, leat them ask: what matier is this? And
when they shall know that Jesus is passing by, leat them not suffer the
present occasion to slip away, but leat them with pieteous criyng weary his
ears: And in case the privy conscience of their naughty and eiuil deeds before
past, counsel the^ to keep silence: leat the clamoure of the faithful
beleuyng heart so much the more instauntly knock at the doors of his ears.
Jesus is not deaf ne hard of hearing to any body that asks with faithful
trust in hi^: and he is of power hable to give that is asked. He ce^ies passes
by, but he will not go very far paste, if one strain his voice. And happy is
ye beggar that ever he was born, at whose voice Jesus stays on his way. And
what meruaill, if he stayed at the voice of one speaking unto him, sense he
vouchsalued to cu^ so far a journey, unto a sheep that was lost? But more
happy is the blind man, after he is brought unto Jesus. For now is he very nere
to his health. Neither ca^ he long be blind, whosoever has approached to ye
fountain of al light. Thatsame lord being the fountain of all glory does not
put away the beggar from him, and man being a sinner disdaineth the neighbor.
After that thou art cum in presence before Jesus, after that thou art gone away
from thy self, there is no need of any long praiyng: no more but speak the
word what thou would have, (but speak it with a perfect faith and
affiau^ce conceived not on thine own merits, but on his great power, and no
less goodness.) And immediately shall thy sight cum again and salvation both
together. For at once, as soon as Jesus had said: Look thou up, he had his
sight, and of a beggar, became a follower of Jesus train, and an open declarer
of gods goodness. Yea, and moreover the people also when they had seen so
notable a miracle, gave laud and praise unto god.

The.xix. Chapter.

ANd this same blind man to whom the Lord restored the use of the light,
does in a figure not unaptly signyfie the people of the Gentiles. For as for
the Jews, ye law gave sum piece of light unto them. But the Gentiles lay in
most diepe derknesse of ignorance, in so much, that among the same a great
many there were which verily believed, that there was no God at all, and some
others believed that there were Gods innumerable, but the same more full of
mischief and abominacion, then the very men self. Again sum thought, that God
took no care for the governance of worldly things. Yea and sum also there
were, which reputed and used the son, the moon, oxen, dogs, apes, yea and
lekes and oynio^s for Gods. Among the Gentiles there were, that knew no
laweful ne determinate bands of matrimony, but fulfilled the lust of the body
in going together one with another after the manner of bruit beasts. Sum there
were also with whom it was accounted a natural thing to have killed their
parents wha^ they were aged. Others again there were, among whom it was a
thing lawful and usual to eat man's fleashe. Sum there were with whom it was
an high point of devotion and of seruyng God, to kill their most derely
beloved children for a sacrifice to this or that devil. What ca^ there be more
lamentable then this blyndnesse? And yet this blind man being poor and
destitute of all virtues, perceived Jesus when he passed by (who^ the nation of
the Jews put away when he came to them) he streyned his voice of faith, criyng
aloude. Thou son of David have mercy upon me. He constrained Jesus to stay in
his going: he deserved to be asked what he would have done to him: he confessed
his blindness: he showed the desire of his heart: lord that I may have my
sight: he received that he plainly in few words craved. Of a wurshipper of
monstreous things he was made a wurshipper of Jesus: of a bondseruaunt to
devils and to all manner vices, he was made a disciple and a follower of Jesus:
of a common beggar and crauer of a miserable alms, he was made a publisher of
the power of god. And many a time more then once or twice are exau^ples of this
kind laid in the lappes of the Jews, to the end that either they should
amend from their unbelief, orels they should make it open and manifest for the
time to cum, There was a man named Zacheus.
that they were worthilye cast of, as me^ that would not be made whole. And this
figure certes was showed at the enterau^ce of the city of Hiericho: but an
other more evident exau^ple shows it self anon after within the city self.
For as the lord being entered into Hiericho, was going along through the mids
of the city encou^paced on every side with an exceadyng thick press of the
multitude of all sorts: there was a certain man zacheus, having his name of
the thing and property that was in him (that is to wete, a man fervent in the
earnest love and desire of righteousness) whereas in deed he was an head man
among the publicans, yea and rich withal, and whereas neither the kind or
trade of his living, ne the pa^pering of fortune, did very well agree with
such an heart. And holde^ he was with a great desire to see Jesus, to the
intent he might know him by ^ight also, of who^ the brute and fame had spread
abroad things so worthy to be maruailed at. He believed and also loved that he
had heard, and for that cause much according to the exaumple of the inward
desire of Simeo^, and of the Patriarchs, he did with an holy desirefulnes covet
to satisfy his iyes too, with the blissful and happy sight of him, as one
that would have attempted greatter things then that too, saving that
softness and humility was a let thereof, and even for that very point the
worthier to have the more fruicion of the presence and cumpany of Jesus. A
desire to have a sight of Jesus had a long time holde^ Herod too, he saw him
at last, and bid away with him in despite, for in vain does he see Jesus, who
is not seen again of Jesus. But Jesus had seen zacheus, before that zacheus
ever set iye on him. Herod would fain have seen him that he might have
delyted his curyous iyes being a king as he was, by showing of sum miracle
before him. But zacheus being desirous to see him what he should be, because he
would know what man he was, and as he was, that is to wete, thatsame only
soonne of God the author and worker of all salvation unto all creatures,
beeleuyng and trustyng in him. It is no great matter to see Jesus after the
flesh with such like iyes as the Phariseis saw him withal every day, and yet
had him in derision. But the iyes of the disciples are earnestly reported to be
blissed, who had deserved to see, Math. xiii. Luke* x.
that was to many princes of the earth denied. Simo^ the son of Jonas is by
y^ mouth of Jesus pronounced blessed, in that he saw who Jesus was, when he
gave this testimony of him: Thou art that same Christ, Math. xvi. Luke. ix.
John. vi.
the son of ye living God: but the Jews saw not who he was in that they
said: Is not this Joseph the Carpentars son? but unto the godly desire of
zacheus shamefastness was a let, that he did not break into Jesus perforce
through the cumpany, and the great multitude of people sta^dyng so thick round
about Jesus on every side, Mark, vi. Math. xiii. Luke. iiii.
was an other let. The short stature of his body was also the third let. For
he was a very low man of stature. And low men spiritually are such, as
are incumbente and do rest on filthy or vile and transitory things. For low
and basse it is, whatsoever this world has, if it be compared with the
majesty of the gospel. And of such persons cannot Jesus be seen, except they
conueigh theymselfes into some high place: Jesus being above of a great height
will not be seen but of the low. Jesus being in the mids among the low
and vulgar press of the people, is not seen, but of such as have trodden the
higheste top of al worldly things under their feet. And therefore to the
end that he might be seen of all the little low persons on every side
throughout all nations of the world, himself afterward climed up to the wood of
the cross standing aloft of a great height. Zacheus than being little and low,
not only of stature of his body, And he ran before, and clymed into a wild
figtree.
but also in humbleness of heart: to the intent he would stand aloft and see
Jesus being allow on the ground, ran before, and took up an high place in ye
way there as Jesus was to pass by. And an high standing as good as it had been
in a pulpit, he got ready for him in a wild figtree, which is there called a
Sycomore (because it brings forth figs of the own right kind that other
figtrees be of, and by reason thereof is also called a fig of Egypt, and yet
in leaf it resembles the mulbery tree.) A great press of the Jews environed
Jesus round about on every side. The law had gone before, the prophets also had
gone before, and that present age did both on the one side and the other close
him in round about. Yea and yet at this day the nacio^ of the Jews do come
behind after him: they learn what things Jesus did, and what things he
taught: and yet can they not see who thatsame is of whom and by whom they ought
to hope for salvation. Zacheus renning before, preue^teth this felicity,
bearing verily a figure of ye gentiles. What is the cause thereof? forsooth
because the Jew remains yet still allow on the ground, and cleueth to the
carnalitie of the law. And Jesus is not seen, but only of such as from the
low and basse lettre of the law do auau^ce up themselves to ye loftier sense
of the spirit. Down out of this high standing one may well see Jesus, who he
is, and where he is. Otherwise in case a man remain still beneath amongst ye
throng, that is to say, if thou have no smatche at all ne sauouring of any
excellent good thing above the common sort: thou shall oftentimes hear yesame
deceitful saying: lo here is Christ, and lo yonder he is. The phariseis they
cry: lo here is Jesus. The sadducees, they cry, behold, here he is. The
Ebeonites, they cry: behold, he is here. An other poynteth to sum one of the
Pharisaical sort, clad in a black frocke or cope, and says: look this way,
here is Christ. An other again, shows toward an other of the Pharisaicall
sort going in a white wede, and says: behold, here is Christ: an other
fellow showing many sundry colors and shapes of vestures, cries here is
Christ, here, here, here. An other shows to one that eats nothing but
fish, and says: here is Christ. An other shows the gelded sort that are
forbidden to mary, and says: here is Christ. O Iewishe and unbelieving
nacio^. Art thou minded or willing to se Christ? Climme up to the tree on high,
and take unto thee the iyes of Zacheus. He is not fain to see the robe of
Jesus, but he coueteth to see and know his face. And the face of Jesus is
covered in ye holy scriptures. Draw aside the veil, lift up thine
understanding to tho things which are within it: and thou shall see Jesus,
thou shall see from whence true health and rede^pcio^ issues forth unto us.
The pharisee, he goes iettyng bolt vpryghte, being in an high conceipte of
himself, and taking unto himself as his own due right, the praise of
righteousness, and taking unto himself the knowlage of the law: and while he
thinks himself as great a man as needs to be even with the largest, and
nigh enough unto Christ even hard at his elbow: he will not vouchesafe but
thinks skorne to use the sure help of the tree: but Zacheus being low in
his own iyes, both climmed up to the tree, and sees that he wishes to see.
Math. xxi. Mark. xi.
Yea and peradventure this figtree too was like unto that same other figtree,
which the lord accursed, because that by the freashe grenesse of the leaves,
it made one that were hungry believe that he should find fruit upon it, where
as in deed it had none: yet it was now time that after the figures of the law,
and after the holy sayings of the prophets, it should bring forth the fruit
of euangelical godliness. This was thatsame figtree, which the Lord commanded
to be cut up by the root, unless, wha^ dou^g were laid about the rote
thereof, it would leave to be still barain, and it was nigh barain in deed,
Luke. xiii.
had not zacheus climmed up and stand upon it. That same stem of the Iudaical
figtree, brought forth gross, unsavory, and unripe people: but after that
zacheus had climed up the tree, that is to say, as soon as the people of the
Gentiles was graffed in: now begone it to bring forth fruit, such as the
Lord Jesus loves. Of the Jews he was many hundred years looked for: at last he
came unto the^, he walked to and fro daily in coumpany with them, and yet was
not known among them. The people of the Gentiles had no more but heard of the
fame and report of Jesus: and being enkiendled with love to know the same Jesus,
who^ the Jews hanged upon the tree, they ran before the Jews in feruentnes
of faith: and acknowelagyng their own unrighteousness, low as they were,
contemned the lettre of ye law, conte^ned the ceremonies and figures (which
the Jews eue^ yet at this day embrace for the very true substance of the
things selfs,) and thorough evangelical faith they see Jesus passing by in
his Apostles, and acknowlage him, and thereby deserve to have Jesus cum to them
to be their geaste, and of his own offer to soiourne in their house,
forasmuch as the unbelief of the Jews had expulsed and banished him away from
them. All this while does little zacheus sit still in the tree with ready
iyes lokyng for Jesus that was yet cummyng a good preatie way of, and was not
yet thoroughly taught by what mark he might know Jesus, saving only that he
was in a perfect hope and trust of the thing which he earnestly wished and
desired. But when the people came to the sycomore tree, zacheus peradventure
was a matier of laughter, and a good sport to a great many, forasmuch as
being a welthie rich man, and in the office of customer, he stood alofte in
a tree to be a gazer upon one man and no mo. For he coueted not to know any
other man saving only Jesus. when jesus came to the place: he looked up.
Than Jesus being delited with the notable fainnesse of the man, which
fainnesse he showed by his very fact, by his countenance, and by his earnest
lookyng with his iyes: albeit Jesus had espied him before too, yet to show unto
the Jews an exsaumple of prompt beleuyng, he cast up his iyes on high, and
saw zacheus. And look for no less at all times then some notable benefit of
salvation, as often as Jesus does vouchesafe to look upon any person. For
his iyes have a medicinable kind of charming. The other sought no more but
only to see him: but in vain does such a party see Jesus, who^ Jesus does
not again vouchesalue to behold with his iyes. Auaunce thyself up from low
and vile things: and Jesus will look up unto thee. The loking of Jesus upon
any man has a portion of good lykelyhood to come: but a matier and token of
greater bliss it is to hear Jesus voice. For where zacheus did no more ne none
other but behold Jesus, the Lord of his own mere mocion, said unto him,
Zacheus come down at once.
calling him even by his name too, as a man known unto him: zacheus come
thou down quickly, for this day must I soiourne in thy house. We have heard
how the Lord has oftentimes goen to dyners to me^nes houses wha^ he has been
desired: but we have not at any time heard that ever he did of his own mind
come in and make himself a geaste with any man when he was not bydden. Yea and
so to do is of all men for the most part, taken for a point of homely
courtesy, but the Lord had beholden the affeccion and heart of the man within,
who set so much by having a sight of him, as he passed by. He would have
assayed somewhat ferther had not his own privy knowelage of his
unworthiness been a let thereof. Thus did he think in his own mind:
Blissed are these that have had the hap to cleue unto such an one, and whose
hap it is to behold his face daily in presence with him, and whose chance
it is to hear his voice standing hard by him. The Jews and none others have
so much good hap. I am a Publicane. It is even with the largest for such an
one as I am, to have had a syghte of him as he passed by. There had come no
word out of his mouth to bydde Jesus to his house, but such an heart was
an excedyng courteous bidder of a geaste: and the Lord Jesus loves well to be
bidden after such a sort. Such an one, as upon acknowelageyng of his own
weakness in his conscience, dares not be so bold as to crave the thing
which he wishes, and in his heart would fayn have, such an one does obtain
more, then another that bids Jesus to his house, as though he would bind
Jesus unto him, for dooyng him such a pleasure. Peter never came nerer unto
Christ, then when he said: Go out away from me master, Luke. v. Luke. vii.
Math. viii.
for I am a fellow that am a sinner. That other man also was a piththie and an
earnest bidder of Jesus, which said unto him: Master, I am not a man
worthy that thou shouldeste enter under the roufe of my house: For Jesus was
now already in the said parties house (which was a certain Centurion) when
his young fellow was made whole, though Jesus body came not there. For there
is Jesus, wheresoever is health and recovery. And here Jesus thirsted the
redemption of mankind, and therefore he bids Zacheus to come down quickly.
For now was it time that redemption which was to pass away from the Jews,
should be transposed and put over to the congregation of the Gentiles: for
there must Jesus soiourne and abide until the consummacion and very last end
or closing up of all times to come, because he might not be suffered to abide
among the Jews. From an high he had stand watchyng for Jesus through feith: he
came down to the office and duty of godly devotion: And he came down hastily.
for it is not enough to vieu Jesus and to gaze upon him, as often as he needs
a place of soiournyng: and thereof has Jesus need, as often as ye neighbor
has need. And what does Zacheus hereupon not a word does he give to
answer (for earnest affeccion of the heart does often use to take away a
man's speaking) but he does as he is bidden without making any tariaunce,
down comes he quickly. For it is not convenient to tarry, whansoeuer Jesus
calls us. The Jews were called, and they make their excuses: but Zacheus
being very foreward and full of reioycyng, entreteyned Jesus in his house. O
raiserable synagogue that it was, which lost a geaste of Jesus: and O happy
house of the church that it is, which through her good promptness did provoke
Jesus the author and geuer of all heavenly bliss to come unto it. Well thus
now thou see the original begynnyg of the church being gathered together
of the gentiles. Now consider well a saumple and pattern of the Iewishe envy.
The people, when they saw Jesus so much inclined toward the favor of the
Publicane, that of his own voluntary mocion he had bid himself as a geaste
into his house: made a murmouryng because he had gone to soiourne with a fellow
that was a sinner. He is goen to tarrye with a man that is a sinner.
O righteousness foul stained and odious before god, which could rather
mind to disdeigne, then to be healed: and could rather mind to grutche at
the neighbor, then to leat the same have any part with it. To a fellow (quod
they) that is a sinner: and as though it were not the principal sin of al
other, to have envy at the neighbor, and as though such an one may be an
honest man, which grutcheth that his brother should be in the state of grace.
Why stands thou without the doors of the congregation, thou envious Jew? It
is open for the to enter in also, if thou will. That in case thou refuse so to
do, yet has Jesus determined to abide in zacheus house. The Gentiles are not a
little proud of such a geaste, whom they had never looked for. And so much
the better welcome it is, because it has so happened, not only without any
their deseruyng, but also contrary to their expectacion. And even as murmouryng
was made now at this present against Jesus: so was there a great murmouryng
made afterward against Peter, for Cornelius the Centurion, when it was said
unto him: Acts. x.
wherefore haste thou gone in unto men uncircumcised? but what is here done all
this while? Zacheus contemnyng the murmouryng of the people Judicial, stands
before Jesus, makes suit also to be taken into the noumbre of his disciples,
showing thereby how far he had grown and proceeded forward. behold lord
half of my gooddes I give to the poor.
For he says unto Jesus: behold O Lord, I give away half of my gooddes
among the poor, and in case I have defrauded any man of a ferthyng, I here
promise to give him four times as much again for it. Hear thou this thou
Pharisee? Zacheus makes no rehearsal of his oblacions or sleaghyng of beasts
in sacrifice, not choice of meats, not fastings, Luke. xviii
not holidays, not solemnysyng of sabbothes, not washynges: he makes no
vauntes ne braggues of his vesture, or of his sect of religion: but he
brings with him the works of charity. In these points, the sinner is
better then the just persons, and the Publicane passes such as glory of
their own holiness. For the said Pharisee being a setter forth of his own
manyfold good deeds, he gave but only the tenth part of his gooddes to the
poor: this man gave the one half, and gave it not of his pollyng gaynes: but
if any penny has been gotten with falsehood, he restored the same with
thencreace of four times double so much again. And moreover of his gooddes
that he had justly and truly come by, Luke. xi. Mat. xxiii.
he gave the one moite in charity unto the nedie. O the course of things
meruailously turned in and out. What was withinforth in the Pharisees, the same
was replete with rauine and guyle: and of Zacheus we have an upright true
dealyng man and a liberal, whereas he is a man not only rich but also a
Publicane, yea and an head manne of this trade, whereby he was so much the more
abhorred among the Jews. But the Lord passes not of men's titles or styles:
he beholds the mind of the manne and estemeth him by his deeds, yea of such
deeds (I say) as do proceed forth of feith and charity. Luke. xviii
Neither did Zacheus speak the premises on himself in the way of making any
vaunt or boste, in sort as the foresaid Pharisee did, being as a trumpe of
his own righteousness, and a scorner of the Publicane. Zacheus does not
set his own righteousness before another parties righteousness: but as a
man both a sinner and a Publicane he opens in plain words without
dissimulacion, that he had an earnest mind and desire to the exercise of
righteousness, yea even before he had any sight of Jesus, of whom he is
desirous to be enstructed whether he did well, or no: and what was ferther to
be dooen for the geattyng of everlasting life. For so was it expediente that
these words of Zacheus should be heard of the envious Jews, and should
be allowed of Christ in the hearing of the same Jews. For it was not possible
for him more piththily and effectuallye to lay unto the Jews their pollyng
facions, their auaryce, and their catchyng of other men's gooddes: who did not
only give out nothing of their own unto the neighbor being in need, but also
under the color of godliness defrauded the parents of the succor due unto
them at their childrens hands. Jesus therefore turnyng to the murmouryng Jews,
said: This I plainly affirm unto you, that health is come to this house this
present day, forasmuch as the same also perteyneth to Abraham, as being
father unto it, in whom is all your glorying that he is the first founder of
your generation. For whatsoever person does in feith, in sincerity of life,
and in godly devotion resemble Abraham, the same is the son of Abraham and
free partaker of the blissing in old time promised unto Abraham. The stock of
this man being of an other blood from the stock of Abraham, This day is
health happened unto this house.
is no let unto him, nor his sort and trade of life having heretofore been
passed over in sinfulness, but whatsoever person conuertyng and emending from
his former life does enbrace the doctrine of the gospel, whosoever following
the steps of Abraham, does ensue true righteousness, the same is the child
and true heir unto Abraham. For of such will not the soonne of man think
disdeigne, who came into the world for the very purpose, to seek that was
goen a straygh, and to save that was lost. Such sinners as this, are more
acceptable unto God, then these that swell in a false persuasion of
righteousness.

and because they thought that the kingdom of God should shortelye appear. He
said therefore: A certain noble man went into a far country to receive him
a kingdom and to come again. And he called his ten servants and delivered
them ten pound saying unto them: Occupye ye till I come. But his citezens
hated him, and sent a message after him saying: We will not have this man to
reygne over us. And it came to pass, that when he had received his kingdom,
he returned, and commanded these servants to be called unto him (to whom he
had given the money) to we^e how much every manne had dooen. Than came ye
first, saying: Lord, thy pound has gained ten pound. And he said unto
him: well, thou good servant, because thou have been feithfull in a veraye
little thing, have thou authority over ten cities. And another came saying:
Lord, thy pound has made five pound. And to the same he said: be thou rewler
also over five cities. And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy
pound, which I have kept in a napkyn, for I feared thee, because thou art a
straight man, thou take up, that thou laydest not down, and reapest that thou
did not sow. He says unto him: Of thine own mouth will I judge thee,
thou eiuell servant. Know thou that I am a straight man, taking up that I
laid not down, and reapyng that I did not sow? And wherefore gave not thou
my money into the bank, and at my cummyng I might have required mine own with
vauntage? And he said unto them that stood by: take from him that pound, and
give it to him that has ten pound. And they said unto him: Lord he has
ten pound. For I say unto you, that unto every one which has, shall be
given, and he shall have abundance: and from him that has not, shall be taken
away even that which he has. Moreover those mine enemies, (which would not
that I should reign over them) bring hither, and sleagh them before me. By
this talk Jesus did declare that from hensfoorth none ought to glory in the
obseruyng of the law, but whatsoever good quality or gift of grace had
happened unto any man by the bounteous liberality of god, y^ same should be
wholly employed to such end, yt we may draw very many men to grace and
salvation thereby. For with such kind of gaynes is God most specially
delited, who had sent his own son for this purpose, that freely forgeuyng
their sins he might join all the nations of the world unto him. And in deed
some there were among the disciples which thought, that as soon as he were
once come to Jerusalem, which he begoonne now to draw somewhat nere unto,
the kingdom of heaven would immediately appear, of which he had so many times
made mention: wherein their imaginacion ran upon some kingdom like to a
worldely reygne, whereas Christ meant of a reign of the spirit evangelical,
by mean whereof, the tyranny of sins is oppressed and trodden under foot.
And that kingdom certes consists not in puissaunce of armed soldiers, in
weapon, or in force of hands, but in feith and trust in god, but in
beneficial goodness toward the neighbor, but in mercifulness toward
offenders, but in sincere and liberal dispensyng of the word of God. But as
for the majesty of this kingdom, which shall honorably reward the godly
with immortal glory, and shall adiudge the wiekedde unto endless torments,
he declared that it should not streightwayes be showed forth, but should be
made open and manifest at the due time being to us unknown. And ferther that
we should in the mean season by all means and ways employe our earnest
diligence, that the good gift or quality that every body has, he should
first remember to be the lords money, to whom we are debtours for all that
we have: and that the money which we have so received, ought uprightly and
feythfully to be distributed abroad to the gaynes and profit of the same
Lord: not that he has need of any manier thing, but because that of his
charity and love toward mankind, he thirsts the redemyng and salvation of
all creatures, and thinks himself encreaced with a great advantage and
gain, if one man emende by another from viciousness, and be converted from
vice to the earnest exercise of godly devotion, whereby he may have what to
reward in both parties, as well the one that helps with doing benefit, as
also the other which has been helped. For there is nothing that we may in
this behalf take into our own possession either of praise o^els of thank. We
are servants every one of us, and of bounden duty owe our best labor and
service.

All the stock of the money is his every whyt of it, yea and owene^ he is of
us ourselfes too: we must no more but labor every man to the best of his
power, to increase the Lords substance. As touching the reward, leat us leave
the arbitrament there of to the Lord, who will at his convenient time most
largely reward our prompte will, and our faithful endeavoring. The discourse of
the parable is this here ensuing.

A certain man of nobility and great power, A certain noble man went into a
far country.
took a voyage into a far country to recover the possession of a realm into
his hands again, which an other had through tira^ny usurped and prevented the
possession of before, and that doe^ to return home again. But this great man
before he entered his journey, called together certain of his servants which
he had, to the number of ten, and delivered te^ne pounds unto them, in sort,
that there was an equal division of this stock of money indifferently among
them al: and therwithal gave them in commission. This money (says he) I
deliver unto you, not to consume it wastfully or to keep it idle in your hands,
but that it may e^creace by ye trade of occupiyng, and to the end that being
returned home again, I may find my substance well increased at home. And all
things thus set in order at home, he went forth on his voyage.

And so it was that the inhabitauntes of the city which he was rewler and
governor of, we will not have this manne too reign oue^ us.
hated him. Whereupon as soon as he was gone forth on his iourneye, they
begoone to treacte of a change, attemptyng such a matter, that while he were
in recoueryng his other kingdom, he should be expulsed out of that that he had
than already in possession. Upon this they sent ambassadors unto him being
now a good way onwarde on his journey, to make relacion unto him, that his
subjects were of such mind, that from henceforth they would no longer have
him to their king, and that therefore he should not make the labor any more to
return home again to them from whence he had taken that present voyage. But
so it befell that wha^ he had recovered into his possession the other kingdom,
for which he had taken the said voyage, he returned home again to his own
realm: and commanded his servants to be called before him, to whom he had
to fore delivered the stock of ten pounds, that the audite and accou^ptes
duly made, he might know how much every of them had gotten of clear gaynes.
The first came forth, who being demanded of his accoumpt, said: My lord; thy
pound is enprowed to the sum of ten pounds.

Whose industry and fidelity his lord much praisyng, Lord the pound has
gayued ten pound.
answered: well said my good servant, forasmuch as when my substance was
such as might have lien in a narow room, thou have in a little sum of money
declared thy self faithful, trusty and loving toward thy master: now that
my substance is enlarged, it is reason and conscience, that thou be partaker
of my welthyer state.

Take thou unto thee the rule of ten cities. After this servant, cu^meth the
second, who being required his accoumpte, said: My Lord, thy pound which
thou deliueredst me for a stock to occupy, has increased five pou^des to thy
behoufe. This man's industry also, though inferior to the other, yet his
lord did very well commend: and according to the rate of thine industrye
(says he) be thou also a rewler over five cities. Wha^ the resydue also upon
their accoumpte and rekenyng made and given up, had been rewarded with some
dignity every one according to their rate more or less: at last came a
servant even one alone the most slothful luske of all that ever were, and
of the wurste honesty to be put in trust or credit. Who, when his master
required his straight accoumpte, made him this answer. My lord, behold here I
bring you again the pound which ye put me in trust withal. I have kept it
ever sense that time hitherto safely laid up in a cloute, because ye should
have it again safe and sound as it was. I have so well avoided to be a wastfull
spender of it, that I have not so much as once touched it with my hands. And
so thought I better to do, then to come in hasarde or peril, lest if mine
occupiyng had ill framed, I should have had buisines with you. For I was
afraid of you, as one not ignorant what a rigorous cruel man ye are, and
covetous of lucre, in so much that ye will not only give nothing of your
own: but also will take away from thence where ye laid nothing at all, and
will gather in harvest, from such places, where ye never sowed grain. Than the
lord not only offended with the slothfulness of his servant, but also for
that he laid his own fault on the conditions of his master: Of thine own
mouth I judge the thou evil servant. etc.
being thoroughly out of patience, he said: Thou slothful servant, and
untrusty fellow, yea and moreover a false accuser of thy master, thou have
given sentence against thine own head. Thou know (thou say,) that I am a
rygorous cruel man, and covetous of lucre, taking up money from thence where I
laid down none, and reaping there where I sowed nothing at all. And yet
thatsame very point ought to have quickened the to some actiuitie in best
yr^yng thee to have delivered forth my money to the kepers of the bank. For I
would doubtelesse have comen, and would have straightly required it together
with the increase of entresse, because I had for such a purpose put it into
thy hands, that it should increase through thee. At these words of ye lord,
when the unprofitable servant held his peace and had not a word to speak,
the lord said to the others that stood by. Take ye a way the pound from him,
and give it unto him that has the ten pounds. The other servants
meruailyng thereat, said: my lord, what needs to give him here any more? he
is rich and welthy enough. For he has ten pound. Than said the Lord: It
forces not to you what he has: So have I thought it good: and so does it
stand with reason and equity in this rekenyng, that whose has with his
faithful industry increased his masters substance, Unto every one which
has shall be ge^^.
my bounteous goodness must unto such an one give some ferther surplusage,
to the end he may still have more and more abundance. Contrariewise, whosoever
has by reason of his slothfulness gotten himself no gaynes at all, such an
ones need shall my liberality so little help, that even the very same that he
has too, shall be taken away from him. The stock was mine, and the gains and
increase thereof due to me: your parts it was, to perform your due labor.
Now I bountifully give unto you both the stock, and also the increase of
the same. Thus far the Lord Jesus did by a derke and mystical form of
speaking teach his disciples: that in ye buisy trade of preaching the
gospel, every man ought to show himself faithful and industrious even to
the vttermoste, and as for their reward to look for, at the secounde coming
of the lord, at what time he shall now appear mighty and high after that the
kingdom of the church shall be recovered into his hands and delivered up to his
father. For at the first, Jesus was known but in Iewry only, he seemed to be
but a little king or duke of one city and no more, when the deiuyll reigned
without redress throughout all the universal nacyons of the world, as in a
royalme that was an other man's and none of his. And the same Jesus couetyng
to recover into his own possessyon again through preaching the gospel,
that Satan had by tyranny entered upon, leafte the land of the Jews, and
took a voyage into heaven: but not till he had first diligently enstructed
his dyscyples to the trade of occupying in the affairs of the gospel, which
his discyples he put in trust with the dyspensacyon of the word of God
contained in the gospel, as a certain stock to play the occupiers withal,
whereof great gaynes might grow unto the lord being right covetous of such
mannier increase: and he put them in trust that they should draw unto the
kingdom of the gospel whomesoeuer they might, Publicanes, harlottes,
soldiers, Greeks, Romans, Scithians, Frenchemen, Gothians, Sarmatians, and
all others. And that this they should do until the lords return, who will
come again in the end of this world, to distribute unto every one
everlasting rewards for their deeds. And come again will he not, unless he
shall first have subdued the world to the domynyon and empire of the
gospel, and all the nacyons of the whole world to join together into one
church and congregation. But while he earnestely goes about this by mean of
his disciples: the Jews, (among whom alone and no more, God hitherto seemed
for to reign, by reason of their knowlage of the law and of the authority and
being in the right trade of religyon:) being his subjects, of whom and
among whom he was borne, whereas they ought specially above all others to
have loved him, and by all mannier means to stick to him in recoueryng his
kingdom: did not only do him no help at all, but also were a let agayns^e
him, crying before the chyefe Justice and judge: We have no king but Ceasar.
And the self same thing did they again afterward, playnelye denouncyng
unto the Apostles and commaundyng them to make no more mention from that time
furthewarde of the name of Jesus. Moses they were willing to have to their
king: Christ would they none of. For they hated him, because he contraryed
their naughty lusts and appetites. We see even yet still at this day too,
after what sort the nacyon of the Jews have withdrawn themselves from the
kingdom of the gospel, and with how stiff and stubberne hatefulnes they
have conspired against him, unto whom is given by his father all power in
heaven and in earth. We will not have this manne (say they) to reygne over us:
and while they will in no wise serve Christ, they are as bond slaves unto all
the tirannes of this world: they are bond servants to Satan a most
merciless tiranne: and where they se here and there in every place throughout
the whole world, the Christians to rejoice in the freedom of the spirit:
they do yet still hold fast with their teeth the unsavory lettre, to whom
they are bound, like unto men assigned and appointed to the glebe or turfe.

But (the said Jews in vain crying against him,) the kingdom of the
church is recovered and established: in geatting and establishyng whereof, as
many as shall have done their feythfull travail, shall be crouned with glory
and honor in the kingdom of heaven, according to the quantitee or rate of the
fruicte, which they have brought in the lords vineyarde. But now the Jews
being obstinatelye unbelieving, what reward shall they have? Even that thing
also did the Lord declare in the residue of the same parable at the latter
end. For after that he had punished the untrusty seruaun^e, he said
moreover: yea and those subjects of mine, in nation my countrymen, but in
heart enemies, which by a sedicious ambassade sent unto me, prayed me that I
should no more come to be their king, ne to reygne over them, bring ye them
hither that they may be put to death even here in my syghte, and be punyshed
of me for their rebellyon. This punyshmente is death everlasting, which a
bydethe all such as obey not the gospel and glad tidings of the son of
God. For at that time shall they worthylye find him impossible to be
appeaced, forasmuch as they now obstinately contemned him being mylde and
full of mercy.

The lord when he had spoken the premises, went forth on toward
Jerusalem, where he should afterward accomplish thatsame excellent
sacrifice for the redempcyon of mankind, and out of the beakon place of the
cross, he should (like a covetous and an ambicious king) pluck al things
unto himself. For although there have every where been many in times paste,
and many hereafter shall be, which will cry by their very deeds, we will
not have this man to be king over us: yet is there no nation so far distau^t
or out of the way from the Jews, from whence he shall not pluck a very
great noumber unto him. Wherefore he does eftsoon beat into their heads in
fact, that he had before represented in zacheus: which thing he did anon
after in a longer parable express more at large. For the lord does in the
mean while procure the same thing, which he procured many times before also:
which was, that it might be clear and euidente unto all creatures, that
whatsoever he should afterward suffer, he did of his own accord willingly
and wetingly suffer it, and otherwise that he was of power to do whatsoever
his will was to do. And now forasmuch as he had determined by the mean of the
most extreme worldely shame and fall that might be, to recover into his
possession the highest glory possible among men, and the disciples being not
yet fullye apt ne hable to receive the understanding of this mystery, did
look for some matier (whatsoever it was) of great royalty, and a thing of
some high enterprise to the estymacion of the world at the lords hands: It
pleased him before his death for a little season, to flatter or rather to mock
their affeccions, and also to mock the glory of this world* showing how
vain it is and how slippie to trust to, seeing that after so great tokens
of joyful receyuyng of him, after so many cryinges and shoutes made in his
honor, after so much earneste favor of the people, death on the cross did
immediatelye follow in the neck thereof. When Jesus therefore was come to the
mount which is called Oliuete, nere unto two little towns situate in the
side of the same mount, from whence Jerusalem was now before them within
sight: he sent out two of his disciples on an erand. Go your ways (says
he) to the little town that ye see yonder foreryght against you, at the
entreyng whereof ye shall see a young colte of an Ass standing tied without
the doors, unbroken as yet for any manne to ride on, on whom has never any
man sitten: untie him and bring him to me. That if any body shall be against
it, and demand: wherefore do ye untie the colte: Ye shall thus answer him:
the lord has need of him. The dyscyples departed, they found the colte tied,
they address to looce him. And in the while were there certain persons
present who asked, as ye would say, being against their dooyng, why do ye
looce the colte? They (as they had tofore been commanded) made answer: The
Lord has need of him. The name of the lord being o^s heard, they suffered the
colte to beled away. Than brought they him unto Jesus. And when they saw
that the lord was minded to mount upon him, (the like whereof for all that he
had never tofore that time used to do:) the dyscyples because he should not
upon the bare rydge of the colte sit to much uneasily, And as he went, they
spread their clothes on the way.
cast their robes abroad upon the beasts back. And now Jesus sitting on the
coltes back, and going onward, some spread abroad their garments even on the
very way, partly for to do him honor, and partly lest the colte being
unbroken, and also unshod, should hurt his hoofes with stu^blyng at the stones.
And when they were now come to the foot of the hill, and were going directly
toward the city of Jerusalem, a certain wonderful affeccion suddenly took
the hertes of all the people, of whom some had come in the train of Jesus,
and some had come forth of Jerusalem to mete him. For every body who could
do best strawed the way that the lord went on, with the branches of trees
every where broken of, and both with great joy and also with loud voices they
begoon to laud god for all his benfites and miracles which they had seen and
heard wrought by Jesus. There souned on every side the voices of people
rejoicing at his cummyng, as it had been to God cummyng in triumph, Blessed be
the king yt comes in the name of the lord.
and of men crying in honor of him: Osanna in the hygheste: Blessed be he
that cummeth in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory in the
highest. This was the voice of the multitude of al sorts, and especially of
young folks, who as it had been by a certain inspiracion of God, the envy
and grutchyng of the Phariseis contemned, did in the open face of the world
give testimony unto the lord Jesus.

But there were in the same multitude certain Phariseis, whom thyssame crying
out to Christ in welcummynge him, did much agrieue: because the same did
outwardelye show as though they would have all the world to know, that
some thing there was in Jesus (whatsoever it was,) above the rate of a man. And
emonge these Phariseis some there were that warned Jesus, that himself with
his own mouth by his authority, should restreigne these same ungodly shoutes
of the multitude, procedynge of a certain unmeasurable favor of the people
toward their master, and therefore unpleasant even to the lord self, who
did not use to acknowlage such high praises. Master (say the Phariseis)
rebuke thy dyscyple (...) Jesus never went about to still the devout profession
of the plain meaning people, but by a byword cheeked the blindenes of the
Phariseis, who were not ashamed to attribute unto Beelzebub the prince of
deuylles such things as Jesus hyghlye well did and wroughte. But he made
answer again. With what face should I suppress them that woorthily sing
glory unto god, and with devout voices now synging the same which was many a
long day sens spoken by the prophets? If these hold their peace, than shall
the stones cry.
Thus much I say unto you for a certayntie: God so much wills this his
laud not to be vndeclared, that in case men would altogether hold their
peace, the veraye stones here would cry it out. And truly harder then the
stones be those, which being with so many benefytes, with so many miracles
provoked, can not yet be moved in their hearts to speak in the aduauncemente
of Gods glory. Than with such pomp as this, triumphaunt like, and with
such a train about him, did the lord Jesus go unto Jerusalem. For such a
little taste of this worlds glory it lyked him to take, before he would take
the cross upon him: and this professing of his godhed did he parforce wring
out of the same nation, by which he should anon after be most cruelly dooen
to death, to the end the Jews might be condemned by their own sentence: for
that they had crucified their Messiah and salueour. But now in this story of
these gestes, there is hidden and comprised no small point of mystery. The she
Ass that was the dame, was standing, and the colte also was standing which
was the Asses fool. The dame had already been woonte to be ryden on, as being
of long continuance enured to wear the yoke of the law, sygnifying
doubtless the nation of the Jews. The colte being the fool of this she Ass,
(for redemption took the first beginning of the Jews,) the colte (I say)
betokenyng the people of the Gentiles, was yet unbroken, neither at any time
charged with the yoke of the law, nor yet through evangelical obedyence
carrying Jesus as a sitter on his back. Both beasts were tied: for on the one
side the Sinagogue lived in bondage under the carnalitie of the law, not
atteygnynge to the freedom of the spirit: and the Gentiles on the other side
were entangled with the decrees of the philosophiers, and subject to the
wurshippyng of Idolles and deiuilles. They had at that season owners
indifferente as well of the one as of the other; yea and such masters not a
few. For in the peoples as well of the Jews as also of the Gentiles, a great
mayny were bound to couetise, to Leachery, to ambicion, to envy, and to many
other both filthy and also merciless masters. Than two Apostles do at the
lords commandment untie them, that is to wete, Peter the teacher of
circumcision, that is to say, of the Jews, and Paul the teacher of the
Gentiles, when through evangelical faith, and baptism they forgive both the
one and the other all the transgressions of their former life, so that being
now looced they may from hensfurth be worthy to have Jesus a sitter on them.
For this power gave he unto his dysciples, not only among the Jews but also
among the Gentiles, that whatsoever they looced in yearthe, the same should
be loo^ed in heaven too. And what meruayl if the other former owners can not
let the untying of them: seeing that they which do untie them, do untie
them by the commandment of that same newer master, whose will no creature
can resist? This new master has need of such manier beasts, and on the
back of such ones does he rejoice to sit as do simplye obey without
any fraud, or drawing back: such as with good heart and mind do take
upon them the sweet yoke of evangelical doctrine: such as will not be
skittishe ne prauncynge against the sytter on them: such as with a quiet and
ientle soft pace do bear and glorifye the Lord Jesus in their bodies,
until they come even full into the holy city and temple of the lord: I mean
not that same city the common murderer of prophets: but that other heavenly
city, which knows not what rebellion does mean. Worldely princes love
fyerce stieryng coursers, foled even purposely for wars, and well broken and
taught thereafter: the lord Jesus loves such manier Asses, as will mekelye
and stilly carry their meke master, and will not cast him when he sits on
them. This facyon of carrying, do the haulte princes of this world laughe at:
the Philosophiers with their disdaynfull looks do laugh at: the Phariseis
swellyng in pride do laughe at: and think themselves fortunate that they
carry the deiuill on their backs, the rougheste sytter possible and the most
unfavorable: that they live in bondage of so many most merciless masters,
whereas to serve this one master Christ is an heaven. There is nothing in
more happy and blissed case then these little and simple ones, after they be
once looced from bondage, and after they have once received Jesus upon their
back. After worldely estimacion, the ignorauntes, the simple sort, and such
as can no skyll of fraud or falsehoode, appear to be of the Assishe kind:
but they have the lord to their directour, who will not leat them straygh out
of the way: who not only vouchesalueth to sytte on their backs, but also to
have his habytacion in their hearts, which he governs with his own
spirit. And the beasts were bare until than: but the Apostles do cover the^
al over with their robes, that is, with their doctrine, and with exaumples of
holy conversation preparing them for Jesus to geatte up upon, which Jesus what
he once did after the fleashe, the same he never ceassethe to do after the
spirytuall sense. The way was rough: but the same way do the disciples make
sure enough to go upon by spreadyng their garments abroad upon it: that is,
showing the way of godly conversation to be easy, in case a man going by the
exaumples of the holy, submit himself to be under the lord Jesus. Than go
they upon branches of palms, and upon green leaves of trees, that is, by the
memory of the mattirs, the virgins, and the confessoures, continuallye bearyng
flowers, and keeping their freashe grenesse. For what a great noumber of good
exaumples does on every side offer themselves unto such as are entered in the
way of godly devotion? Great store of such exau^ples do the very books of the
Jews minister eue^ to the Gentiles also. And these show tokens of gladness in
this coltes behalf, who^oeuer they be that acknowleage Christ for their
lord and owner. Neither do there want Phariseis at this day too, ne never
shall want or fail, in whom the glory of Chrste shall cause heart burning
and envy. For they had lieffer have it cried unto themselves: Osanna in the
highest, lauded be he, which comes in ye name of ye lord: whereas they come
not in the lords name, but in their own. But the Jews even at this day
keeping silence of the glory of Christ which they have envy at, the stones
vnceassauntly cry it out being now become the children of Abraham. Here do
the people of Jerusalem cry, away with him, away with him, do him on the
cross: Irishe men, Scotts, English men, French men, Sarmacians, Germans
cry: landed be he that comes in the name of the lord. Such people as while
they set their hearts on aduauncyng their own glory, do labor to derken
the glory of Christ, and those which for the respect of their own private
commodytye do suppress and deprave or corrupt the sincerity of holy
Scripture: while they desire to have their own greatness set out in men's
talk, and the glory of Christ to be leaft unspoken: all such veraylye play
the parts of those Phariseis which attempted to stop the mouths of the
children of the Hebrews, which children God had enspyred to sing forth the
glory of his name and of his son, whom he had given a salueour unto the
world. Yea, and this poyncte also has some wholesome significacion in it,
that there is first a stiepe cumming down from the mount of Oliuete, and than
afterward an even and smoothe way over a plain, and anon again an other
going up unto the mount of Sion, (for upon this mount of Sion was the temple
of the Lord builded.) Except the former mount had oil whereby the light of
feyth might be nourished and maynteyned, there could be no cummyng down from
the affyaunce of the law, by which the Jews swel in pride, nor from trustyng
in philosophy, by which the Gentiles think themselves ioly fellows. For the
first step and degree of growing forward in goodness, is through feyth.
But than must we approach the house of the cheke (for Bethphage is so much to
say in the Sirians tongue.) For this is the cheke, not that puffethe up in
haultenesse of mind or look, but that is ready to come forth with the
confession of our offenses committed against God. Neither must we be far
from Bethanie, which is called the house of obedyence. For all creatures are
not obediente unto the gospel. But yet herehence comes the beginning of
health. After the downehyll, the way lies over a plain, being on every side
strawen with the branches of good exaumples, until we eftsoon come to the
rysyng up of the hill toward the mount of Sion, which is called the tooryng
hylle, or peake, or high beacon place, or watchyng toure from whence to see a
far of. For this is verayly that same high top of virtue, out of which, as
it were out of an high peake or beakon place, although things are a great way
beneath looked down upon, and contemned, of which this world makes great
moustre and show, as if they were high things above the moon. And the mind
being now drawyng well toward heaven, beholds such things as are
everlasting, and the which do surmount the coumpasse of al man's reason.

And when the lord Jesus was now come so far onward, that Jerusalem was
somewhat nere, and was full in fight before him: viewing and beholding the same
city, portely and gorgeous of buildinges, flourishing, in men, in richesse,
and in opinion of holiness and devotion toward God, proud of their state
that the world was in at that present day, and void of all thought and care,
by reason they knew not of thextreme distress and myserie that was to come
upon them: he being earnestly moved with compassion wept, and with words
suddenly brastyng out without any such talk before going, as it were one
sighing and sobbing for sorrow, he much lamented the destruccyon of the same
city, and spoke to this effect ensuyng. If thou also dyddest now, as well as
I do, know this day of thine, in which is offered unto thee peace and
remission of thy great sins past: thou wouldeste earnestlye set thy mind
to embrace that is offered.

Forsooth this is thy day, in which thou art occasioned to emendemente, and in
which the goodness of God prouokethe thee to repentance: and does provoke
thee with the hygheste and vttermoste degree of bounteous goodness, and with
so high a degree of goodness, that there can be no more dooen to it. The
mercifulness of God so often times despised of thee, vouchsalueth after a
certain new mannier to visit thee, to the end thou mayeste at lestewise by
this mean weaxe mylde and reformable. There will come an other day, not of
thine, but of the Romans, and of gods vengeance, at which thou will be
plagued for all thy great transgressyons, But now are they hidden from thine
iyes etc.
which thou have had more mind to heap more upon more, then to lamente or
be sorry for that is paste. But now thou neither knoweste thine own day, ne
forescest that other day to come which shall not be thine: because both the
one and the other is hydden from thine iyes, which are in thee almost vttrely
blinded with the drounkennesse of thy flouryshynge welthye state that thou art
in at this present. Thou neither have any remembrance of the eiuils past,
which thou have dooen: ne foreseest things to come, which hang over thy head,
nor acknowlagest the pressed goodness of God toward thee, which goodness of
god because thou do yet still most obstinately set at naught, O thou city
impossible to be recured, and a common murderer of all such as bring unto
thee any word of thy salvation or redempcyon, there shall come straungyers of
an other land against thee which shall bring utter destruction and ruin
upon thee. It will be thy lot to refuse and put from the thy Messiah, and in
his stead to chose Ceasar unto thy king. Thou shall therefore find and feel
thy kings cummyng unto thee with a far other furnyture and provision, then
thy king does now come unto thee, being a bringer of health, and a paceable
quiet king. Thou will not now receive him that cummeth to give health and
safegarde: Thy enemies shall cast a bank about thee, and coumpare the round etc.
and ere long shalt thou of force be compelled to receive that shall come to
give the utter confusion. For the princes of Rome, whom thou had preferred
before thine own king, shall come as enemies instead of kings with bendes
of men well armed and appoyncted for war: and first of all they shall
enuiron thee round about with trenches, so that there shall be no way open to
escape out, than shall they on every side encoumpace thee with men and
artillery, and shall with a most straight siege oppress thee, and finally, all
thyssame thy gaye building with temple and all, And they shall not leave in
the one stone slading on. etc.
they shall cast down as low as the ground. And not satisfied withal
thissame, they shall with an universal slaughter destruie thy children, of whom
thou art now proud, and do sembleably set them in a pride and a pomp by thy
gorgeous royalty, and all thyssame glory of thine they shall in such sort
wipe away from the root and foundation, that they shall not leave so much as
one stone standing fast mortised on an other, to the end there shall no
sign of thee remain, ne yet any hope of reedyfying thee again in time to
come. These things in deed shall be miserable to beeholde, but they shall
chance by thine own desert, because that being so often times occasioned,
long and many years gone by sundry prophets, and now also by John, and by thy
Messiah, Because ye know not ye time of thy visitacion.
thou do obstinately despise the mercy of God. Thou shall therefore f^le
the time of vengeance, which would not know the time of thy visitacion.
Even thou too as well as others (if thou had would) might have embraced
thy redemption being offered. Now at leastwise thou shall by thy confusion,
be an wholesome exaumple unto others, that they may not in like manier despise
the goodness of God, when it provoke the them to take better ways.

Jesus after he had spoken the premises, came to Jerusalem, and entered into
the temple, And he cast out them that sold therein, and the^ yt bought: Esaias.
lvi.
and drove out therhence such as were bying and selling there, saying: God
says in the scryptures: This same my house has been dedicated, not for the
trade of bying and sellyng, but for praying: but ye have turned it into a den
of thieves, spoiling all straungiers that come, and by your wicked lying in
awayte, procuring your own lucre, with the loss and damage of others. By this
fact the lord Jesus declared, how great destruction those persons do bring
into the church, who under the pretense and color of godly devotion apply
their minds altogether to filthye lucre: who under the title of devout
wurshipping of God, do attend their own profit, not feding their flock, but
taking away all the sweet from them, and with their vnpure doctrine sleaghing
the souls, whom their duties were with pure doctrine to bring unto life.

This dooen, the Lord, as one being now fully possessed in his own kingdom,
taught day by day in the temple, the incurable malice of the Phariseis
openly despised. But those which were highest in dignity among the priests,
and also the scribes, and the ringleders of the people, being netled
therewithal and stiered to wrath, sought some occasyon to cast away our
salueour. They lacked no maliciouse minds, but there appeared no hope of
bringyng their will to effect: They had heard the shoutynges of the people in
the honor of Jesus, they saw in the temple also the whole universal multitude
of the people to depend altogether of his sayings: so great was as well the
effectual pith, as also the grace of gods word. Their cold and feeble
doctrine concerning washynges, concerning the corbone, that is, their treasoury
of the church, concerning the true tythynge of myntes and rue, stood
against men's stomakes even like sour wine after that the people had once
tasted the new must of evangelical hertinesse. On this behalf they were
afearde lest their authority should abate, they feared decaying of their
gaynes, they feared lest their kingdom should have a fall. And as for the
thing which at that time befell according to the litterall discourse of the
story, the same does often times happen after the moral sense also,
whansoeuer, and as often as they which sit in the top castle or high chair
of religion, and which be persons notorious in the profession of teaching the
doctrine of holy scripture, do fall in conspiracy with the secular princes
against Jesus. It such a time great is the destruccyon that hangs over the
people. And this thing so cummeth to pass, as often as the authority of the
priests and of the doctoures or open professors of divinity, does flatter
the kings and monarchs of this world, and as often as the same doctors say,
Amen, to the wilful affeccions and appetites of the said worldely princes with
their authority, whereas their parts had been with wholesome and frank
monicyons to tell the princes of their faults, to restreygne and bridle the
power of the same, and when the monarchs again on their parties do with
their treasoures and possessions underprop the others, and make themselves as
buckelers for the perverse desires of the bisshops and the diuynes, that is to
wete, for their couetise, their ambicion, and their tirannie. And albeit
neither of these both does commonly love the others: yet by wicked collusyon
they diligently aid, and maintain either others forward to the suppressyng
and destruiyng of the truth of Gods word. And truly the pernicyons
conspiryng of such, causes more mischief and castyng away of men in the
world now, then the conspiracy of the bisshopes, scrybes, phariseys, and
headmen of the people, did at those days among the Jews.

The.xx. Chapter.

AN occasyon therefore is sought, that although their faynesse to put Christ
to death was ungodly, yet they might before men seem to do it of an earnest
zele and favor to righteousenesse. It befell therefore upon a certain day,
that as Jesus was ^eaching the people in the temple, and was still dylygently
repeating unto them the news gladsome, and to be wished for, of everlasting
salvation, the said high pryestes together with the scribes, the phariseis and
the chief men of the lattee being in a confederacy, did assemble together in
a clustre, to the end they might at leastwise by their authority bridle Jesus
from the teaching of his holy doctrine. They ^ould not condemn his wondrefull
acts to be naught, which he had in so great a noumber wrought in presence and
sigh^e of the people. They were not hable to confound his doctrine, forasmuch
as it was altogether consonaunt and agreeable with the law, and with the will of
God. Upon this ground therefore do they deuyse their slaundreous querell
against him, that this authority to be a teacher of the people, he had taken
upon him of himself, where he ought to have received it a^ their hands:
wherein their drift was none other, but either to take over unto themselves the
glory which was due unto God, or else thereupon to frame some surmuised
querelle of mouyng a sedicion to charge Christ withal, in that he called the
people together, and kept them about him without the public authority of the
princes. They go therefore altogether into the temple to Jesus, saying: If thy
will be that we also should believe in thee, tell us by what autorytie thou
dooest all thyssame that thou dooeste. Thou do baptize, Tell us by what
authority dooest thou these ^^^nges?
thou do preach, thou healest folks on the Sabbath days, thou reacheste
in the temple, thou gatherest disciples about thee, thou calleste people from
their home and business and kepeste them with thee. Thou art a man to us
unknown: and as for public authority or power haste thou none at all.
Therefore who is it that has given thee this authority? But Jesus veraye well
perceyuyng this questyon to have proceeded from a wi^ked thought in them, that
is to wete, of a purpose to lay some surmuised matier unto him, and not to
learn: went not about to teach them, but damped their malice with an other
question again, as if a body should drive out one nail with an other out of
a bourde. For they had had John the Baptiste in veraye great estimacion, and
had come very thick unto him, when he baptized. And he said: John also had
gathered disciples unto him, and he also preached to great multitudes of people
in soundrye places of the wilderness, The baptism of John was it from heaven
or of men?
and about ^^^ime Iordane, the kingdom of god to approach, he boldly and
frankely declared the damnable vices of all persons indifferently, and
provoked them to repentance. And yet had not John neither any autorytie given
him of the priests, the Phariseis and the chyefe men of the laytie: but he had
come forth out of the wilderness as a man but newly come up of late, being
enspired and sent of God according to the Prophecye of Esaie. But the question
of these headmen being put forth as a bayre to take him in a trippe, meant none
other conclusyo^ ne purpose, but this. In case Christ had answered thatsame
authority to had been given him of God, they would have accused him of
blasphemy, in that he being but a man, took upon him that he had familiare
talk or conuersacyon with God. And as for the bishops, the Phariseis, and
the scribes, he had had no such authority given him by them. It remained than
by the conclusyon of their argument, that the power which he took upon him
was sediciouse, and comen of the instinete of Satan. For they were veraye
stiff in this poyn^te, that all power and authority of God was by due
succession come unto them, and none others, and that nothing was devoutly or
godly executed, which were not executed and dooen by authority of them. And
yet all the while being b^ynded with hatred, they had no remembrance how they
had highly regarded John tofore doing things sembleable without any authority
of all of men, yea in so much that they would in any wise hold an argument
that John was the Messyas, saving that John wrought no miracles. And yet for
this behalf of working miracles, they ought so much the less to have iangled
for murmoured against Christ. No nor this point neither came not to their
mind, that God of long continuance before times had given this kind of
power, when he spoke by his prophets: The authority of the Prophets, they
received and allowed: but the thing foreshewed by the prophets, they would not
receive. The lord therefore being minded to defeacte the malicious policy,
and the loutishe false packyng of them, shaped them an answer in this
mannyer: Before that I make any answer unto your demand, I on my party
also will demand a certain questyon of you, which ye will be hable quickly
to despetche with a word. And as soon as ye shall have despetched that, than
will I make answer unto your question that ye now demand of me. Tell me
this: The baptysme that John minystred unto the people, whether was it from
heaven, or else from men? And by whose authority did he baptize, whether
receyuyng it from heaven by the power of God, or else receyuyng it at your
hands? The perverse conseyence of the Jews had at once a smelle and felyng of
this forked questyon: (which the sophisters call an horned question, because
that to whether of both parties a body shall make a direct answer, If we
say from heaven etc
he shall run on the sharp poyncte of the horn, that is to say, shall
incur inconuenyence and be taken in his answer.) If they had minded to
answer the veraye truth of the mattier, the words of the truth was a
plain and a ready tale to be spoken: but they smelle themselves to be laid
for by the same policy, and train, wherewith they laid a bayte for him.
Herupon go they to a wyly counsayll together among themselves. For none there
is a more busye piece of work, then the framyng of a countrefaycte matyer:
and commonly one fraud halethan other at his ^ayle, and one guyle draws an
other after him. Therefore they lay their heads together thus conferryng
among themselves: what answer shall we make to this doubtful questyon? If we
shall say, that John's autoritye came immediately from heaven, he will straight
way hitte us in the forehead with it, and will say: Why than believe ye him not?
Why than did ye not give credyte to him, when he testyfyed of me? He plainly
confessed himself to be inferyour to me, and unworthy to bear my shoes
after me. He openly confessed himself to be an earthly manne and to speak
earthelye things, and being a basse slender person to speak basse matiers,
and that I being issued from heaven was above all creatures. How do ye
receive his authority, as a thing procedyng from God, and do openly in the
face of the world find slaundreous cauillacyons at mine authority, of which
he gave plain testimony? That if on the other side, we shall auouche that
John did nothing by the autorytie of God, But if we say of men. etc.
but of an humayne spirit only, all the universal people will upon us with
stones, because it is a thing rooted in the hearts of them all full and whole,
that John was a Prophet, And they au^swered. etc.
and that he wroughte by the inspiracyon of God whateuer he wrought. They had
no care to answer truth, but to answer yt might best serve to their
purpose. So do false doctoures au^swer, not the thing that scripture teaches,
but taking such sense therout by their interpretacion, as makes to their
affeccions. In case they should have answered truth, their authority among
the people stood in great hasard, if they had answered false, they feared
their lives. They stood in great fear of men, whereas they cast of from the^
the fear of God. Whereupon they answered, that they could not tell. There was
none other hole but this alone left open for them to escape out at: Neither
tell I you, by what authority I do these things.
but when they had gotten such an evasion, they do all under one se^blably
deliver the lord from aunswering to their question. For he said unto the^:
Because ye find such euasions and sterting holes, and will not answer that ye
know well enoughe: nor I neither will not tell you, by what autoritye I do
these things which ye see: albeit ye are not ignoraunte of this thing
neither, which ye now demand.

The priests, the Phariseis, the Scribes, and the headmen of the laity being
thus confuted, the Lord by an by brought in a parable, which might lay
plainly before their iyes their incurable malice worthy of damnacio^, who
having been so many ways provoked of god to amendment, had ^tyll grown
evermore to wurse and wurse, rennyng in contempt of the law, striekyng the
Prophets, and puttyng them to death, and entendyng no less then afterward
to put to death the son of god also, being the extreme remedy of al
eiuils, Math. xxi. Mathe. ^ii. A certain man planted a vineyarde. etc.
yea and to put him afterward again to more affliccio^ in the Apostles and
martirs. The tenor of the paraple is this. A certain man (quod Jesus) planted
a vineyard, which he was singularly in love withal, doing all that might
possibly be done, that he might at length have some fruict of the same. For he
hedged it diligently round about, and builded a tower within it, for watching
and keeping of it, he dygged out a gutter to receive the wine when it were
pressed, and he set ferthermore a wine press in it. And when it was thus
well furnished with all things apperteynyng, he put it forth to the hands
of housebandemen, that they should do all requisite housebandry unto it, and
gather the fruicte thereof at time conueniente. This done, he takes a voyage
into a far country, and continued a great long season absent from home.
This same verayly is the vineyarde of the Lord Sabbath, which the same lord
transposed and removed out of Egypt, and set in the land of beheaste: he
hedged it about with the precinct of the law: he protected it with watching
and keeping of it his own self in proper person: he beautified it with a
goodly temple: he added moreover in it priests, judges, capitaynes, and
teachers: he omitted nothing that to the ordreing or dressing thereof might
appertain. And this vineyarde being thus furnyshed to the point deuyse, wha^
it had been a long season looked for, yt it should bring forth good grapes, did
yet nevertheless through the defaulte of the housebandemen bring forth wild
grapes. The lord all this while, who in deed is no where not present, yet
seemed unto them to be absente far of, because his conuersacyon was in
heaven. Therefore when it was a time due and seasonable for the people of Israel
at last to bring forth fruicte according for such the bountiful goodness of
God toward them: the master of the vineyarde sent a servant of his, that is
to say one prophet or an other, unto the housebandmen, that is, to the princes,
to the priests, and to the Scribes, (who were the bearers of all the swaigh and
stroke,) that they should render and yield unto him, part of such fruicte as
had grown up in the vineyarde. And they beat him and sent him away empti
The housebandemenne, who had tilled and used the vineyard to the behoufe of
themselfes, and not of the Lord, first pumbled the servant about the ears,
and beat him, and than thrust him out by the shoulders, and sent him home
again empty. For to whom of the Prophets has not cruelty been showed? But
so great was the Lords ientlenesse and patience, that although he were with an
act of great despy^e provoked to indignacyon, yet did he show none
extremity ne rigor toward the housebandmenne: but he sent an other
servant to assaye whether he could call them home again to do their
duty as beecomed them. But they handled the secounde messagyer with no more
ientlenesse ne favor then they had used the other before. For when they
had sore coyled him, and had reuyled him with much despyteous language, they
sent him also empty home to his Lord: empty (I say) of the fruicte which he
looked for, but laden with his back burden of wrong and of ill handleing. For
whither should they go, but to the Lord, who said? The redress be left to
me, and I shall acquit it. The patience of the Lord, though it were after
this extreme sort eftsoon encensed to wrath: yet did he not for all this
step furthe to do vengeance neither, but sent yet the third servant. And
him too did the housebandemen sore wound, and so send him home again to his
master empty. For the goodness of their Lord, which provoked them to
repentance, did ence^ce their malice, yea wurse then it was before. And though
al ye despite wherewith they had grievously handled the servants that were
sent, did of good cause touch the master that had sent them, and though
they ought now of good right to have been punished, which being so often
occasioned to goodness had evermore growe^ forward to heinous deeds of
mischief, every one act wurse then an other: yet did the Lord of his exceeding
great mercifulnes, make yet a ferther delay of his stroke and vengeance
therefore, as one that was more desirous to try the vttermoste remedy
possible, then to show or execute any rigor upon the housbandmen. And thus he
cast with himself in his mind. What may I do to bring these wieked
housbandemen of mine, to a better mind again, through whose defaute the
fruicte of my vineyarde does now of a long continuance perish unto me? I
have sent so many servants, it is not one whit the better emended. The thing
which only is yet behind, that will I do. I will send my dear son, etc.


I will send my only son, whom I love tendrely. They which set my
servants at naught, yet peradventure when they shall see my son, though
they will not love him, yet certes they will bear some reverence unto him, and
will wurshippe me my self in him. Naughty persons are woonte now and than at
leastwise for very shame, to be brydled from a deed of mischief which they
would else do. This devise therefore, that is, with the hasarding of his own
son to seek the saving and recovery of his housbandemen, lyked the most
merciful Lord, as a Lord being right desirous to save men, and most slow
to strieke. This is the heir, come leat us kill him.
The son being obedient to his father, went.

The housbandmen, when they saw the son, they did not only not reverence
him, but also with wieked stomakes turned themselves full and whole to the
devises, and purposes of most extreme madness, saying among themselves:
Hitherto have we shaken of the servants that have come to us, thissame is the
son and the heir who entendeth one day to avenge the despyte dooen by us
unto his father. Leatte us kylle him, and so shall we recover the enheritaunce
of this vineyarde for our own behoufes, stoutelye setting the Lord at
naught. This deiuelyshe deuyse was well lyked emonge them being confederate
altogether, and so they cast the son out of the vineyarde, and slew him.
When the Lord Jesus had with this process plainly showed to the pryestes, to
the Scribes, and to the chief rewlers, their very own conscience, who even
at that present hour with all their endeavor a^tempted the same that withyn a
little while afterward they committed in fact and deed, (leadyng Jesus
forth, and crucifying him without the city:) turnyng himself unto them
asked this questyon of them. The matier going thus, what shall the Lord of the
vineyarde do unto such housebandemenne? When they eftesones use their
euasions to avoid making of an answer, the Lord said moreover. The Lord
himself will come, and will send a shameful end to those housebandemenne,
who could not be woonne with any ientle favor, and those same persons
utterly destruied by death, he will set forth his vineyarde to other
housebandemen. By this saying did the Lord sygnyfie, that the religion of the
Jews, should even by the root be abolished, and the fruicte of the gospel
be transposed and removed unto the Gentiles by the ministry of the Apostles.

But the Phariseis (as men that could in no wise away with the hearing of
this) answered: God forbydde, it shall not be so. For they well perceived all
this parable to had been told against them: and where they could very well
away with the deiulishe purpose and deuyse to kill Jesus, yet do they utterly
deteste and abhor the just vengeance of God due for such a wyeked purpose.
But Jesus purposelye to show that the veraye same thing which they denied had
been foresayed of the Prophets, that it would so fortune, cast an earnest iye
upon them, and (as ye would say) speaking unto their conscience, The stone
that the builders refused. etc.
said: If ye give not credit to my parable, what is it than that ye read in
the Psalms? That same stone which the builders cast aside and would none of,
is become the head stone of the corner: whosoever shall light on that stone to
stumble on it, shall be all to crushed, and again on whom the same stone shall
fall him shall it grynde to poudre. Christ sygnifyethe himself to be the
celestial stone, sent of god, whom the Jews refused, building up their
Synagogue without Christ: but God made him the corner stone which knitteth
together and closethe up both the walls into one, and coupleth two soondrye
peoples into one church and congregation through evangelical faith without
the ceremonies of the law. And this stone is a most sure buckeler and defense
against all the assaults of the world and of Satan unto all such, as
beleuyng on him, do cleue fast unto him, and do rest or staygh on him.

But he is sound and irresistable unto such as will rebel against him. For
none there is so great a power of this world, but that it is al to crusshed if
it stumble on this stone. And certes stumble he does at him, whosoever
resists him and casts him of. Now on the other side, drieuen to ponder
shall that person be, on whom that stone shall light in his falling. And
certes on such does it light, whom after they have been a great long time
suffered, the stroke of God at last falls sodaynlye upon, ere they be aware
or think on it. For one and the same stone, is life to those that rest
thereon, and damnacion to such as are enemies unto it. These parables of the
Lords declaring, set the hearts of the headmen, of the priests, and of the
Scribes in such an eagre rage, that they were minded even there presentelye to
have laid hands on him, but the dread of the people did at that time streygne
them from that wieked vilannie, among whom they saw Jesus to be had in very
great price. For knowing themselves naught in their own conscience, they had
smelled the parable which was told, to touch and hitte them as right as
any thing, and yet had the parable been told to such intent as they might
by the understanding thereof be called back again from their most deiulishe
purpose which they had intended. But now are they made the more crabbed and
fierce unto doing of mischief, by the selfsame thing, where by they ought to
have been clean discouraged and drieuen from their malice.

Therefore being now departed, (by reason of standing in dread of the people)
from doing the heinous act in the open face of the world, which in their
eiuill hearts they had already dooen, after they had once so determined: they
go about the bringing of it to effect by privy trains of undermining him:
being even somuche the more ungracious, that they join fraud unto their
malice: like as a more mischievous creature is he that sleagheth prieuely with
poison, then one that kills with a sweorde. Now hear thou, o Theophilus, the
wiles and traynes of the wicked priests, whose desire was for this cause to
have Jesus for ever destruied, that is to say, to have the truth evangelical
utterly oppressed, because that by the same verity of the gospel was taken
away from them the farming of the vineyarde, the propre owning and possession
whereof they had promised unto themselves both perpetual forever, and also to
come to them by title and succession of enheritaunce. They hide their anger
showing no manier countenance thereof, They sent forth spies which should
feign the^ selves righteous men etc.
and watch all occasions possible to put him to death. They colourably send
forth certain counterfeict persons, who should feign theimselfes to be just
and righteous before God (and nothing is there in the world more pestilent or
deadly then is counterfeict righteousness) to the end they should out of his
words hunt out one poinct or other, whereof he might be detected before the
Emperor of Romes deputies, and before the lieutenaunt Pilate, who at that
present season was the high rewier in Iewry in Ceasars behalf: and this did
they, to thentent and purpose that all the grutche, and querele of this fact
might be laid over from themselves to the others, as though he had been
put to death by the sentence and judgment of Ceasars officers, and that
they on their parties as men vnculpable might appear to have kept their hands
from effusion of blood. But the more they go about by worldelye subtlety to
hyde it, so much do they more and more notoriously bewray their incomparable
malice. The said disguisyng maskyng esquiers therefore of the bishops do
set upon Jesus, and assail him with such kind of words as here ensue.
Master we know that thou say and teacheste right. etc.
Master we have throughlye seen thy perfect vpryghtenesse: thou tellest thy
mind plainly without any fear or dissimulacyon, and teach every thing
after the right sort, neither is there with thee any such respect or
accepcion of persons, that thou will tell me a lie for the favor of any
man, be he of never so much power and authority: but thou have evermore
only God and none else before thine iyes. What is acceptable to him and
standing with his pleasure, the same dooest thou plainly and without any fear
teach. Teil thou unto us therefore what thy very opinyon and mind is in a
mattier about which there is much controversy and variaunce among no small
noumber of us: whether is it a thing standing with gods pleasure and
contentacion, Is it lawefull for us to give tribute unto Ceasar?
that we give tribute unto Ceasar, or is it not? Jesus than who had a perfeict
understanding of these smoothe and sweet honey words mening fraud and
deceipte toward him, and knowing veraye well to what end this snareful
bayted question was meant, which was, that in case he had answered according
as their very hope was he would, that it were not standing with Gods
contentacyon that a people being consecrated unto God, should be in
subieccyon, and should pay tribute to an ungodly prince and an ydolatre,
(which opinyon the Pharisees allowed, though they durst not openly speak
it:) they would eftesones have procured and addressed out some counterfeicte
persons, which should have detected him of high treason before Pilate
(being the emperors lieutenaunte:) he did by euangelycall policye in such
wise defeat their maliciouse deceiptefulnesse, that he did both take away
from them the occasyon which was sought to do him harm, and also put them
in remembrance what their duty was to do, which thing undoubtedly no man
should leave undone without assured peril and ieopardye of his life. For
Christ was not come for any such purpose, as to teach how much was to be
paid unto Emperoures, or to Emperoures deputies: but what was due of the
spiritual substance to be paid unto god, who is the Lord of all things.
Why come ye to tempt me (says he?)* Show me a piece of your silver coin.
For he knows not the image of Ceasar, forasmuch as he had nothing in earth.
When the piece of coin was showed him in his hand, he demanded whose
phisyonomye it was, Give unto Ceasar the things which belong unto Ceasar.
and whose title or poysee was written about it. For this is a thing too, that
a true Christian does not know. But they who knew it (that is men wedded to
the world) said: Ceasars phisionomye and pryente it is.

Than quod Jesus byanby: than render and pay ye unto Ceasar, if any thing
belongs to his right. For I force nothing what the princes of this world
do require by their exaccions. But this is yet a greater poyncte of your
charge, and more requisite to the purpose, that ye tender unto God, that ye
oughe unto him: know ye therefore the image of him stricken and coined in your
hertes, acknowelage ye his title and poisee. All the soul is due to him every
whit of it, and ought not to be in bondage to any other person, then to him,
who created both the body and ye soul too. And bearing (as it does) the
image of God, wherefore is it paid for tribute to the deiuill? The subtle
awaiters to have taken him in a trippe, marvel at so wary and circumspect an
answer. For the euangelical simplicity has a politic cast of it own too.
Yet this notwithstanding, they would not acknowelage the heavenly wisdom of
God in him, but sorowed because there was nothing which they could reprove in
all his talk.

When the said parties were departed from him, there came unto him of the
sect of the Sadducees, who under a false title of righteousness made much
high solemnity of theimselfes, in like manier as the Phariseis had their name
of excellency in outward appearance to the sight of men, wherein they
thought theimselfes far to surmounte and pass the other sects.

And the sect of the Sadducees has this one propre^ie by theimselfes, The
Sadducees, deny yt there is any resurreccion
that they do not believe any arisyng again of the bodies to be after this
life, neither any part of man to remain after death, ne that there be any
Angels. These Sadducees propoune to the Lord such a question as follows.
Master, such manier a law has there been given to us by Moses, that in case
any man, after he has married a wife, shall be deceassed without children: the
brother of the party so deceassed, shall marye the wedowe leaft by him: and
succedyng in the place of his brother, shall reise succession and issue unto his
brother of the same woman's body. So than it fortuned, that there were seven
brethren of whom the first married a wife, and died without issue. The next
eldest brother took her that was leaft to wife, and dyed himself likewise
having had no children by her. Next after him succeeded the third brother into
wedlock, according to the course of his age, who on his party also dyed
without children. And short tale to make, in semblable manier was this woman
married unto every one of them until the seventh, and al had her, and yet made
she never an one of them a father, ne brought him forth any child. In process
of time dyed the woman too. Now than at the general resurreccion, which of the
seven brethren shall recover the possession of this woman to his wife? For ons
married she was to every one of them, and she can not be common to them al,
ne to any mo housebandes then one. By this toye having in it neither time nor
reason, the Sadducees supposed that the opinion of the Phariseis might be
wyped clean away, which Phariseis did stiefflye hold argument, that the
souls do remain after the bodies be dead, yea and ferthermore that the
bodies of the dead shall one day return to life again.

Now because these men's apposyng of him contained in it more foolishenesse,
the^ malice, Jesus vouchesalued to enstructe the^, saying: ye are in a wrong
opinion in that ye imagyne the like state of things to be in the life to
come, as ye see in this present world here. The children of this world, which
world is never without successiue alteracion of some diyng every day, and
othersome daily cummyng into the world, do remediless seek out and procure
wives for their sons, and do set out their daughters in marriage to
houseba^des, for mankind cannot by any other possible means be continued in
progeneracion of issue. And therefore matrimony among them is not a thing of
blissefulnesse, but of necessity. But those persons to whose lotte such
bliss shall fall, that they may be reputed worthy the resurreccion of the
just, and worthy thatsame world, which knows no mortality, such neither
shall procure wives for their soonnes, nor shall give their daughters to
housebandes in marriage. For what need shall there be of marriage or a carnal
copulacion, when no body shall now dye? For they have now already
succeassed any longer to be carnal, and to be subject to the incommodityes
of this world, but have now received a body that shall never dye, and shall
now from henceforth none otherwise live then the Angels do live, among
whom there is no marriage ne use of wedlock because there is no necessity of
dying.

Here in this world they that of mortal parents are borne mortal, do by
the use of matrimonye, make provision and means for continuing the succession
of mankind: But those others being now by the virtue of the spyrite new
borne again, and made the sons of God living for ever without end, shall
feel no miss of matrimony, because they shall not know death, as being now
through resurreccion restored unto life immortal. And because thissame
doubtefull question had been propouned of the Sadducees purposely to mock
the arisyng again of the dead, because they believed not that the souls do
remain alive after the death of the body: Jesus vouchesalued to enstructe
their ignorant hertes concerning this case too, by autoritye of holy
scripture, which holy scripture in deed they did not disalowe, but yet they
did read the same not having their minds on it to mark it as they should
do. Ueraily (says he) to be a thing possible enough, that ye dead may arise
again, and that the souls do not dye together with the bodies, even Moses
himself does teach you to be true, whose authority, forasmuch as ye do
in other matters acknowlage, ye ought not in this case to reiecte. For Moses
has written, that God spoke unto him after this manier out of the bushe,
which he had seen in read flaming fire to burn without any consumyng or
wastyng. I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the
God of Jacob. etc. Now were Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, at that time already
buiried in grave: That if according to your opinion, every one which dies,
dies for altogether, and dies never to be recovered again: how does god call
himself god of them that be none such? For seeing that God is ye very true
living god himself, or rather (more truly to speak) is very life self: it
is a thing vnconueniente, that he should call him self the God of such as by
mean of death are utterly perished and gonne for ever. But they are not so
gone, For he is not a god of dead but of living.
forasmuch as the chieffer part of them remains alive, that is to were, the
soul, being the part whereby our life is in us. In other living creatures
besides man, death is an vttre perishing for ever: for in them as well the
body falls altogether down as soon as it is destitute of life, as also the
soul, which in them is naught else but a certain harmonye, and proporcionate
agreyng together of the qualites and humors of the body, which as soon as
thatsame temperature is dissolved, vanishes away immediately as a thing of
nothing. But in man death is nothing else, but a pluckyng of the soul in
soondre from the body, so that the better part of the two that are in us
remains still uncorrupted, and the body only is for a season not vttrely
perished neither, but as ye would say, putrified. And the same body to be
restored again by the power of god at the resurreccion, ought not to seem any
meruaill unto you, forasmuch as ye daily see of a dry grain of sede cast
away into the earth, and there putrified, a new and a live tree to spryng up,
which lay hydden in a little small and dead self grain now buiried in the
ground. Therefore such as are dead, to you ward are dead in deed, forasmuch
as ye are not hable to revive them again: but every one of them, yea even
they that are dead also do live to godwarde, in whose hand it is,
whansoeuer his will shall be, to restore the souls that have been plucked
away, every one to their own bodies again. When the Sadducees at these
sayings held their peace not having a word to speak: certain Scrybes
allowed the talk of Jesus, because that concerning this case, the Pharyseis
and the Scribes did consent in opinion against the sect of the Sadducees.
Notwithstanding like as the opinion of the Phariseis and Scrybes was in this
behalf righter then the opinion of the Sadducees: so were their hertes more
replete with mischief and ungraciousness. For in such a place does there
less part of malice remayn, where there rests more of gross ignorance and
defaulte of learning. And after ye durst they not ask hi^ any question at all.
Thus after that Jesus had in vain been tempted and proved of soondrye sects
of the Jews, (for he had before this time answered the Phariseis to their
question concerning the greateste precepte of the law,) and not one of them al
had had such speed as he would in that y^ he had attempted: no man durst
adventure any more to be buisie or to begin with him in demaundyng of any
questions.

Jesus therefore of his own mocion when they were gathered together in a p^u^pe,
did bid them answer him who would, to a question that he would demand, not
being a question full of baits to take them in trippes, but a question that
concerned their soul health. He demanded whose son the scripture did
pronounce that Messiah should be* They being not ignorant that it had by
prophecy been foresaied, that Messiah should in time cummyng be borne of the
lineage of David, made answer without any stoppes or staighes: David's son. To
this Jesus said: But David being enspired with the holy ghost, Psalm. cx.
speaks of Messiah after this manier in the Psalms: The Lord said unto my
Lord, sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy foot
stool. How agrees it, that David* should call him Lord whom he
acknowelageth and takes for his son? For the son is inferior to the
father: and more reason it were, that the soonne should in the way of honor
and reverence call the father Lord, then contrary wise. This question could
not one of them all soil, and for that present Jesus thought it sufficient
(as ye would say) by a mystical ^iedell to have given them a little
intimacion or inclyng of his nature of Godhed, by the which nature of his
Godhed he was superior unto all the Patria^kes, forasmuch as he was egual unto
God the father, albeit even after his humain nature also he excelled all
creatures. And they reputed the memory of David to be holy and precious: but
him whom David acknowelaged both for his soonne, and also for his Lord: him
they cast of, not through ignorance of the law, but of a judgment being
blinded with perverse and corrupt affeccions.

Forasmuch therefore as the malice of this generation was past al hope of
grace, and not curable by any salues that could be: it remained, that the
simple and unlettered multitude of the people should have good warning given
them that they might not be trained in and deceived by coulouring and crafty
conueighaunce of the others, who whereas they were void of al religion or true
devotion, yet did they countrefeicte the highest godliness possible, having
iye to none other mark, but only to their own glory and lucre, and for that
same only cause murmouryng and pratyng all manier ways possible, against the
glory of God, and against the health of their neighbors. For there be none
more deadlye enemies of true godliness, He said unto his disciples
then such as by countrefaictyng of holy conuersacio^ purchase unto
theimselfes authority, and bearing theimselfes bold on the same, do withdraw
the simple people from true godliness. This kind of maskers are fore taken
with two diseases in especial, that is, with ambicion which altogether
enclineth to tyranny, and with couetise insaciable. And such men did Jesus (as
it were) plainly peince out unto his disciples, and that did he all the people
being within audience of it, to the end the said Phariseis and Scribes might
be shunned, forasmuch as they would not be reformed: and that they might
have no longer time to deceive, seeing they would in no wise emend. And this was
not any such poyn^t as to backebite or take away any men's good name and
fame, but to make a good sure way for the safegarde and preseruyng of the
simple innocent people. Now listen thou sweet Theophilus, with what colors the
Lord pe^neteth them out, yt thou mayeste eschew them, when they be known
unto thee. Beware ye of the Scribes (says he) such as ye do now often
times see to assail me with guyle and subtlety. They profess the perfeict
knowlage of the law, and do obstinatelye resist the mind of the law. They
have God in their mouth, but they are open adversaries to the glory of God.
They proteste in words, to be earneste trauaillers for the peoples behoufe
and profit, whereas they cou^trefaict al things that ever they do for
respect of their own commodities. Th^^ make great fleeyng outwardly from the
coumpaignie of sinners, yea, and in case they light on the coumpaignie of such
by any casual chance, they purge theimselfes by much washynges: but
theimselfes on their own parties do withinfoorth altogether swymme in vices
much more detestable, that is to we^e, in desire of vainglory, in high
solemnity of look and countenance and in envy, but most specially of all in
auirice, which to do is no less then plain wurshyppyng of idolles. And
because they understand and perceive the people to be must chiefly moved with
such things as may be seen with the bodily iyes: they do with such kinds
of iugleynges, And love gretinges in the marketies.
hunt and seek to geat authority among the simple souls. They do (as ye would
say) set out themselfes to sale, by their newefound disguised vesture,
having a great pride and felicity to be ie^tyng up and down where they may
be seen in their autentical robes of auncyentenesse reachyng down to the hard
ground: and with their countenaunces framed to a gravity, they are often and
much present in ye high streets and in places of great resort of people, to
the intent they may there have much crouchyng and doukyng made unto them, and
that they may be hailled and greted by the name of wurshypfull masters. In
the sinagoges also and in places where much coumpaignie is sitting together,
they look and seek to have the highest seats, and at feasts when they shall
sit down to meat, they have a great appetite to begin the table, because
they would seem great and iolye fellows in the eyes of men, whereas before the
face of God they are accursed and detestable. And yet might they seem to be
no more but vainglorious and foolyshe, Which devour wedowes houses feining long
prayers.
if they made no ferther sekyng nor suyng but for the swifte blastes of bruit
and fame of ye people, and the vanishing smoke of haillinges and gretynges.
Nay, there is nothing more full of catchyng and pollyng then they are. They
occupy not the trade of vsurye, lending out their money for encresse or
gains: they are not collectours ne receivers of tribute whereby to polle and
piele the common people, but they have castes and sleightes more ungracious
then the craftye trade of such is. The simpler sort of people which may
easily be beguyled, do they hunt to take for a pray: they seek to catch
wedowes such as are welthye and rich, and destitute of the aid of
housebandes, which might defend them. The sex of womankynde is apt to be
deceived by fraud, and a godly act it is in appearance, to be helpers of
such as are destitute. Such simple wedowes therefore do they easily flock
and lou^e, through countrefaictyng of holiness. Ueraye much gravity do they
pretend in their countenance, they be honored of every body, their very
habyte does on every side cry them to be men of holy conversation, and
they use besides this to be a long while together in prayers, yea and that
shall be done in the open streets where every body may bear record.
The Same thing was dooen of John also and of the old ancient prophets, but it
was dooen in secret, where none might behold it but God. But these fellows
do not pray, but hunte. What meruayl tha^, if selie wedowes be deceived by
so many ways of coulourable delyng? But when they have ons crepte in, to
geate their heads within the said wedowes doors, they devour their houses,
and piele and polle the sely weomen whom their parts had been to defend and
save, and what ought to have been g^ue^ out in alms to the behouf of the
poor, that do they wholly convert to their own lucre. Such manier men were
the Scribes at those days and the Phariseis, who without end both in word
and deed, made resiste^ce against the gospel. Albeit there be even at this
present day too, and ever will be Scribes: who while they set al their mind
and study upon their own profits, do not only both speak and work
against the commodities of the people, but also be resist the glory of Jesus,
and that they do under a false pretense of religion, by their wedes, by their
titles, and by their long prayers, huntyng for to geat an opinion of holiness
in the sight of the common people: which common people does not yet well
understand in what things true religion does consiste. But now, what shall
the disciples of Christ do against such Scribes and Phariseis, forasmuch
as ye true disciples of Christ can no manier skyl of harmyng any body as me^
indewed with the simpleness of very doves. Forsooth they shall in this case
use also the subtlety of the serpent. If being duly told of their ill
doings they do not emend, their coumpaignie must be shunned, seeing they are
incurable, and the simple are to be warned that they beware of the same sect
liyng in awaite for them, And as for the said Scribes and Phariseis, their
due punishemente abides them. For when they shall come to the seat of
judgment, before thatsame judge, who judges not by such things as are seen
with the iyes of the body, but by the priuye affeccions of the hertes: at that
hour shall such be adjudged to more grievous torments, The same shall receive
greater damnacion
then those, which are to ye open sight of the world and unfeignedly full of
heinous enormities being persons so much the less culpable, because they
show their disease openly and hide it not.

The.xxi. Chapter.

ANd to the entente the Lord Jesus would the more diepelye enpriente the
foresaied matter in the hertes of the people, which was, that men are not
esteemed in ye sight of God by things visible but by sincerity of ye heart,
and also might check the couetise of the Scribes, of ye Phariseis, and of the
priests, who brought the people in an earneste belief, and in especial selie
fond weomen that were wedowes, (if they were welthie and rich, or else not,)
that it was the higheste poynete of holiness that could be, if they did
contribute a verai great portion of their best substance into the corbone*
that is, their church treasury of Jewels and offreynges, the poverty in the
mean while ouerpassed, yea and many times their children and parents too: as
he was sitting in the ^emple, he cast up his iyes unto thatsame place, which
is called Eazophilacium (that is to say) the Iewelhouse or ^extrye, or
treasourie, in the which the Jewels of the temple were kept. The priests
would in any wise have this money reputed so holy, that where the law had
specially commanded that the parents should be honored, their doctrine was,
that the father ought rather to be least vnholpen, the^ ye corbon not to be
increased, whereas that money yet nevertheless through the default and abusion
of the priests, was now already a great part of it turned to the
mainteinaunce of the sensual excessive living of the same priests only. So
when many rich and welthie persons had cast many things into the
treasourie, and had much countenance and signs of allowing them for casting
in such money made unto them by the priests and Phariseis, He saw al so a
certain poor wedow, which cast in thither two mites.
as Gods creatures for their so dooyng: there came thither a certain selie
poor wedowe who cast in two mytes or littell brass pens of money, as much
as came to a ferthyng. And when no yearthly creature at all would once make any
sign of commendyng her, because she gave but a littel: yet was it Jesus
pleasure that the godly devotion of this woman should be known to the people.
For he said: This wedowe seems by the judgment of men to have put a
veraye small porcio^ into the treasourie, but the same woman by ye judgment of
God, has cast in more then those other rich persons, which have veraye
largelye dooen. This poor wedowe has put in more then they all.
For they are liberal of the superfluity which they have at home: but this
poor wedowe upon an earneste zele and devotion of dooyng her duetye unto God,
has given of her penury, whereas she had full great need to have kept it
still, and all the substance which she had at home, she has now cast into
the treasourie. In the sight of God therefore, who has not an iye to the
quantity of the thing, but to the heart of the geuer, she gave a more
bou^teous offreyng, then the others which gave a great dele more in
quantity. Thus Jesus by every occasion withdrewe his disciples from puttyng
affiaunce or trust in things that may be seen (whereunto the Jews did
attribute over much) unto ye earnest exercise of evangelical devotion and
godliness, which consists in the sincere affeccion of the heart.

Now so it was, that the Jews had an especial glory in their temple of
Jerusalem, the which because it was excedyng curiously builded, and also
enriched with many high and precious Jewels, was visited with great religion,
not only of all the Jews, but also of aliens and men of other strange
nations. And now was the time come, that the religion of the same material
temple with the sacrifices and oblacions to the same belongyng should cease,
and the temple of man's heart being consecrated with the holy ghost should be
prepared for God, in which there should most acceptable sacrifices be daily
offered unto him, not of brute beasts, but of godly prayers, and thanks
geuyng. For the pure heart, yea even of every poor body, is a more portelye
and gorgeous temple to God, then was the said most sumpteous temple of
Jerusalem, which had been so many years in edifiyng. Chastity, humility, and
charity or per^^^c^e love toward al men, been ornaments a great deal more
precious in ye sight of God, then that other marble pillours, the garnishing of
yuerye, the tymbrewoorke of cedret^e, the gold, the silver, and the precious
stones, whereof the priests and Phariseis made so much great pride and
show. And so, when certain persons made a poynctyng and a showing to Jesus,
toward the woondrefull buildyng of the temple, which was edified with the
most pure stone that could be, and the same stone both poolished and keruen
with great woorkmanship of masonrie, and was ferther more with many Jewels
gaie and richely beseen, he answered: prepaire ye unto God a ghostlye temple,
which neither oldnesse may eat up with rottyng, neither any te^peste may
overthrow, nor fire may burn up, There shall not be leaft one stone upon an
other
ne any power of man may destru^e or cast down: For the time shall shortly
come when all these things which ye do now make so much meruailyng and
gazyng at, as things worthy and mete for God, shall be thrown down even to
the foundation, yea in so much, that there shall not so much as one stone be
left standing upon an other, but that it shall be destruied. The disciples
this hearing, and co^iecturyng even of those very words, that the kingdom of
heaven was now not far of, which kingdom they supposed and imagined should
come with a great change and turning vpsyde down of the world: being gredye
men to know the time when these things should come, do say unto the Lord:
Master, al thissame that thou speak of castyng down of the temple, and of
the vttre destruyng of the city of Jerusalem, what day or when shall it
cumme to pass, or by what sign may we be hable to know the said time to
be already come? But Jesus whose will is to have his disciples evermore in a
readiness against all assaults of eiuyll mysauentures, did by his doubtful
and entrieked communicacion, set their minds in suspense and perplexity,
making a medley of many soondrye matters together, concerning affliccions which
they should afterward abide for preaching the ghospel, concerning the beatyng
down and the miserable plague of the city of Jerusalem, and concerning the
end of the world, the hour and time whereof it was his pleasure to have
unknown to all creatures, to the intent they should continually evermore be in
a readiness. The disciples minds ran altogether upon a kingdom: But the
Lord was more willing to have them know the thing that did more nerelye
touch them, and to know those other matters the very speaking and mencionyng
whereof, their hertes vttrely abhorred, because they were as yet but weak and
fraill men. For they had better fancy and will to hear words pleasant to
the ear of worldelye coumforte and solace, then to hear things concerning
the coumforte of the soul health. The foresaied blessed reign will one day
surely come, and at his due time will it come, but the care and charge thereof,
it is most expediente to put in the hands of God, and to leat him alone
withal, our parts it is in the mean time so to behave our selves, that we
may not seem unworthy of that kingdom. For there is no cummyng to the glory
of the same reign, but by mean of soondrye affliccions. Se that ye be not
deceived.
Against such affliccions it behooves our hertes to be well armed: Jesus
therefore said: Out of all doubts come I will, and displeigh the majesty of
the reign Evangelical. But see ye y^ ye be not seduced, enbracing an other
Christ instead of me: For before the prefixed time at which I will come, For
many shall come i^ my name, and say yt they are christ.
there will come many which will usurp my name unto them, and will boldly
auouche of themselfes and say: I am Christ. The time is at hand: Be not ye
any thing moved with the words of such: and in case they shall call you any
whether, go not ye after them. Ueraily when ye shall hear all the world to
be in a garboile of sedicio^s and of wars, many persons shall play the
prophets, and shall allege the end of the world to approach. But be not ye
any thing feared with such rumors, as though the last day be even than
byanby at hand. For in deed such things as these shall fortune, but the end
of the world comes not even straight way in the neck thereof. For these
shall be nothing else but certain preau^bles of the said extreme distress
which shall be to the eiuil sort an vttre castyng away, and to the good it
shall be an examinacion or trial, and a purif^yng of them. As when the body is
toward the poyncte of diyng the signs and tokens thereof be strong diseases
having come up and grown in the same bodies, through an unnatural
diste^perature of the humors, so shall these terrible co^mocio^s and
hurleyburley foreshew ye end of ye world, which hurleyburley ma^ns self does
procure unto himself by reason that he is infected with inordinate lusts and
affeccions. Through man's peruersenes shall ye very nature of things be shaken
out of al due order and course, detestyng (as it were) the malice of man, and
strongly ensourgeyng for the redress and aue^gemente of their vngra^^^usnesse.
Nation shall arise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
With great vproares and garboile shall there be arisinges of nation against
nation and royalme against royalme. And whereas there is nothing more
distresseful the^ war, yet does man purchase and wilfully procure this
pernicious confusion unto himself through a^bicion, through folly, through
couetise, through hatred, and through other like corrupt affeccions. Yea and
verai nature self shall over and besides ye premises, cause many sore
yearthquakes in many soondrye places, in sort as though ye world took high
skorne and disdeigne, for that it were forced to bear men being such ungodly
and wicked creatures. There shall morouer cum great pestile^ces which by their
infeccion shall waste away and consume a mighty great nou^bre of people in
sort as though the air were armed and weaponed to do vengeance upon the
civil sort, whereas it was for this purpose first ordained and set for man's
use, that with it wholesome breath it should both give and nourish life unto al
creatures Ferthermore through penury of the fruits of ye earth there shall
come fami^ne, in case as if the earth should say that she would not give food
unto her children being so wicked agaysnt God, And great signs shall there be
from heaven.
to whom eue^ the dumme elements also do their bounden service and duty.
The sea also shall be thoroughly moved with strange and unwont rages of
tumbleyng and tossing whereas the same too had aforetymes been accustomed to
serve to the use of man. Yea and besides all ye premises, the very sky and
heaven shall show woondreful signs testifiyng the wrath of God. For the sun
shall be turned to derkenesse, the moon into (...), blasyng sterres shall in
strange likeness show theimselfes and other unnatural woonders shall appear
being uncouth and worthy to be meruayled (...). But like as a man's body*
does not straight way pass out of the world wha^ it is strieken with extreme
great sickenesses, and yet nevertheless the same or (...) like diseases ever now
and than cummyng unto him and taking him again, (...) declare that the time of
his death is not far of: right so when the world (...) with such manier eiuils,
as aforesaied, be ratleed an shaken together, yesame evils shall give a great
significacion and tokening of the world drouping now apa^^ toward his last
date, and fast growyng toward decay and ruin.

But ere thissame woeful distress shall thus cease upon all the world at
once, there shall excedyng great perverseness of men come before, which shall
provoke the goodness of god to wrath. For when ye shall preach my name
through which they may be saved, they shall lay hands upon you, and shall
persecute you with all kind of dooyng ill or mischief unto you, they shall hale
you and pull you unto their counsel houses of assembly, as though ye were
culpable and malefactors. They shall ferthermore cast you in prieson: they shall
a^taine, and condemn you at the benches of kings and rewlers, not for any
your transgression, but for your great and high well dooyng, that is to wete,
for the professing of my name, which name of mine they shall labor by all
means and ways to abolishe, where they might by the same freely atteigne
everlasting salvation. And this shall chance unto you, that your conscience
may be approved, and also that their malice may well be perceived to be
justly condemned. For a testimonial.
But as for you boldly trustyng on my sure defense, and your own innocence,
there is no cause why ye should fear the judgment seats, ne yet why ye
should carefully devise or record with your selfs, how ye being as ye are, men
of no knowlage shall plead your own cause in ye consistory or court of
estates and princes. Neither is there any cause why for you to bring in any
rhetorycian, patron, or man of law, to be your attorney. I mine own self
will as an invincible patron and advocate stand by you through my spirit,
who shall ministre unto you, both toungue and wisdom, such as all your
adversaries shall not be of power to resist ne to gaynsaye, be they never so
cruel or eloquent and well spoken in worldely wisdom

And all thissame shall ye suffer not only at the hands of men unknown and of
strangers, but also at the hands of them which are knitte and joined unto
you in nerenesse of blood, and with the straight bands of frendeshippe. The
father shall persecute the son: the brother shall wrappe the brother in
affliccion: the cousyn shall appeache and accuse the cousyn, one friend shall
bring an other into the law. Yea and some there shall be of you whom they
shall for hatred of me pursue unto death, and shall slay you. So eagre and
grievous hatred shall all the whole world conceive against you for the
profession of my name. And therefore whatsoever thing they shall entreprise to
do against you, the same will I take as dooen in despite of me: wherefore there
is nothing for you to think or devise of auengeyng your wrongs.

It is I that shall have displeasure dooen me, it is I that shall be slain in
you. It shall be my deed both to provide well enough for you, and also to take
vengeance on their malice. And though that storms of persecucion at the
hands of men shall never somuche feed and satisfy their cruelnesse against
you, there is no cause why for you to fear, the case so standing, that I am
your protector and defendour. And there shall not one hear of your head
perish.
For I will not so do, that any one hear of your head shall perish, much
less will I leave you in the briers destitute of my succoure. Neither have ye
any iye to worldelye assurance or defense, armies, weapon, engiens: by your
only sufferaunce shall ye defend your lives. Myscarrye be can not, that is
slain for the profession of my name. Ye shall not peryshe before your day. For
I will not give unto the violence of men so much of their own will. Yea and
such an one shall in veraye true deed have saved his soul, whosoever shall
constauntely take death for my cause.

As for this same rich and welthye city, of which the Jews at this present
take an high pride, and in which they think theymselfes to be kings
fellows: shall be even from the foundation destruied by the Gentiles.

Therefore when ye shall see Jerusalem to be round about besette with siege,
than understand ye the plain destruction thereof to be at hand, and that
there is no more to be done, but for every body to save theymselues by spedie
fleyng awa^e. For every body most commonly uses in wars to flatre
himself with the hope of victory. But beware ye that this hope beguyle none
of you: but whosoever shall at that time be in the marches of Iewrye: leate him
privily steal away and conueigh him self into the mountains and desert
places where no way ne path lies. And such folks as shall then be
enhabited in the very heart of Iewrye, leate them remove their dwelling to
some other place. And whomesoeuer of them, this extreme distress shall
soodaynlye take in any foreign countries or regyons, leate not such recule
into Iewrye, leate them esteem all things as clean forsaken, and no more a do
but every man save his own life. For these things shall not come to pass
through casual commocions of mortal men, For these are days of vengeance.
but the vengeance of god having been now a long time provoked through the
obstinate malice of man, shall by the instrumente of other foreign nations,
scourge and plague this nation being now many a long day a continual rebeller
against God. And that all this shall come to pass, the prophets have many
hundred years sens prophesied, and especially Daniell. Daui. xix.^
And avoided or chosen can it not be but that it must come to pass,
whatsoever thing ye scripture has foreshewed shall fortune. For Scripture never
failleth, as being a thing written by the enstincte of the spirit of God. And
yet shall not woeful extremity therefore chance, because the prophets have
prophesied that so it shall be, but it has therefore been prophesied,
because god foresawe the obstinate wickedness of man, which would afterward
provoke the vengeance of god to light upon it. And surely it shall be no less
than an huge storm of evils because a long and an obstinate ma^^^iousnesse of
this nation has gone before, which nation having been so many ways provoked to
emendemente, has nevertheless continuallye proceeded forewarde to wurse and
wurse.

But woe unto them that be with child, and to them that give such in those
days: for there shall be great trouble in the land, and wrath over all this
people. And they shall fall through the edge of the sweorde, and shall be led
away captive into al nations. And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the
Gentiles, until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Now this tempeste
shall enwrap al sorts of people together, as well the offenders as the
innocents. But somewhat the less unhappy shall they be whom the said
storm of all these mysauentures, when it grows fast upon the world, shall
find pressed and ready appoyncted to flee. But woe unto women with child, and
geuers of suck: because the same being charged with a burden which neither by
their good wills they would, nor though they would, they shall be hable to lay
down from them, shall not be light enough to run away. Neither shall there
be any hope of escapyng harmless, saving only in fleeyng. For there shall be
great trouble in ye land.
For it shall not be an affliccion or plague of the common rate: but the
sharp vengeance of God shall suddenly take this region, and this people,
being now by the space of many hundred years continually rebellious. For their
cities shall be turned vpsyde down, and theimselfes shall be either slain
orels taken captive to be disperpled and scatered abroad, and the course of
things turned a contrary way, they shall be bond servants and slaves unto
ye nations of the Gentiles, whom hitherto as people of abhominacion they have
detested, And Jerusalem shall be trodden down of y^ Gentiles.
and they shall be bound to oughe thanks to the same Gentyles for thissame
veraye poyncte, that there be any remaynes at all leafte unslain of so wieked
a nation as the said Jews are. Yea and this city here of Hierusasalem also
being as well in welthinesse of richesse, as also in opinion of true perfeict
religion gaily beseen, together with the temple and all (the sure building
whereof they flattre theimselfes and promise shall perpetually endure unto them
never to decay,) shall be trodden under fete by the Gentiles, until those same
times shall be completed during the which god will suffer the nation of the
Jews to be oppressed and afflicted of the Gentiles being uncircumcised,
Until the time of the Gentiles be fulfilled.
until the said Jews being chastised with long aduersyties, mai^ at the last
emende, and join together with the Gentiles into the fellowship and
brotherhood of professyng the gospel. For the same thing shall so come to
pass before the last day of the world shall come.

And as for the approchyng of the same last day many signs shall wondrefully
declare it before it come. For a drefull day shall the said day be, especially
to such persons as despise my time being quiet, and with benefits prouokyng
them of mine own offer to a better mind. And therefore shall the veraye
elements of the world, as ye would say, tremble and quake against the coming
of ye said day. Thatsame bright shynyng Sun being the fountain of light,
having been accustomed to make all things look with a merry there and
countenance, shall with sudden derkenesse cover his face. No nor the Moon
neither shall not have her entrechaungeable course of giving light unto you. The
slertes being rid with blood shall descend down from the sky upon the
earth: also a sore perplexity of minds, and an earnest desperacio^ of things
shall soodaynly come upon al nations, by reason that the sea shall boil and
swell still more and more, and the sourges thereof make a doulrull roaryng
noise aferre of. These monstreous tokens and such others many, which shall
on every side show forth theymselfes out of all parties of the world, shall
declare the terrible stroke of god to grow fast on, and therefore shall the
people of the world consume and pine away, and shall be as people in an other
world for the fear and continual expectacion of the things which shall anon
after come upon the whole universal world. For the whole nature of things
shall be shaken together out of al order: and not the earth only and the sea
shall be clean altered, but also the said most sound and massy bodies of the
world above shall be altogether moved, whereas the same have evermore until
that time been untouched and free from the alteracion of the elements, and
have used only to give their influence, And thou shall they see the son of man
come in a cloud with power
and to be woorkers upon the things that lie under them, and not to feel
any power of the interior elements entrechaungeably working or showing any
effects upon them again. Such persons as have now here in this world,
despised and bidden away with the son of man being pacient, mild and
beneficial, shall than at that hour see the same cummyng on high in a cloud
with a great power, and with most high glory. Now when ye shall see ye premises
come to pass, lift up your iyes, and lift up your heads unto thatsame city
of the heavenly Jerusalem: for tha^ shall the kingdom of God be nigh at
hand, in which there shall now be none affliccion of evils, but perpetual
quietness, and endless felicity. And the things aforesayed shall be most
undoubted tokens of ye last day to be at hand.

And the Lord added a similitude thereto: Take ye an exaumple of the trees
which do by assured tokens give men knowelage before hand of the fruicte to
follow. For ye see the figtree and others when they shootefoorth their buddes
and leaves, and by your veraye own reason ye understand that summer is
almost come, and ye begin to hope to have fruict: Right so even ye at what
time ye shall see the foresaied signs and profres toward ye change of ye
world, conceive ye an undoubted hope of ye kingdom of god now to be showed
forth, and that the evil shall no longer have power to do any care to the
good. But the wieked sort shall suffer endelesse torments: and the godly shall
have fruicion of joys eternal. If ye have already seen come to pass al yt
ever has hitherto been foreshewed unto you by the prophets and by me, believe
ye without all doubts yt these things also which I have foresaied unto you
shall semblably ensue and come to effect. This word I auouche unto you on
warauntise: yt the time of man here in this world shall not pass away before
ye these things every one shall fortune. There is nothing more stable or more
likely to endure, then is the sky and the earth, and yet shall both the sky
and the yearthe sooner vanishe away, then my words pass without taking due
effect.

For as a snare shall it come on al them that dwell on the face of y^ whole
earth. Watch ye therefore continually, and pray that ye may escape all
these things that shall come, and that ye may stand before the soonne of man.
Being therefore adcertained that this dreadful time will come, prepaire your
selfs against the cummyng of the same, that it come not upon you soodaynly as
ye lie sluggyng. And that shall ye easily do, if ye shall beware that your
hertes be not ouercharged with excess of meats and with drounkennesse, and
with the other pensife cares of this present life: but rather so live ye, For
as a snare shall it come. and.
as though the said day would come within an hour, and be as men not loving
any thing in this world, but being with your wholle hertes and minds bent
unto things heavenly. So shall it come to pass, that the said day shall not
unawares take you ere it be looked for. For unto others, who do so live, as
though the time that we speak of should never come, the day shall so come as
a snare or a trappe set by priuye stealth of some body liyng in a wait to
take an other: and shall catch al creatures, as many as have not their hertes
and iyes lift up to heaven, but dwell upon the face of ye earth, where we
have no permanent abiding, but are in haste on our way toward the same
eternal dwelling place. Watch ye therefore continually and pray.
And such persons certes while they are occupied about other matters, shall
feel theimselfes taken, before that they shall foresee the snare. And to the
intent the like case may not chance unto you, flee ye all sluggyshenesse, lie
ye not still slepyng in the sensual pleasures or cares of this world, but
keep your self still wakyng and watchyng in the earneste exercise of heavenly
things: praiyng continually that God will vouchesalue to take you in the
noumbre of them, that may escape these so great perils, and that ye may
stand upright before the judge that can not be avoided, that is to wete, the
soonne of man, who like as he does now with great favor provoke all people
to repentance, so shall he at that time with great seuerytye judge both the
quick and the dead. Leate no man think him sure enough by his own aid. No
creature shall be hable to abide this judgment, unless he be fensed
aforehande with the favor of God. But the same favor shall be with none
saving such as do in the mean time with all possible zele and exercise, go
about to show theimselfes woorthye to have it. For it shall at that time be
over late for such persons with pietious moan and lamentacion to call for his
mercy, as do now in this world abuse his pacient forbearing.

And now when the time of his death approached, Jesus did by exaumple of himself
give us a lesson, that at such times principally me^ ought to apply godly
studies and exercises, when the last day of the life draws nyghe. For what
the said last day, of which Jesus had now foreshewed so many things, shall be
unto the world: the same thing is the day of his own death unto every body
particularly. The Lord therefore did in y^ day seasons ministre ^eachyng to
do good unto those, of whom he know that he should be put to death: and as
soon as night came he went thens into the mount of Oliuete, to the en^ent he
might the more quietly give himself to prayer, wherein he made vncessaunt
intercession for the redemcio^ of the world, giving a verai small portion of
time to sleep. And as soon as the day br^ke again, the people would
customably resort unto him in the temple, to hear him teaching.

The.xxii. Chapter.

THe more that the people depended of the Lords mouth and sayings, so much
the more and more incensed were the priests, the scribes and the phariseis,
being confederate with the headmen of the lay fee, to put Jesus to death. And
now did also the time draw nere, in which it had been tofore decreed, and
was most expedyente that the same host should be killed in sacrifice for the
redemption of all mankind. For unto the conueighaunce of this determinacion,
there was specially chosen out and deputed a day of the most high
solemnity of all others, among the Jews, which they call the feast of sweet
br^ade, (because that as long as the days of the same feast lasted, it was to
the Jews a thing against all gods forbod to eat any leauened bread,) and
the same day was also called Phase, (which in the Syrians toungue is as much
to say, as a passage, or passing over, so named of a lamb of one year old,
with whose blood the highest parts of the posts were anoyncted, because the
Angel of the Lord should pass them over when he should be a destruyer of
all such as had not this mark on their doors.) And such a day was nothing
to the pay or to the mind of the priests and the scribes, who would much
li^ffer have had his death closely handled and half stolen without any such
high buisinesse or open a do, And (...) priests (...) scribes, (...).
and as like as might be to the common manier of doing execucion upon other
common malefactors. But Jesus pleasure was to have his death openly known to
the world, and to be solemnelye dooen, and in every behalf to agree with
the figures of the old testamente, and with the holy sayings of the
prophets. For this was yt holy lamb not knowing any spotte of sin, with
whose fleashe the true Israelites are daily refreashed throughout all the
wholle world, universal: with whose most holy blood we being thoroughly
cleansed, have been conueighed from damnacion, and have been delivered from
the tyranny of sin, and going daily ferther and ferther away from Egypt, we
do make haste toward thatsame heavenly land most plenteouslye flowyng
with all kind of bliss, absteinyng in the mean time from the leauened
bread, and living in the simplicity and sincerity of the spirit
evangelical. So than such a day was specially chosen of God to that same
true sacrifice, where as it nothing pleased the phariseis that it should so be.
For he suffered death, not at the arbitrament or pleasure of the Jews, but at
the pleasure of his father and himself, at such time as he would, in such
place as he would, and in such manier as he would himself. For nothing was
there in this matter either done unadvisedly or else by casualtie. The malice of
the Phariseis, almost every other day weorkyng death unto the Lord, had no
power before this time against him, because y^ although they lacked no
perverse will, yet there was not any power given them from God to accomplish
the thing which they had purposed. And yet nevertheless they do in such
sort confer and miengle their counsailles together, as though they had been
habie by their own supportacion and power to bring their will to effect. For
they feared the people.
For the malice of the phariseis and the priests being incensed many ways,
ticled and itched to lay hands on Jesus, and to bring him to his death. But
the fear of the people was a let thereunto: whom they saw brought in love
and favor toward him through showing many miracles and benefits, and to
depend altogether of his mouth. In which behalf great peril there was, lest
if they had attempted to lay hands on him in presence of the multitude, than
entered Satan into Judas.
he should by some sedicion suddenly arisyng, be taken by force and violence
out of their hands, and al their labor prove to a matter in vain, for as much
as Jesus, when he were once escaped their fyngers, would for the time to come
see and provide well enough for himself. They did not all this while remember,
that he had so many times before safe and sound without any harm at all escaped
out of the hands of the furious rageing multitude. The day also being
nothing fit for the purpose of dooyng such a thing, was not all of the most
to their contentacion, as well for the high solemnity of the feast self, as
also for the great resort of people to the same feast. But yet a fit
occasion being by an other mean offreed, when they hoped for nothing less,
and the same occasion metyng even just with their wieked will, despeched the
scruple of the festival day. For Satan, who had tempted Jesus tofore by his
very own self, persecutyng the same Jesus yet still by his ministers and
instruments, had possessed the heart of Judas Iscarioth, who was one of
those twelve specially chosen out of all the rest, whom Jesus had tofore named
Apostles. And as for this Judas the only couetise of money which daily came
through his hands, persuaded him to this furye, that of his own mocion he
went to the head priests and rewlers (for the priests also as well as other
rewlers, had men of arms about them, but not for any such purpose given
them) treactyng and commonyng with them about the betraying of Jesus into
their hands. For he knew them to be bu^sie in counsel among theimselfes
about such a matter. And no servant there was a more meie man to betraye
Jesus, then such an one as in title and profession was most familiar with
him, and in affeccion of heart an enemy. Judas had no ill opinion of the
Lord, nor had ever received any displeasure at his hand, wherefore he should
have cause to bear him any malice or il will. And they were glad.
But the pestilent corrupcion of avarice had him fast by the stomach. The
priests, they were glad men, that they had such a plaier come to play the
first pageaunt of this play. The counsel of Judas lyked them, agreemente
was made for the price which he of a sue^tie required but even very slendre,
because the case should be aunswerable to the prophecy. They promised him
money, and he promised them his service the best yt he could do. In the mean
time he sought an occasion, whereby to deliver Jesus unto them, when he
should be in some solitarye place sequestered from cumpany (which was the
thing that they desired) to the intent no sedicion might arise through the
favorers of him. And Judas was well acquainted with all places where the lord
used to be solitary.

And now was the day of sweet bread come, the highest holy day that the
Jews had, in which according to the prescripcion of the law, the la^be was
to be slain, Than came the day of swetebread.
which the Jews call Phase, of passing over, (as I have already said.) But
the true Phase was the lord Jesus that lamb most pure, than to be slain in
sacrifice for redemption of the world, according to the eternal determinacion
of his father. Therefore because Jesus would ye more diepely inprint in the
hertes of his dysciples the memory of his death, and would make it plain
and open unto them, that he suffered all these things both knowing of it
before, and also willinglye: his mind was so, that in the last supper that ever
he had to make with them, he would by mystical tokens make among them a
representacion of the thing, which he should ye next day following execute and
accomplish upon the cross, because he was not ignorant how greatly they
would afterward be dismayed by his death. He therefore preue^teth the time,
while their minds were not yet past taking of good counsayll and
aduertisemente. The dooyng of this matter he committed to two of his chiefly
beloved Apostles, Peter and John. Go ye twain (says he) and prepare for all
us the paschal lamb, that we may eat it altogether. Thou hear now in these
words the beginning of the church and the end of the Synagogue. where will thou that we prepare.
Now forbecause Jesus, though he were the Lord and creator of all things, yet
had no house of his propre own, nor of any certainty to point upon, the
said two disciples demanded where his will and pleasure was to have ye paschal
supper made ready for him. So great strangers forsooth and so unacquainted
were the disciples with in the city, that they scarcely had any perfect knowlage
of any house therein. For even very such ought the true disciples of Christ
to be in this world. Than Jesus, to the intent he would show, that no part
of all the things that were forthwith to follow was to him unknown, said
unto them: Behold as soon as ye shall be entered into the city, there shall
a man come toward you cariyng a pitcher full of water. Follow the same fellow
even to the house that he shall enter into. And there shall ye say to the good
man of the house: The master has willed us to say unto thee in his behalf,
where is the parler, wherein I may eat the paschall lamb with my disciples?
The Master says to thee. etc.
The party shall byanby know the title of master, even as an other did one day
acknowlage thee calling of me, Lord, at what time ye untied the Asses colte.
This party shall without any delay, show you a great wide parlour with a
bourde already covered and all things prepared for a repast there to be taken
in it: and there make ye the pascall lamb ready for me. Now consider me this
point, o friend Theophilus, an host of none acquaintance it is, that finds
Christ the parloure to suppe in: and a bearer of water is yt leder unto the
house where Christ keeps the solemnity of his pasche. For by mean of
baptism, and by the doctrine of gods word, is the entering into the church:
the lively water of gods word does cleanse, and the water also of the sacrament
does cleanse. The good man of the house has no name expressed, because the
church of Christ is euerywhere, springyng first up of derke and low
beginnings, but spreadyng it self ferther and ferther abroad from day to day
into the whole universal world. And they went. etc.
And because the beginning of all health and salvation is faith, the discyples
believe the lord, and are obediently rewled by him. They depart into the city,
they find him that was carriyng the pitcher of water, they follow the same as
he goes before and leads the way. They declared to the good man of the house
such message as they had been commanded. He shows them a great large
dinyng parlour. For wide and large it must needs be which is able to receive
all the nations of the world. For the Jews Synagogue is but a place of narow
room. And far from earthly things must such people be sequestered, as are
disposed to eat the meat celestial. Here in this place than do the disciples
prepare the supper, verily executyng the office of pastors.

And when it was now supper time, Jesus came thither, and sat down to eat
with his twelve specially chosen disciples, because the residue were not yet
able to receive the deep hidden mystery, which his pleasure was that it should
by mean of his Apostles be made common unto such as were once already entered
in the mystical rules and profession of the gospel. Than as soon as meat
and drink was set before them on the table, the lord to the intent he might
depely enprient in the minds of his Apostles, that he would suffer the death
of the cross, not for any necessity at all to himself ward, but only for
the love of redemyng mankind, said unto them: With great and earnest desire
have I desired to eat this pascal la^be with you before my death, Henceforth I
will not eat of it any more. etc
the time whereof I rejoice to be now come, because I thirst the rede^pcion of
man. For this word I assure you of, from this time forthward, I will not eat
this pasche with you according to the litterall ordeinaunce and prescripcion of
the law: but an other pasche of more perfeccion shall after the spirit be
accomplished in the kingdom of god. This lamb here which is every year once
sole^nely killed of the Jews, comprised a figure of my death. Now is the true
thing self come in place, and the shadow shall cease: ye shall from hensforth
solemnise unto me a ghostly and an effectual passover, the eating whereof
shall make you immortal. And he teke the cup and gave thanks.
So after that they had every one tasted of the lambs fleashe, Jesus took the
cup in his hand, and gave thanks unto his father: and than giving the
first assaye of the cup, and holdyng it forth unto them, he said unto his
disciples: Take ye and divide ye this emongst you. And take ye this for a true
word of my mouth: I will not from hensforth drink of the fruit of the
vynetree for the necessity of the fleashe, but the kingdom of God shall
immediately be present. Every one of these things which the law has had
outward and carnal, shall be spiritually showed and ministered. And thus far
is an end of the figures of the law. Immediately hereupon the lord Jesus
entendyng by a mystical figure or token to consecrate to his servants a new
testament, took bread, and after thanks giving to his father, he brake it
with his own hands, and delivered it unto the disciples, saying: This is my
body, which is betrayed unto death for you. My death shall not be done any
more then this once. This do in the remembrance of me.
For this only one sacrifice of my death, is sufficient for the sins of all
ages and times, as well paste as to come. But ye shall oftentimes renew unto
yourselues the memory of my tender love toward you, dooyng the like among
your selves, that ye now see done of me. For this shall be an high and holy
sign of a band and league made between me and you. Than as soon as supper
was done, he took the cup also, and reachyng it forth to them he said:
This is the new testament consecrated not with the blood of a calfe or a goat,
but with mine own blood, which is poured forth for the redemyng and saving
of you: ye have now the highest token and pledge that can be of mine entier
love toward you.

And in deed there ought to be a like love in you toward me again: but yet
there is one here at the table amongst you, who will betraye me into the
hands of them which seek me unto death. Neither is all this done by
casualtie: but it is so prefixed by the determinacion of God, Woe unto that man
by whom he is betrayed.
it is so foreshewed by the prophets, that the son of man should by such a
process, redeem mankind. Indede a good necessary point of service it is,
that he does herein toward the universal redempcio^ of man: but yet because
he does it of a wicked mind, the same thing shall in conclusion turn to his
damnacion, the which shall be the instrumente of salvation to others. The
determinacion of god does not draw him to this deiuelishe act, but he is
led thereunto of his own inordinate couetise. And they began to enquier
among themselfes. etc.
This saying of Jesus sore dismayed all their hertes, and cast them in a great
passion: and they begone to ask and search among themselves who it should be
of whom Jesus had spoken. Not one of them knew himself culpable in his
conscience besides Judas Iscarioth only: and yet durst not one of them trust
his own self in the matter. Notwithstanding Jesus bewrayed not his betrayer,
but oftentimes pricked his conscience, to thentent he should emende. And he
knew well enough that Judas would nevertheless continue still in his madness,
teaching us therewhyle to use the most favor possible toward sinners,
forasmuch as we cannot be sure, whether the same parties may one day come to
themselves again or not.

But I am among you as he that ministers, ye are they which have abidden with
me in my temptacions. And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my father has
appointed unto me: that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and
sit on seats, iudgeyng the twelve trybes of Israel. Now because the Lord
Jesus had in the supper time made mention of the kingdom of god, there
eftesones befell a contencion among the disciples being yet weak, and having
yet still in some behalf a smatche of the fleashe, which of them should after
the lords death have the prima^ie and supremitie in the kingdom of God. The
kings of nations reign over them. etc.
For in holdyng forth the bread and the cup unto the^, he seemed to make them
all eguall one with another, saying: divide ye this among you. But Jesus
although he had at sondrie times before also called them back from such
affeccion, yet being now very nere toward his death, he repeateth the same,
and bea^eth it into their heads, saying: Do not ye imagine any such like
thing in the kingdom of heaven, as ye see in worldly kingdoms. It is a far
other sort of reygnyng: for it stands by benefits and not by force of
arms: it is kept and defended by spiritual fence, and not by violence: it is
dilated and enlarged in circuit by persuasion of words, and not by forceable
compulsion. For the princes of this world do exercise a lordelye power over
such people as they have the government and rewle of (for they do not use
persuasion of words to make them love honest ways, but they fear them from
evil doings by terror of punishemente:) and of their subjects, they require
to have honor and reverence done unto them, though they be not worthy
thereof. Yea and the nerer they draw to the point of tyranny, so much the
more obedience and subieccion do they require to have of their commons: and
all the while are they honored of the same people with titles and styles of
estate and royaltee. They have names and styles given them to be called
princes, fathers to their country, sauers and defendours, and consuls, because
by their power they keep their inferiors under subieccion. Of this sort
forsothe is the reygnyng of the heathen nations. But among you, whom I frame
and break to the kingdom of the gospel, But ye shall not so be.
there shall be a far other trade. The greater that every one shall be among
you, so much the less shall take unto him of violent power, or of glory. For
he shall not have an iye to oppress or ouertrede his inferiors with the good
gifts and qualities which he has received of god, but how to do his
inferiors good thereby, and how to relieve them: neither shall he take the
laud and praise unto himself, but refer the same entierly unto god. And yet I
speak not this, as though there shall not be any order in this kyndome, but
because that he which is chosen to the preeminence of being a guide unto
others toward godliness, shall so greatly serve the commodities of all
persons, But he that is greattest among you. etc.
that he may seem to be a minister and a servant rather then an head. He shall
make no sekyng ne suite for favor: but his good heart and mind being most
quick and ready to do good unto all persons, shall deserve justly to have
it. And as for his authority, his perfeccion of living shall maintain it and
not his proud disdeynefull look, or stately port and countenance.

And let it not grieve truly to perform and show the same humilitee among
yourselues, which I have thoroughly showed unto you, whereas of my due right I
might have taken unto me the state of Lordely power and dominion. For considre
and pondre ye this in your minds, whether of the two seems the greatter man,
he that serves at the table, orels he that sits at ye table and is served:
does not he that sits seem the greatter man? Not for that whosoever sits
down, For whether is gretter. etc.
is in deed the greatter man: but he rather which enterteineth others with
making them a feast, is even for this very respect the greater of dignity,
because he does good to many. And yet such an one for courtesy and good
manners sake when the others whom he has called to his feast do sit at the
table, goes about the house from place to place careful and diligent to see
that no person lack any thing in the feast, and so the carfulness of him
alone provides for the satisfiyng and well being of all the coumpanye. And
have not I used my self like such an one among you? Have not I in such sort
been conuersaunt among you, as though I were the servant of you all, mynystryng
to you of that that was mine own, and taking care my self alone for you all?
How much more ought ye to be far from al tirannye and ambicion, which in
condition and state are all eguall one with an other, which ministre unto
others of my things, and not of your own, and which have one master egually
indifferent unto you all? But I a^^ among you etc.
Ye have received ye same high and holy caucion or token and pledge of
eua^gelical concord, that with what entier love I have embraced you, with
the same love ye should embrace one another, among your selfs. And where
reigns ambicion, there cannot concord be at any sure stay. In the mean
time honor must be willyngly deserved, but not usurped or taken as a thing
of duty and right. For the princes of this world, although they do their
office rightlye, yet because they require homage and fealty of their subjects
therefore, they shall not have any reward at all for it before god. But as for
ye, puttyng away al care as touching your reward, leat your minds be only
upon your office and duty, it shall be mine office to provide for you, as
touching your dignity. If ye shall be true folowers of my humility, ye shall
also be partakers of my glory: if ye shall be fellows with me in taking such
part of affliccions as I do, Ye are they which have abiden with me
intemptacions.
the^ shall ye also have such part of immortality in heaven as I have. And
hitherto have ye persisted and continued with me in mine affliccyons, by which
affliccions it has pleased my heavenly father to have mine obedience thoroughly
tried and approved. Neither lowness of degree, nor poverty, not the
trauailles of this life, not the obloquie of men, not the Phariseis laiyng
await for you, not the threatenyng of men of power, has disseuered you from
coumpaniyng and living with me, whereas others have fallen away from me, whereas
others have not had the bold spirit to profess themselves disciples of mine.
That if ye shall still persist in the same mind that ye have hitherto had, and
shall not irke in the mean time to follow my humility, to the end ye may the
better profit all persons: I again on my part shall bring to pass, that ye
shall an other day be partakers of the glory of my kingdom. For it has so
pleased my father, that this shall be the way to the kingdom of heaven. And
the same have I heretofore opened unto you, and will do again thorough my
death. That ye may eat and drink at mytable.
By mean of lowenesse my father shall exalte me to the glory of a kingdom:
and by temporal affliccions, to joys everlasting. And like as there is a
kingdom prepared for me of my father, because I in the mean while according
to his will, do behave and use my self as a minister, and not as a Lord:
even so will I, after that I am exalted to the dignity of my kingdom, prepare
the feloweshyppe of the same kingdom for you that follow my steps, in such
wise that ye, which have not sought for honor here in this world, And
^^e^con se^ates* etc.
but have behaved your selfs as ministers and servants unto all others,
diligently dispensing the doctrine of the gospel, shall sit with me at my
table in my kingdom, not now as ministers, but as the honorable children of
god. And where ye are now for my sake reputed among ye Jews for persons
most abject: ye shall at that hour sit as head men of dignity upon twelve
thrones, iudgyng the twelve tribes of Israel. For at that day shall the
vasenesse of such people appear, as at this present seem to sit on high
benche in this world: and so shall your highness, who seem at this day to be
the outcastes of the world. Thus much did the lord Jesus speak under a
figure, qualifiyng and te^peryng his words to the rawnesse of his disciples,
which rawnesse be suffered for these causes to remain a long season in them:
partly because he would in us the more effectually pluck out such worldly
affeccio^s as the disciples were at that time subject unto, and partly because
we should learn with great patience and favor to suffer the weakness and
frailty of other folks, until they may grow to things of more perfeccion.

There was no more remaining but for him to arm the minds of his disciples
against the tempeste even than approchyng, and to root out of their hertes the
puttyng of their trust and confidence in themselfes. For the sudden storms of
affliccions does to no persons so over give an overthrow, then to such as
have a confidence and boldness in their own strength. But such persons as
utterly mistrustyng their own assuredness, that is to say, all worldly aid
and mainteinaunce of man, do wholly depend of gods defense and help: such
and none others are hable to stand sure against all the vproares and tumultuous
businesses of this present world: So than turned he his tale unto Peter, to
the intent he might by exaumple of Peter, train and correct them all. For he
knew Peter to be of a more quick and pressed spirit the^ the others, and to
be one that put very much confidence in himself, of a tender good affeccion
certes, but yet humain and worldly. For he had not yet received thatsame holy
spirit of god, Behold, satan has desired to ^y^t you.
being the bounteous geuer of al virtue. He therefore said: Simon, Simon,
behold, Satan has earnestlye desired to have you all, that he might winow and
sifte you as they do wheat, of a purpose to blow you in soondre if he might.
And he would so have done in deed, in case ye had been or should be leaft to
your own frailty: but I have hartyly prayed my father for thee Peter, that
although thy faith will be somewhat waueryng, yet it may not fail clean away.
The first exaumple hereof it has pleased him to show upon thee which
trustest very much on thy self, And when thou art converted. etc
to the end that being come to thyselfe again after thy fall, thou may by
exaumple of thy self confirm thy brethren wha^ they shall through the same
frailty be fallen, to the end they may every one of them understand, that no
man may possibly of his own strength be an hable match against the malice of
Satan, unless he be stayed with my aid and mainteinaunce. Peter when he
heard these words, trustyng yet still in his own strength, answers.
Lord, what falling a way from thee, or what conversion do thou tell me of?
I am ready to go with thee into prison. etc.
Naie, thou shall perceive and find me a constant man in faith, and impossible
to be ouercomed. And like as I have not hitherto at any time forsaken thee, so
will I not forsake thee at any time hereafter neither: insomuche that I am
ready to put my self in extreme danger of my life with thee, whether it be to
go into prison, yea or to death either. This saying of Peter procedyng truly
out of a good and a plain menyng heart, but yet not eue^ thoroughly known unto
himself: I tell thee Peter. etc.
the lord immediately repressed with this au^swer* what say thou Peter? Art
thou he that wilt go into prison, and to death with me? Nay I tell thee
another contrary tale aforeha^d. For it will so cum to pass, yt thou wylt
thrice reneague me, and wilt swear thou know me not, eue^ this present
night before the cock crow twice: so great shall the storm of affliccio^ be
upon thee.

After that he had plucked out of their hertes, the puttyng of their affiaunce
and trust in themselfes: he eftsons beats into their heads, the thing that
he had oftentimes to fore taught them, which was, that they should not defend
theimselfes with worldely defense, against the violence of evil persons,
because that a minister of the heavenly doctrine of the gospel ought to be fre
from the vile cares of this life: When I sent you without wallet. etc.
ne ought not with any other armor or weapon to be appointed against all the
assaults of the wicked sort, then with the sweorde of the spirit, which is
the word of god. At what time I sent you (quod he) for a proof and assaie to
preach among the Jews how the kyngedome of god approached, Lacked ye any
thing?
and sent you so unfurnished of all provision, that ye had not so much as
purses about you to put any money in, nor so much as a poor scrippe to
keep any meat in against an other time of houngre, no nor yet shoes for
saving of your fete: yet did ye want any thing? They answered, that they had
wanted nothing. But now he that has a wallet let him take it up. etc.
Than Jesus to the entente he would utterly pluck up by ye root out of their
stomakes all desire of auenging, beguileth them for a while with the deckenesse
of his words: but he suffers the^ for this purpose to ren^e in a wrong
opinion, because he would the more surely and the more effectually pluck out
of their minds al affeccion of auengyng any quarrels. For he knew that they
should be enkiendled to an earneste will of defendyng and reskewyng him, wha^
they should see armed soldyers with such great stiere and ru^felyng to invade
and fall upon their master who^ they very earnestly loved, though
nevertheless it was as yet after the affeccionate sort of humain love and
worldely. Which human affeccion and love if he had not evidently chastised,
we would have thought it to be lawful to defend our selfs with weapon
against the violence of wicked persons, and to put away force with force. But
now seeing that Peter was shent because that he drew his sweorde against a
deuelishe and heinous coumpany for his masters cause, being a man most
innocent* what cause may there than be from hensfoorth, why a Christian body
should put away wrong with wrong? And thus said the Lord: At the first
preaching of the gospel ye went light and unfurnished of any provision for
your living. But yet thorough my supportacion and sure defense ye wanted
nothing. And that was enough, when there was no sore storm nere toward you.
But from he^sforth ye must prepare your hertes to hardier matters. For ye more
extreme and sore ye storm of persecucio^ shall be, so much the lighter is it
mete that ye be from al yearthely lettes and encoumbraunces. Now is there a
great battayl toward, and ye shall have need of a sweord. Wherefore if any man
percase has a pouche or a scrippe, let him take it up, that he may bye him a
sweorde. That in case he have not these things the which in deed may be cast
away from you, and which ye have lacked without any incommoditie unto you:
leat him sell his coat and bye him a sweord. It is nedeful for a body to come
to this batail, very light of carryage, nor armed with any other thing the^
with a sweorde. The matier will sure come to extremes. For they will not only
lay violent hands on me, but also it must needs be performed yt Esai long
agon prophesied should become of me: Esaias. iiii. Even among the wicked was he
reputed.
And even among the wicked was he reputed. If it be a sore and a grievous
matter to be killed, how much sorer a thing is it to suffer such shameful
execucion and peines of death as all men speak eiuil of, yea and the same to
suffer among heinous malefactors? And yet this chance also is the soonne of
man sure to have. For now the time is even at hand, that whatsoever has been
foresaid by the prophets concerni^g me, must be accomplished. The Apostles
whereas they understood not the mystery of these sayings, and deemed that the
lord had said it to put them in remembrance to have a sweorde in readiness
to put of from them some violence being toward, Lord, beeholde, here are
two sweordes.
answered plainly without mening any fraud: Master behold, there be two
sweordes here already: supposyng in very deed, that in any wise they should
need sweordes, but fearyng lest that two sweordes would not be enough for
that fight. They showed their good heart and affeccion to fight for the Lords
sake, whom they knew was hable enough of his own power to supply, if their
defense and strength wanted any thing, like as he had before yt time multiplied
the five loaves and two fishes to make the^ suffice many thousands of people.
In this so gross an affeccio^, did Jesus at that present leave his disciples,
to the intent (as I have said) that their weakness might be an instruccio^ for
us unto perfect patience in suffering tribulacion. He therefore answered: It
is enough. This did they take as a thing so spoken, as though the first fray
might be borne of with the two sweordes, which they had the^ ready, whereas
Christ's menyng was of a ghostely fight against the world and the deiuill: in
which fight, the victory cu^meth of an heart being lightened and discharged
from al earthly desires, and armed with the only sweord of heavenly doctrine.
And the said victory consists in the vndefeasable scripture of the old and
new testamente, so that a man may understand two sweordes, but the same
sweordes, delivered forth by one spirit.

And because men of arms when they shall enter a fight, are wont against a
bickering with their enemy approchyng nere the^, to refreashe their bodies, and
to pluck up their hertes: the Lord being minded to show unto his servants,
what thing it was that might most principally strengthen them against such
ioynyng in battle when it is toward: went forth of Jerusalem, and according
to his accustomed usage, went to mount Oliuete, his disciples accoumpanying
him. And when they were cu^ to the privy place where his wont was to pray,
he said unto them. To the intent and purpose that ye may be hable manfully to
stand against the tempest that hangs over you, watch ye, and pray ye, lest
if the same come soodaynely upon you as ye lie sluggyng and idle, it may take
you in the trappe ere ye be aware, and so may overcome you. The Lord when he
had thus much spoken, withdrew himself from their cumpany to the mountenau^ce
in manner of a stones cast, to pray solitarily for all creatures, like as he
should afterward in his own sole person suffer death for all creatures.

But like as his death did not profit idle persons, so must not his prayer
neither be auaillable, but unto such as have diligente and earnest mind to
pray for themselfes too. Father if thou will. etc.
And to give us a lesson that the heart is to be submitted as often as we
address to speak and talk with God: He prayed his father on his knees bowed
down to the ground, saying: Father if it be thy will, Nevertheless not my
will but thine be fulfilled.
remove thissame cup away from me. I feel the humain nature which I have
taken, to abhor from death: but in this behalf leat the redemption of man
overcome* and leat that be done, which thy will being vnmutable, has
determined, and not the thing which the weakness of this body does give
advise or mocion unto. Our Lord knew what the will of his father: was, and on
his own party he covered to dri^ke the cup of death for the redemption of the
world, and he laid upon himself the affeccion of his body, and studied to
prescribe unto his servants a form and trade of praiyng. And there appeared
unto him an angel from heaven co^forting him
For this manner of praiyng were very fit for a martyr a little before the time
of his martyrdom: Thy will be dooen, and not mine. Whether thy will be to have
me live or to dye. And this fearful tremblyng of our nature, Christ took upon
himself, because he would take it away from his. But to the intent he would
teach us that at such times we should have pressed help ready at the lords
hand, when we had wholly committed our selfs to the will of god, whether it be
to life or death, there appeared unto him an aungel down from heaven
strengthenyng him. As he was cast in great agony and pangues for our behoufe,
so was he for our behoufe cumforted and strengthened by ye angel.

After all this there took him a certain extreme agony and trouble of mind,
such as for the most part is wont to chance unto men when they have
death even before their iyes, and behold it in their minds. And this passion
is commonly wont to be more grievous the^ very death self. Neither did Jesus
disdain to take this tormente of mind also for our cause, who refused not for
our cause to hang on the cross, teaching us in the mean time, to what
succors we ought to take our refuge, And his sweat was like drops of blood.
as often as thatsame quaking fear shall take our infirmity and cease upon
it. For liyng down prostrate upon ye ground he prayed yet more earnestly.
Forsooth hereof depends the whole hope of our victory. And verify to the
intent we should be the more steadfast in time of suffering pain and torment:
so great trouble of mind took Christ, that drops of blood tricled down to
the earth from all his body over.

And when he arose up from prayer and was cum to his disciples, he found them
slepyng for heaviness, and said unto them: why sleep ye? Rise and pray,
lest ye fall into temptacion. As Soon as he arose again from praiyng and stood
upright, he returned unto his disciples, and found them slepyng for sorrow and
heaviness. Thatsame was not any surfaict that had made them so heavy, but the
weakness of nature: it was grievous dolor of the mind that had caused their
sleep: but whosoever will in such a bataill go away a conqueror, must fight
against this weakness, with the lusty strength of the spirit. Jesus
therefore chideth his disciples, and eftsons calls them up to pray, saying:
why do ye in so great daungier and ieopardy give your selfs to sleep? Arise
ye and pray, lest the tempest growing fast toward, do oppress you and
ouerwhelme you, even as ye lie sluggyng: for the hour is even now very nere at
hand.

The Lord Jesus had not yet ended these words, and even now already appeared
in sight a rabble of ungracious soldiers, whom the priests and Phariseis
being more ungracious then they, had purposely sent for to attache Jesus. And
that honest man Judas, who had but even a little before been a follower of
Christ, and a companion with him at his table, and now become the guide of a
deuelishe band of soldiers, came before them a good preatye way between, but
he had given them a token before (for so to do is a thing commonly used in
wars) that to who^soeuer he should give a kiss, him should they well wete to
be Jesus. And when he had cum sumwhat nere unto Jesus eue^ ready now to kiss
him as he had been wont to do, the lord according to his accustomed mildness,
refused not ye traiters kiss neither, but yet eftsons pricked his conscience,
to the^tent that being moved at leastwise with so great patience and favor of
the lord, he might have amended. Judas (says he) art thou a betraier of the
son of man with a kiss? Judas beetraiest thou the son of man with a kiss?
Judas by that word well understood that his heart was not hidden from God: He
knew the innocencye of the Lord: he was so many times with such myldenesse
of the Lord, as never the like was heard, so provoked to change from his
wicked entente and purpose: even a very flinte stone might have been suppled
therewith, had not Satan altogether possessed his whole heart with the disease
and corrupcion of couetise. And truly the deuelishnesse of Judas was cause of
da^nacion to himself alone and no mo. But such persons as do now in
these times with se^blable guile betray the verity eua^gelical unto ye princes
of this world, are causers of a more grievous confusion, and are worthy of
greater punishment, then unhappy Judas ouerlate taking repentance of his
fact, did execute upon himself. Immediately upon the kiss given, the company
of the harnessed men came rennyng unto Jesus to lay hands upon him, and
they were such as for none other purpose had a mind and will to know Jesus,
but that they might take him. But happy are those folks who labor to know
the euangelcail word of God, of a purpose to be folowers of Jesus. Than the
other disciples seeing such violence to be attempted and intended toward
their master, love ministered such boldness of heart unto them, that they
said to the Lord: Lord will thou that we strieke^ with the sweorde? Lord
shall we smyteth the sword^
They had freashe in remembrance, what the lord had tofore said unto them of
byinge of a sweord: but because they had seen in him perpetual myldenesse
never faillynge, they doubted whether he would suffer them to occupy any
sweordes.

But Peter, who loved the lord more feruentely then the others, and who had
above all the rest made a voluntary promise of hardy and stout acts, never
tarried for the Lords answer, but stroke with the sweorde at one of the chief
priests servants, which first enterprised to lay hand on Jesus, as one
that expressed or resembled the cruelty of his master. But the mildness of
the lord moderatyng the stroke, And stroke of his right ear.
Peter no more but cut of the fellows right ear. Happy are those persons
that ever they were horn whose ear that has hitherto herkened to the wicked
priests and to the carnal law, is cut of: and being restored and set on
again of Christ, does how harken to such things as are material to
everlasting salvation. The ear cut of was a wound more subject to the
obloquie and ill speaking of the people, than it was dangerous for the life or
body: but yet nevertheless a wound incurable, because the gristle of the
earepiece being once cut in two, cannot close ne grow together again. But
Jesus to whom no wound is incurable, after he had chidden Peter, for that
contrary to the evangelical myldenesse, but remembryng still the old law,
Suffer ye thus far, forth. etc.
he had begone to fight with the sweorde, restored unto Malchus his ear, and
set it on again so that there appeared no sign of any wou^d that ever had
been there. For the soldiers and servants did least offense of all, whose
mere folly served the turn of the priests, the Phariseis, and the Scribes
malice. Peter should rather have bestowed his fierce anger upon the^, had it
not so pleased God, that evangelical victory should consiste in pacient
suffreyng.

Than Jesus to declare that he willyngly suffered all things, turnyng himself
to the cumpaignye, whom the priests and Scribes had sent, said unto them:
what chance is befallen, that ye now armed and weaponed with sweordes and
clubbes, have issued forth of the city by night, and do thus come rennyng
hither as it were in form of open war, to vanquyshe a common robber
defendyng himself with the sword and making resistance? Whereas I have been
daily with you in the temple, ready to come to for every body that would,
But this is even your verai hour the power of derknesse
and a naked man, without any weapon, no creature laid any hands upon me.
Truly ye had than even the same will that ye now have: but his will was than
a let unto you, whom no creature is hable to resist. For the time in which
I was determined to suffer, was not yet come. But this is your time, the night
time: and this is the power of darkness permitted of God. The Lord Jesus
immediately wha^ he had thus said, without making any strongleyng or
resistance, willyngly offreed himself to be bound with cords. The coumpainye
as soon as they had him fast, brought him into the house of Cayphas, who at
that time was the chief head of the priests, that is to say, of the most
naughtiest portion of all the whole people of the Jews. Into the inner court
of this Caiphas palaice, had gathered themselves together the conuocacion of
the priests, the Scribes, the phariseis, and the head rewlers of the people,
and also there had gathered into the same place, the other multitude, which
either of a fear or of affeccion, or of being deceived with a wrong opinion,
were as instruments of the foresaid companies malice.

In the mean time the disciples being strieken with fear, had run away one
to one place and another to another place. But Peter, (who had nothing
prosperously played the man in his masters behalf in making a fraye with
Malchus, but yet nevertheless had not vttrely put away all hope that the
matier should recover and do well enough) followed after Jesus a good way
behind. He also took a good heart to him, and adventured in the derke to enter
into the hall of the bishops palaice, Peter also sat down among them:
and to make one among the press of the other servants, as a man unknown to
any body there. And being a fire made of coals in the mids of the palaice
court, because the night time was cold, emo^gst the other servants sittyng
by the fire to warm them, Peter also sat emongst the more, and warmed himself
by the coals, whom when a certain wenche of the house had espied sitting in
such facion, that his face was even full in the light of the fire, beholding
him somewhat steadily, she knew him by sight of old, and because she would
declare herself to be of her masters sort she cried out by an by in the
hearing of all the other coumpaynye: yea and this fellow too was with him that
is taken. This was not a thing done by casual chance: but so it pleased the
dispensacion of God, tho thentente the confidence which Peter had in himself,
might the better be caulmed and damped, who whereas he had tofore made such a
royal promise unto the lord, that he would not shrynke to go with him even to
very death too, did now at the word of a peluishe woman reneague his master.
For Petur being feared with this saying of a woman, answered desperately, as
if his heart had been in his hele clean goen. And he denied him saying: woman I
know him not.
Thou woman I have none acquaintance with him. And by that means did Peter
for the first plounge escape. But within a while comes the like dau^gier
again. For one of the servants eftsons begone to know him metelye
perfectly, and said unto him: yea and thou too art one of the nombre of them
whose master and Capitain we have taken. Peter being eftsons by reason of
these words as one half out of the world for fear, said. Thou man, I am
none of them: and swore that he knew not Jesus. Thus escaped he once more, by
forswearyng himself, And yet did it not all this while come in his mind what
the Lord had told him before, and what promise himself had made to the
Lord. All this while was Jesus in examinacion before the wicked counsel, and
was strieke^ with buffettes contrary to the manier and order of judgments,
or courts of justice, Peter beholding it a good way of, and lookyng still
what end the matier was like to have. But much about the space of an hour
after, a certain other fellow of the servants, being cousin to him, whose
ear Peter had strieken of, beholding Peter well knew him, and said: I
promise you, this fellow also was with Jesus in the herbare. And when he said
it was not so, the other said morouer: The thing to be true that I say, even
his very own toungue does declare. For he is one of Galile borne. There
Peter being altogether cast in an extreme fear, And Peter said: man, I wot
not what thou say. etc.
begone to swear naie to the mattier, and to bid the devil take him, if he
did so much as understand of what Jesus, of what herbare, or of what fellows
of Galilee it was, that the servant spoke. So far had he vttrely forgotten
himself, who should afterward be one of the chief of the congregation. In
the mean season while Peter reneagueth, while he swears naie, while he
curses himself, while he gives himself body and soul to the devil, the
cock crewe the second time, which was the token that the Lord had given
him: and yet did he not thereby neither come to himself again.

Neither was he like to have made any end of straying out of the right way,
had not the Lord through the mids of the wicked coumpaynye there, And the
lord turned back and looked upon Peter.
turned his iyes upon Peter, and had earnestly beheld him. Peter being touched
with the lokyng of his master upon him, remembered the words which the lord
had a little before said unto him: Before the cock crow twice this night,
thou shall thrice reneague and deny me: and being sodaynlye touched with
earnest sorrow, he conveyed hymsefe forth of the doors, and wept bitterly.
What thing Peter did, the same would the other disciples also have done if like
necessity had come in ure: But in the only person of Peter it pleased Jesus to
teach all others, that no man trust in himself, ne that no man miengle or
associate himself in the compayny of evil persons: It was night. Love was
weaxed stone cold in him: He was warmyng himself by the fire of wicked folks,
he was sittyng in coumpayny amongst a deiuilishe sort, in the house of
Cayphas the bishop, whereas himself should afterward be a bishop, but much
unlike to Cayphas. But there in bishop Cayphas house what ungracious deeds of
mischief is there that are not done? There was a conspiracy made for the
death of Jesus, by the priests, the phariseis, the Scribes, and the elders of
the people. From thence were sent forth harnessed men against him: there is
he bound: there is he scourged: there has he his face covered: there is he
skorned: there is he accused. There does Peter commit perjury: there does
he accurse himself: a great and grievous crime unless frailty excused it.
For Peter offended not of a prepensed malice as Judas had done, but through
heaviness of heart wherewith he was astouned. For he had not come thither of
a purpose to reneague Jesus, but only that he might behold the end of the
judgment, whereas he was not yet sufficientlye confirmed to die with Christ.
For the time was not yet come. Therefore how many soever have fallen into any
grievous crime, leat them pray the lord Jesus that he will vouchesafe to
turn his iyes upon them: and than shall they strayghtwayes acknowlage in
themselfes from what state, into what ease they are fallen.

Let them withdraw themselves from ungracious coumpayny, and leat them wash
away their fault with teres, testifying their heart to be converted and
changed.

In the mean season was all thatsame night passed over and spente in mockes
and scorns against Jesus. For the fellows that had apprehended Jesus scorned
him, geuyng him both reprochefull words and strokes thereto. And because they
had heard say that the people had him in reverence as a prophet, they
blyndefolde his iyes, and so buffeted him on the face, saying: Arede now and
tell by the spirit of prophecy, what man has given the any blows. With many
other words of mockage and reproach did that wicked company continue railing
on Jesus the fountain of all glory, so that none of us ought to take grievously
to be reviled or rayled at for the word of the gospel, or to suffer
affliccion and evil turns at the hands of such persons, as serve the
minds of vnreligious bishops, as do things to fulfill the appetite of cloked
Phariseis, as do things to satisfy the fancy of folyshe princes.

Now as soon as the fair daylyght was once come, the chief of the priests,
the Scribes, and the head rulers of the people, pretending now to sit and keep
court in due form of judgment, assemble together to a great noumbre. And
when they had summoned Jesus personally to appear in their court, they
demanded many questions of him, hunting for one point or other out of his
words, which they might there openly lay to his charge. The crime wherewith
to charge him is but even than in sekyng, when they be already set in
judgment, and his death being determinately appointed upon, they look about
and devise by what title or color some cause of death may be laid unto him.
Art thou very christ? tell us.
Whereupon thus speak they unto him: If thou be thatsame Christ whom
according to the godly sayings of the prophets we look for, tell it us
plainly. But Jesus knowing them to move such questions not of any purpose to
learn the truth, but to hunt for some matier of false accusacion against him,
thus made answer unto them: If I shall tell you what I am, ye will not give
credit unto me: and in case I should question with you by the testimonies of
the scriptures, If I tell you, ye will not believe.
what manner of man it was promised that Messiah should be, and whether the same
tokens do justly agree in my person, ye will not answer according to your
consciences, as men that have not any earnest desire to learn that is true,
nor yet to teach it. Neither will ye upon any such cause or consideracion
acquit and discharge me, if I shall declare mine innocence unto you. For ye
do not by your opposyng and examining me, mean either upon knowlage of the
truth to discharge me if I be innocent, or to condemn me being found guilty,
(as in lawful judgments is commonly vfed to be done) but for this intent
that the thing which ye have determined to do, ye may seem to do by some
title and color of justice. Therefore will not I tell you the thing which
though ye know, yet ye will not know: but an other thing will I tell you,
which ye shall one day find to be true. The son of man, who at this
present moment by reason of the weakness of his humayne nature, Hereafter
shall the son of man sit. etc.
and of his humility, is not agnised and knowlaged of you being proud and
hault minded men, shall in time to come be above earth on hye, syttyng on the
right hand of Gods Majesty. These words did Jesus speak, to thentent that
forasmuch as they had more mind and will to put Jesus to death because he
was in form of humility, by whom they might have been saved, then to
enbrace him: they should have knowledge that they should an other day see him
a judge and a punisher of their ungodliness, who^ being a salueour promised
and so many hundred years looked for, they would not now acknowlage. Such a
word seemed unto them all a meet and sufficient occasion to lay some false
accusacion against him, in case he would no more but openly take upon him
that he was the son of god. Whereupon they say: Why than art thou thatsame
son of God, Art thou then the son of god?
of whom the foretellynges of the prophets do make mention? To this question
does Jesus in such wise tempre his answer, that he neither would deny
himself to be that he was, nor give unto them any occasion or matter falsely to
lay to his charge, nor yet as touching himself show any spyce or point of
arrogancy. For the Lord had more mind each where by his acts and deeds to
declare his divine nature of godhead that was in him, Ye say I am.
then in words to profess it, or take it upon him. He therefore in this wise
shaped his answer: Ye say that I am: after an humble and lowly sort giving
a by knowlage, that the thing which they demanded in manier and form of a
question, as a thing doubtful, might with as few words as they used, by only
alteryng the manier of pronunciacion, be spoken in a plain affirmacion that so
it was. But they iudgeing thissame to be a cause sufficient enough wherefore to
accuse him of blasphemy, (then the which crime there was none other among the
Jews more worthy death) said: Why do we yet still require witness? What node
we any ferther wytnes?
we our own selves have heard a manifest blasphemy out of his mouth. Upon
this verdite did all the whole coumpainy quickly agree, as men that had before
decreed by any title (whatsoever it were) to put Jesus to death.

The.xxiii. Chapter.

When they had found out a cause (as to theimselues appeared) fit enough to put
him to death: it remained that they might remove also the envy and displeasure
of his death from themselves, and lay it on others. Whereupon they thought it
best to shift him over from themselves into Pilate the lieutenauntes hands, to
be arayned before him, to the intent he might seem to had been put to death,
not by the Jews but by the Gentiles.

Wherefore all the counsel with the multitude also whom they had drawn to
the partakyng of their wicked deed, arise up altogether and bring Jesus to
Pilate the Lord president and lieutenaunte of Iewry. For he, though he were no
Jew himself, yet was an head officer there under the Emperor. And here first
of all the Jews do deliver to the Gentiles and alienate from themselves their
Messiah being sent of God to them. The Gentiles receive him and wurship him
when he was commended and betaken to them. The Lord was already condemned by a
foreiudgement in the counsel of the Jews, with who^, any pretense or color
were it never so slendre did suffice, as with me^ that with rageyng madness
thirsted the death of the innocent. But because at the benche of a Pagane and
heathen judge, there was more equity in ministryng of justice, then in the
court of the Jews, it was necessary to have forged witnesses, which should
lay many and great crimes to his charge: We found this fellow peruertyng the
people. etc.
who alone of all creatures was clear from all crime. The beginning of their
accusacion was of this sort. We found and took this fellow with the manier,
as he was subuertyng our nation. For he forbade yt any tribute should be paid
to the Emperor: and in all his talk he has avouched himself to be Messiah
the king. These two crimes they thought they had gaily well devised, and that
the same crimes should excedyng greatly move the mind of the Lord deputy, for
that as well the one as the other of them, comprised a spice of high treason
against Caesar. So naughtily do these most shameless crafty forgers of lies
assault the verity evangelical. For what can be devised more shameless
then such lies as these? Jesus before that time, when a piece of coin was
showed unto him, had made answer in this manier. Give and pay ye unto Caesar,
such things as belong unto Caesar, and to god, such things as belong unto god.
And to be made a king, whereas it had before been willyngly offreed him by the
Jews of their own mocion, he would none of it, but fled and ran away from
them to auoydeit. And as for being the Messiah he had also in very factes and
deeds before that time declared himself to be the same. Wherefore, if he had
affirmed and avouched himself to be the Messiah, yet ought not they to have
laid that matier to his charge as a crime, except they had first openly proved
that such things as the Prophets had foresayed concerning Messiah did not
agree ne serve to be spoken of him. The hope that they had to put him to a
foil and an overthrow, was in the great noumbre of such a multitude being
conspyred together against him, and in that Jesus whom they had accused, was
altogether destitute and fredeles, and finally the judge being as they supposed
a man of no godliness at all. Pilate, although he was a wurshipper of idolles,
yet being a man of much more equity and conscience then the priests of the
Jews, wynked at the first article of the accusacion, which concerned, that
tribute ought not to be paid unto Ceasar, and made as though he herd it not:
partly because he smelled and well apperceyued that it was but a forged
matter, and partly because it was no new thing for that point to be
reasoned and disputed of among the Jews, for so much as all the whole sect
of the Phariseis, thought that a people peculiarly and specially chosen, and
dedicated unto God, ought not to pay any tribute to heathen nations. But of the
article concerning to be a king, And Pilate opposed him saying: Art thou ye
king of ye Iewes^
he questioned with Jesus, in whom he saw no spyece ne lykelyhode of any
worldly reignyng or of being a king: he was but one sole person, his
apparel, his countenance, all the behaueour of his body, showed all tokens of
humility and symplenesse. Wherefore the president, when he had heard the
accusers, took him aparte and asked him whether he were the king of Jews.
Than Jesus answered: so thou say. For the lord did evermore so moderate his
aunsweres, that both he might approve his innocence, and yet not labor to
escape from condemnacion and judgment, forasmuch as he was determined to
dye. He was the king of Jews, and that point it was not congruente for him to
say nay unto: but an other kind of reign and kingdom it was that he went
about to recover to himself and his father. After the divine nature of his
Godhead he was the king of al things, of which divine nature Pilate suspected
ne thought no such thing at all in him: and as touching the reygne and
kingdom evangelical, the said Pilate had no understanding, forasmuch as he
was a man ignoraunte of the law and of the Prophets, saving that he had
heard, that there was looked for of the Jews, one Messiah their king
whatsoever he was, he could not tell whom: the which rumor he being a man
nothing at all supersticious, passed not much upon. Therefore although he
understood not the answer of Jesus, yet being not ignoraunte of the Jews
malice, and gatheryng the sobrenesse and humility of Jesus even by his veraye
countenance: he came forth to the bishops of the Jews and the multitude being
there gathered in a clouster together. Than said Pilate. etc. I find no fault
in him
I have (said he) examined this party of such faults as have been laid to
his charge, and I find none offense in him. But they as men knowing in their
own consciences what and how they had done: where they were not able with
evident profes to convince him, and to get the ouerhande of him, they set out
the throat, and made an open outcry against him, linking together crimes upon
crimes, and lies upon lies as thick as could be. Nay ferther more (say they) a
sedicious fellow he is, he thoroughly moves and persuades the people all
Iewrye over with his doctrine, beginning at Galilee and so all the way even
till he was come to this very city. This same forsooth is the special crime
and fault that is alleged and laid against euangelical verity, that it
makes co^mocions and sedicio^s in the people, when it is the deuelish sort of
men that insourgeth and reyseth garboyle against the verity, which they
deadly hate and cannot abide. Such tumultuous garboyle is not of right to be
imputed to the true preachers of the gospel, but to the incurable malice of
such persons as have more desire to have the holsom truth vttrely oppressed
and overwhelmed, then to lay aparte the disease of their malicious hertes. For
none otherwise does the doctrine of the ghospel trouble the people, but as a
medicine of physycke does grutche or stiere the body. For except there be
first a stieryng and a roumbleyng in the body, it must needs wholly peryshe
altogether.

This accusacion forasmuch as it moved Pylate but a little or nothing, for he
saw that the wholle mattier was dooen by a conspyracie of the chief rewlers
and certain others of the people, which were consenters and helpers forewarde
to the malice of the same head men to say as they said, he was veraye desirous
and earneste to remove both the priesoner and also his accusers, to the
examinacion and trial of an other judge, to the end that in case he might not
be hable to deliver Jesus, yet at leastwise himself, for his part, might be
rid and despeched of the cause. He quickly took an occasion of this one
little word, Galilee, of the which country Herod was Tetrarche or prince.
He therefore demanded whether Jesus was one of Galilee, it was answered that
he was a Galilean, because emongst the common people he was believed to be a
Nazarite, He sent him to Herod. etc.
for he had been brought up there in his childehoode and had afterward led
most part of his years there. Therefore as soon as Pylate perceived* that to
sit in judgment upon the priesoner did belong unto Herod, he shiefted him
over to Herod, who at that time (as it chanced) was at Jerusalem, When
Herod saw Jesus, he was excedyng glad.
howbeit all this whole matter too was wrought and doe^ by the dispensacion of
the wisdom and ordeinaunce of God, to thend that the Lord Jesus might bring
with him a testimony of his innocence from all the benches, and courts of
justice there: and that the malice of the bishops, Scribes, and chief headmen
might be the better manifested unto the world. Herod, when he saw that
Jesus was brought unto him, was glad of that sight. For the man had of long
time been with child to have a syghte of Jesus, of whom he had heard so many
things. And he verayly trusted that it would now come to pass, Than he
questioned with him.
that Jesus would before his face show some miracle, such as he had heard
very many to had been wroughte in other places by him. Wherefore he questioned
with Jesus of many things, as one desierous to geat out many things out of
Jesus: not to the end himself might be made the better man thereby, but to
satisfy his own curious fansye that he had to know things. For none other
things it were that he inquired of Jesus, but such as he would have asked of
some Magian, (that is to say) some cunnyng man that had a sight in the
priuities of Philosophy, and in the mystical conclusions of nature: but Jesus,
who was not come to serve the fa^sie and lust of a wicked prince, but to
procure health unto al creatures, made him none answer at all, But he
answered him nothing.
teaching us in the mean season, that sometime the word of god is not to be
uttered when it is evident that the persons are unworthy and unmeet to hear
it. But the bishops all this while, and the scrybes follow their matter
earnestly and call upon it, and do eagrely lay to his charge before Herod, as
me^ very fore fearing that Jesus, who was tha^ arrained, might by some means
escape. But yet Herod although he were a wicked king, yet was he nothing at al
moved with these accusacions, as one that well apperceiued all that ever was
dooen or intended, to had arisen and proceeded of envy. But thinking it
sufficient to despise him of whom he was despised, he clothed Jesus in the way
of mockage in a white garmente (for that was than the guise and manner of going
of kings and Emperoures) and so sent him back again to Pilate. And Herod
with his me^ of war despised hi^. etc
This reproach had the lord taken at Herodes hands being a prince of a gross
wit and brain, and of his armed guard, being like men, like master,
according to the proverb. For among men of such a sort, a fellow that can go
or dance on a rope, orels one that has the feate to play a iuggelyng cast,
shall sooner have praise and thank, the^ a sincere preacher of the gospel.
For such persons have no mind ne will, but either to have pleasure and
delectacion showed them, orels to learn such things as may serve to the
maintenance of their tyranny. Yet not withstanding in the mean time, Herodes
civility did condemn the wickedness of the Bishops and the Scribes, and did
quitte Jesus also, seeing he condemned him not to death being accused before
him, and making no answer to the offenses which were laid to his charge. It
was in the mean time a thing highly to the contentacio^ of Herod, that Pilate
showed him so much honor as to send Jesus unto him to have a sight of:
Whereupon from that time forewardes, amity and friendship grew between Herod
and Pilate, whereas before there had been variaunce between the^. But a wicked
and ungodly friendship it is, that is made by the injury of the truth
evangelical.

When Pilate saw that ^he prisoner was sent back again from Herod, and that
his purpose had not come to such effect as he had assayed to bring it, he
begoon of a judge to become a spokesman for Jesus: and calling together the
bishops, the Scribes, the chief men, and the commons that came at their
tails: he spoke after this sort to them. Ye have here of your own minds
brought this man before me, as one that withdraws your people from the
obedience of the Emperor and of your laws, and I here in your presence have
dooen what I can to boulte out the truethe of him with examinyng and askyng
diverse questions of him: neither do I find him culpable in any of these
crimes which ye accuse him of. The selfsame thing has come to pass with
Herod the which can judge better in these mattiers then I, forasmuch as he
is a man skilled in your laws. In consideracion whereof also I did put over
this matter to be judged and tried in his court, who if he had found him
guilty, would not have let him escape. Now because he has not found in him
any offense worthy of death, he being contented with a light punishment,
has no more but given the man a mock, as one veraylye ^ui^ing him from all
daungier of death. Wherefore it is best, that we also follow the equity of
Herod. I will chastise the manne with some lesser punishment then death, and so
let him go. This did the lord presidente, trusting that the furious rage of
the Jews would assuage when they had seen Jesus put to so many reproaches, and
so scourged. When Pylate could do no good this way neither, but saw the
madness of the Jews to be the more set on fire thereby: he devised also an
other cast how to deliver Jesus. It was a custom every year once amongst
the Jews, that the lord President (because of their high solemnity of that
feastfull day, which was than at hand) should leat go by his pardon and
releasse unto the Jews one of their offenders, whom they would ask. Therefore
the president preventing their askyng, put it to their choice whether of the
two they would have pardoned and realeassed unto them, Away with him, and
deliver us Barrabas. etc.
Jesus, or else Barabas. This Barabas was a great robber, and a notable fellow
by reason of his mischeuous deeds, in that he had stiered up a sedicion in the
city, and had slain one of the tounseme^ and had for that offense been cast
into prieson. And because the lieutenaunte right well knew him to be a fellow,
whom all the whole city hated, he trusted that it would have come to pass,
that they would sooner have suffered Jesus to be let go, who had done much
good to many people, then this manne which was a distourber of the public
peace and tranquillity: But the bishops and their adherentes were in such a
rage that they desired to have Barabas releassed unto them, and Jesus to be
hanged upon the cross, the which kind of death, like as it was most grievous
because of the long peine, so was it accoumpted also most shameful at that
time. So ferfurthe did the Jews leave no kind of cruelnesse vnministred to
Jesus. But it pleased the wisdom of God, that Jesus the fountain and autour
of all glory, should be had in so great contempt, that a sedicious murdreer
should be preferred before him, because we should not despair if we at any
time for the name and doctrine of Christ, be despised of such as love this
world. When Pylate perceived yt he could do no good this way neither, he
moved them yet once again prouyng if he could by any means mytigate their
stomakes and deliver Jesus being innocent. But they cried, saying: Crucify
hi^ Crucify him.
But they being eftsoon the more stiered to wrath, sing this furious song*
Crucify him, Crucify him. Yet did not Pilate so give place to their clamor
and crying neither: but attempted the third time to pacifye them, saying I am
a judge, I have no title at all against innocents neither can I put a man
to death in whom I can find no crime death worthy. And what has this man
committed or offended why he should dye? I find i^ (...)
I have straightly examined him, and no cause can I find in him to be punyshed
with death. If there be any small offense, I will thus much do for your
minds sakes: I will punish him, and give him a sharp rebuke, and so let him
go. But they frowardly still made a striuyng against this equity of the
judge, not with prouffes, And they cried with loud voices etc. that he might
be crucified.
but with furious and mad outcries, requiring that Jesus might be crucified,
and Barrabas leat go. And when the president had assayed all possible ways
and means, and perceived that they cried out still more and more, he called
for water to wash his hands, and testifiyng the innocency of Jesus, and
condemnyng the froward maliciousness of the Jews, he gave sentence of death
against Jesus, not after his own mind, but after the wilful arbitrament of
the Jews, who would needs have Jesus put to death, being the autour of life
and health, and releassed unto them Barrabas a sedicious murderer, whom they
preferred before Jesus. And as for Jesus, he delivered unto them to do such
execucion upon him, as themselfes would.

After that they had used all kind of opprobriousnes and villainy against him,
to satisfy their hatered, they clothed him again with his own garments, to
the entente he should the better be known of the people, and brought him
forth toward the place of execucion, bearing his own cross himself as the
manner there was. And as they were going thitherward they met by chance with
one Simon a man of Cyrene as he was cu^myng from his ferme. And upon him,
whether he would or would not, they laid the Lords cross, to the intent that
Jesus might go before, and he bear his cross after him: not to the intent to
spare Jesus, or to show him any favor: but that they might with the more
spedie dispeche accomplish the thing that they went about. But in the mean
time by gods providence there was a figure procured of the church to be
afterward gathered of the Gentiles, which did willingly enbrace the cross of
Jesus, and followed the steps of his fete. There followed Jesus also a great
multitude of the people, both men and women, which while the priests and
Scribes reioysed, Ye daughters of Jerusalem weep not for me but weep for
yourselfes.
did on their parts make much wailing and lamentacion for the death of the
innocent. For nothing else it was that they being poor folks and men of peace
could do against the wicked conspiracy of the great me^. But Jesus, who would
not have his death to be a thing of lamentacion, but of glory: neither would
have it to be bewailed, but wurshypped, (as the which he took upon him
willingly for the rede^pcion of all the whole world) willed them to refrain
their uncomely lamentyng, although it proceeded and came of a godly affeccion.
Ye daughters of Jerusalem (says he) bewail not me, but bewail your own
cause and your childrens, for the death of an innocent is not to be lamented,
but the confusion of the^ is to be lamented, who for their heinous wicked acts
shall both here be punished with pieteous plagues and affliccions: and
afterward also be adjudged to peines everlasting. For so miserable distress
and extremity does there hang over this region: that men shall call those
women happy, which never bare any children, and the wombes happy which never
brought forth fruit, and the pappes happy which never gave suck. For ye
natural kindness of the mothers is more grieved with their childre^s
troubles, the^ with their own. Now they rejoice as though they had done some
noble great act: but than, wha^ the time of gods vengeance shall come, there
shall so great fear of mischifes which be at hand, come in their minds, that
they shall say to the mountains, ouerwhelme us: and to the hills, cover us:
for if they do this in a grene tree, what shall be done in a dry and withered
tree? By this derke sentence the Lord did testify his imcomparable innocence,
that he alone of all me^ was not corrupt with any rotto^nesse of vice or of
inordinate desires: but altogether flourishing and continually budding with all
kind of virtues. That if their malice did show such exau^ple of cruelnesse
against a man altogether faultlesse: what punisheme^t ought they to have which
being wholly corrupted with naughty affeccio^s, could by no means be brought
to any honesty?

With this pomp did our prince and king go forth toward his triumph. There
were also led to execucion with him two other offenders which were condemned
with him, but not for the same matter. And this thing was also a matter procured
by the Jews to the entente they might bring him in the more slaundre and
infamy among the comme^ people, in that he was matched with such companions.
And there were two ill dooers led with him to be slain.
There was also pieked out thereunto a place, which by reason of continual
execucion of offenders, was a place of slau^dreous name, and of mortal blood
spilling, named of the thing self, Golgotha, because it was white with the
skulles and bones of folks that had been there put to death. In such a place
tha^ was Jesus crucified in ye mids betwixt two thieves as though he had been
as diepe in as they, and partaker of their offense, forasmuch, as he was
partaker of their punishment. But whatsoever thing the malice of the Jews
could devise to the shame and reproach of the Lord Jesus, all that did he turn
to his own glory and to our health. For he that being innocent does of his
own will submit himself to save men, unto the more worldly shame he
humbles himself, so much the more glory does he deserve both before God and
before man also. Thus did it please the wisdom of God, to the end he might by
this so notable an exaumple, pluck down our pride which desire to have laud
and commendacion of men, yea for our evil deeds too. Now Jesus being on
height, and lifted up into that watch tower or beako^ place out of the which
he would call all things home unto himself, willing to show a most perfect
exaumple of patience incomparable, whereas being innocente, and one that had
so many ways done good, he had so many harms and peines, so many kinds of
open worldly shame, so many mockes and skornes ministered unto him, where also
hanging on the cross (which thing does make even very mourdreers to be
pietied) they gave him such bittur words of reuilyng, as it were more
grievous for a man to abide, then to suffer death, yet is he so far from
auengeyng himself, and so far from railyng on them again, that he prayed
his father for the same persons at whose hands he was ungoodly and shamefully
handled: Father (says he) forgive them, for they know not what they do.
Thissame verayly was that holy prayer of our bishop on the aultare of the
cross, offreyng up once for ever in sacrifice the paschall lamb for the
redemption and health of the whole world. Neither was his prayer without
condign effect. For many of the same persons, which through ignorance were
doers in nailyng the Lord on the cross, when they afterward knew the truth
by mean of the Apostles preaching, professed the name of him that had been
crucified. Howbeit the malice of the Phariseis also was not altogether without
ignorance: but that was such gross ignorance, as does not deliver ne
discharge them from offense. For they might have lacked that ignorance and
error, if inordinate affeccions and desires, which they were led by as
bondseruau^tes, had not let them. But even among these some there were,
which did of a like mind or zele persecute the Lord, as Paul did persecute the
church of God. Here if thou consider (most ientill Theophilus) the most
perfect innocence of Jesus, the most great goodness of the same Jesus,
toward all creatures, the most high virtues of his mind, in which beyond
comparion he excelled al others: and again on the contrary part, if thou
set before thine iyes and behold, the hatred, the railyng the reproaches, the
guiles, the trains, the accusacions, and the kind of death that the
wiekednesse of the Jews put him unto: and should hear him upon the very
cross in the mids of their reuilyng words praying his father not to take
vengeance, but to forgive the weorkers and doers of so heinous a deed: shall
not such an one seem unto thee to be a very shameless person, which
professing himself a disciple of Christ, will go about to be avenged of a
sinner, seeing he is a sinner himself, yea although he have with a great
injury and displeasure been occasioned and provoked thereunto? Than how far
do such persons unnaturally swerue from this exaumple of Christ, as for a
light word of reproach will draw their sweordes, ready to thrust it in their
neighbors heart? how far also from this exaumple of Christ are such
persons as not digestyng a tauntyng word any thing stubbernely or proudely
spoken against them, do shake whole cities, whole kingdoms, with pestilente
blouddie wars, and enforce whole nations to the wilful effusion and spilling
of one an others blood? But let not us once move our iyes from this exaumple:
let us behold and follow our king Christ, subdueyng upon the cross all the
power of the tyranne Satan, and vanquishing all the puissaunce of this world,
and triumphing of all powers as many as auaunce themselfes against the truth
of the gospel, which truth it behooves not any otherwise to get the
victory, ne any otherwise to triumph, then under the standarde of her own
prince which is Christ. Let us behold our bishop Christ with an effectual
sacrifice pourgeyng and puttyng away the sins of all the world, of all
nations and of all times both past and to come, and suffreing punishment in his
own body for all men, so that the thing which he freely offreeth unto us,
we will with sincere faith receive and accept, as men acknowlagyng our
vnrighteousenesse and enbracing his unspeakable goodness toward us. Whither
do thou turn thy face away thou unhappy and miserable sinner? Our Lord
cries, father forgive them, and thou being fallen in despair of thy self,
do thou either address to hang thy self as Judas did, or else art thou an
heaper of sins upon sins? There is no cause why thou should from
hencefurth fear the power of Satan: Christ has gotten the victory of him:
and to thy behoufe has he gotten the victory. From on high upon the tree of
the cross, where he may be seen of all nations, he lovingly bids us come
unto him. The three angles or arms of the cross do a far of call lovingly
as well unto Asia, and Europe, as also to Afrike: and bids them come to the
partaking of everlasting health. Jesus ferthermore hanged naked upon the cross,
because he would not have any thing of this worlds, forasmuch as he was in
executyng an heavenly sacrifice: teaching us by a very right exaumple of a
true matier in deed, how pure affeccions, and how clear from the desire of
all worldly things, evangelical bishops ought to have. In the mean time the
soldiers that crucified him (as though he should not have risen again)
castyng lottes, did part and divide the lords clothes emongst themselves. And
they parted his raymente. etc.
For this was in manier of a reward for their wicked service. It was Jesus
will and pleasure, that this being as a spoil taken from him, should remain
with the soldiers: but with us, being professors of his name, he would no
point of any carnalitie of his to remain, to thentent we should now love him
in spirit. So even at this present day also his clothes be with us, like as
he does dayelye hang upon the cross to us and for our behoufe. For all
things of his, are ours: but the same must be according to the spirit. In this
wise therefore the priests, the Scribes, the Phariseis, and the chief of the
people together with the soldiers which had done the execucion of crucifying
Jesus, do skorne him hanging on the cross as one being brought to confusion,
and as a man destitute of all hope, castyng him in the teeth that whereas the
report had goen that he had helped many an one with his miracles, he was now
not hable to save himself. He has saved others (say they) now leat him be a
salueour to himself, He saved other men, let him save himself. etc.
at least wise in case he be thatsame Christ, that he has bosted himself to
be, and in case he be thatsame derely beloved and chosen son of God, whom he
has in his talk avouched that he is. Such words as these, did the chief
rewlers cast out against him in hearing of the people, that was wont to wondre
at the miracles of Christ, to thentent they might turn the minds of the
said people away from him. Yea and ferthermore they do by their words
drown and utterly wype away from him all his authority every whit of it,
proving and (as it were) co^uincing by the matier self and case as it stood,
that he was neither the Messiah, neither the son of God, whom he had openly
taken upon himself to be, except he would come down from the cross. But the
health and safegarde of the world did not consiste in cummyng down: but in
his continuyng and thoroughly enduryng to the end. And the same enduryng to the
end was of more weight and force with Jesus, then the opprobrious and reuilyng
words of the chief headmen.

self and us. But the other answered and rebuked him, saying: Fear thou not
God, seeing thou art in the same damnacion? We are righteouslye punished, for
we receive according to our deeds, but this man has dooen nothing amysse.
And he sayede unto Jesus: Lord remember me, when thou come into thy kyndome.
And Jesus said unto him: Uerayly I say unto thee, to day shall thou be with
me in paradyse. But the soldiers, a gross kind of men, and partly ignorant
of the Iewishe religion, and partly despisers of it, skorned Jesus because it
was reported that he had challenged to be king over the Jews: moved thereto
doubtelesse by the exaumple of the chief of the Jews nation. And the same
soldiers reachyng up vineagre unto him in the way of mockage, said: If thou
be that same king of the Jews, show thy power quickly and deliver thy self
from this daungier. But Jesus in all the premises showed a most perfect
exaumple of myldnesse and patience, holding his peace at al their opprobrious
words. There was also a superscripcion or poisee written on the top of the
cross directly over his head, in Greek, in Latin, and Hebrewe letters, that
it might the better be read of all nations. And a sup^^scripcion was writt^
over him.
This is the king of the Jews. And this also was veraily thought and believed
to have been done for a mock. And yet was not all this enough neither. The one
of the malefactors that hanged hard by Jesus side, rayled against him from the
cross that he hanged on, saying: If thou be thatsame Christ the salueour of
the world, now save thy self and us also. But the other these hangyng
likewise on his cross, consyderyng the meruaylous great meekness of Jesus,
blamed and rebuked his fellow which suffered the same peynes of hangyng that
himself did (because they had both committed one offense,) saying: Thou, if
thou have in thee no reverence toward men, ne no shame of the world, at
leastwyse thou ought to fear god, for speaking such opprobrious words
upon one that must here dye, But the other au^swered, and rebuked him saying.
etc.
especially seeing that thyselfe do suffer the same punishment. Even
thatsame one thing alone ought to have staighed and bridled thee from raylyng,
although he were an eguall offender with us. Now a great diversity there is
between his case and ours. We suffer punishment for our offenses, he dies an
innocente, and double inhumanitie it is, to rail both upon one that must dye,
and also upon an innocent. This testimony did the these on the cross give
unto Jesus, that his innocence might on every side be testified. And the same
these immediately turnyng himself to Jesus, said: Lord remember me when thou
come to thy kingdom. A marvelous faith of this thief, which when he saw
Jesus hangyng on the cross, and at the point of dying, himself also assured
to dye on the same place, And Jesus said: to day shall thou be with me in
paradise.
yet asked health of Jesus as of a king. Now Jesus who was both dumme and
deaf at all reuilyng words, is not deaf nor dumme to a man askyng help
with assured faith and trust in him. I make thee sure of this (says Christ)
this present day shall thou be with me in paradise: boubtlesse promising him
to have rest and refreashyng immediately as soon as this punishment that he
was than suffreyng, were over past. How happy a thing it is to be evermore
joined with Christ, who in all places and times saves me^, if evangelical
faith be present.

When the Centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying: Uerayly,
this was a righteous man. And all the people that came together to that sight,
and saw the things which had happened, smote their breasts and returned. And
all his acquayntaunce, and the women that followed him from Galile, stood a
far of beholding these things. And now it was well nigh the sixte hour of
the day, that is to say, even much about noonetyde (for so do the Jews
rekon:) from this hour of noonetyde, at which time of the day the sun is
woonte to be most hot and to shine most brightest of all: there came
soodaynly a great derkenesse over all thatsame country about Jerusalem, and
so continued till the nynth hour, that is to say, till three of the clock
afternoon. For the sun detesting and abhorryng such great iniquity of men,
did hyde his face at such time as he should be put to death, who was the light
of the world. The earth also did quake, stones brake a soondre, and every
part of nature trembled at so horrible a deed of cruelty. Ferthermore the
veil of the temple, which parted the inner holy place (which they called
Sanctum sanctorum) from the other part of the temple, rented quite a soondre
in twoe parts, no man stieryng it, showing openly that the shadows and
ceremonies of the Jews, should now cease, after that this sacrifice was once
accomplished, which alone was sufficient to pourge and cleanse the sins of
all times both past and to come. But Jesus, when he had with a loud cry
said: Father, I commend my spirit into thy hands: yielded up the ghost.
So that it might be euidente to all men, that he did not fainte as others are
wont to do, the strength of their bodies by little and little consuming away,
but that byanby after a strong stretche or cry, and after words distinctely
pronounced, he willingly, (as ye would say, When the Centurion saw. etc. the
glorified God. etc.
) and of his own accord gave up the ghost. This thing did the Centurion well
apperceiue and mark, who purposely stood hard by the cross, that no man
should take them down alive from the tree. And of this man also had Jesus a
testimony of his innocence, for he glorified God, that he had showed so great
power in him, and said: Uerayly this man was righteous: openly condemning the
unrighteousness of the Jews. For whosoever pronounces him an innocent that
is condemned, makes him an offendour that has condemned the same. All the
other coumpanie of them, who (as the common guise is) had come to see the
execucion (and in deed a great many more then would else have come, partly the
favor, and partly the hatred of Jesus, had drawn thither) when they had seen
the things which had fortuned, returned home knockyng their breasts, partly
for sorrow that a man so innocente and a doer of such good deeds had been so
ungodly entreated: and partly for fear of the stroke and vengeance of God,
which they knowing themselfes culpable in their own conscience, did of the
strange tokens that they had seen, mistrust and deem to hang over them. For
the same manne whom in his life time they had seen of low and poor degree,
and a man none other like but to be contemned: the same do they see even at his
dying hour, a man of great power, insomuche that all the elements of this
world were shaken and disordred ^ut of their course. Here eftsoon, o
Theophilus, mark thou one other po^^^^ that there was at all times more grace
found in the Gentiles, then in the Jews, who took unto them the laud of
devotion toward God, and of holy conversation above all others. The Centurion
glorifieth God: the Jews do no more but fear his stroke, And all his
acquaintance and ye weomen that followed him from Galile etc.
being made afearde with things of woondre, whereas with so many benefits
they could not possibly be won. Ferthermore they that were of Jesus kynred,
or familiare with him in his life time, stood a far of beholding what was
done, and durst not for fear come nerer. Emongst these were also the women,
which, for desire and good will to minister things necessary to him and to
his disciples, had followed him from Galile, as witnesses and beholders of those
things which were done. And the same being now destitute of all hope, did
nothing else but mourn and make lamentacion for him.

It being therefore by many evident tokens assuredly well to be seen and
known, that the lord was undoubtedly dead, lest any man might find some
point of cauillacion, either that he was not a very natural manne in deed,
orels that he was not veraily dead: behold, there comes in a man of his own
free offer, by whom the lords burial might be executed and accomplished,
which burial Jesus pleasure was should be clenly and honorable. His life had
been mild and low without bearing any part, his death had been a thing of
much effect, his burial was magnificent, and his resurreccion glorious. So
than even at the very hour, even as God would, comes in willingly of his
own free offer, a certain man named Joseph, borne in Aramathia a city of
Iewry, a good man and a just, and one of the noumbre of them that looked for the
kingdom of God. This man, although he were one of the chief men of that nation
(for he was a noble senator and a rewler) yet had he never consented to the
counsel and deeds of the priests, the scribes, and the head me^ of the
people, although for fear of their power which hated Jesus, he durst not
openly profess or acknowlage the good will and zele of his heart toward
Jesus. For as yet they had not given unto them boldness, by the holy ghost,
that all things despised, they might have the power openly to profess the
name of Jesus. The other disciples therefore being drieuen away for fear, only
Joseph together with Nicodemus, dares take in hand the office of burying the
Lord: whether it were because the favor of men toward them that be good,
does after the death of the same encreace more and more: orels because the
said Joseph judged ye envy of the Jews against Jesus to be now saciate with
his death. Wherefore he comes unto Pilate to whom he was a man well known by
reason of his nobility, and asked of him ye body of Jesus. But Pilate would
not give it him before he had perfect knowlage by the Centurio^ that he was
thoroughly dead. Than Joseph toke^ the body, and after it was taken down from
the cross* and enbaumed all over with sweet odoriferous savors, he wound it
up in a fine shete, having in the mean time no hope at all of his
resurreccion, of the which Jesus had briefly in few words, given knowlage
but a little before unto his disciples: but in such wise had he done it, that
they the same disciples better remembered it, then believed it. And because they
had an opinion that Jesus was a good man, and put to death without a cause:
they thought to honor the remembrance of him with a magnificente buiriall.
Whereupon they laid the corpse in a toumbe which stood in a garden platte
thereby, hewe^ out of a whole piece of rocketstone eue^ as it grew, in the
which there had been never any body buried before: These things, whereas at
that present they seemed to be dooen by mere chance: were yet altogether dooen
by the providence and ordeynaunce of God, that the Jews might not quarrel or
make any cauillacions, that the toumbe having an hole made in it, the body had
been taken a way or changed.

When these things were in doing, it was the day of preparacion, that is to
say, the eane of that high Sabbath: and it was called with them, parasceue,
because that upon that day they prepared al things which were necessary the to
solemn keeping of the Sabbath day, that should be on the morrow, to the
intent they might not be compelled by doing of any bodily labor, to break
the rest of the Sabbath day. Now the women which had a far of looked upon
Jesus on the cross, followed him to his buirial, because they would not be
ignorant where the body of Jesus was laid, and in what place, or with what
manner of orderyng it was laid: to the end that they might know it when they
should come to it again. These things being diligently vieued and marked,
they return home again and prepared spices, odours, and oyntementes, wherewith
they might afterward dress the body of the Lord, although it had been now
already soso, as it might be, anointed over with myrthe by Nicodemus. But the
Godly devotion of the women minded to put some other more precious thing to the
lords corpse. But the lord therefore had before suffered an allabastre of
precious oyntemente to be powered upon him, because he would nottary for
these women's sweet oyntementes now at this time, whose devout diligence
nevertheless auayled to confirm the belefe of his resurreccion. For when they
seek him as dead to be anointed and spyced, they have due knowelage that he is
alive. Now after the sun set of the same day until the eauenyng of the
next day following, they had rested according to the prescripcion of the law,
because it was not standing with Gods precepte that they should do any
bodily labor on the Sabbath day. Than after the sun was set, they
finished that they had begoonne before in preparyng of the oyntementes and
spices. It the selfsame time also the Lord kept his Sabbath, restyng in his
grave, after that he had before on the said day of preparacion executed and
accomplished the work of our redemption: because we should understand that
mankind was restored by the same manne, by whom it had been created. He
finished the making of the world on the sixte day, and on the seventh day he
rested from his work: the same lord finished the redemption of the world on
the sixth day (which is the parasceue day:) and rested in the grave. He rested
from working (as touching his humain body) until the eight day did shine, the
which eight day the Jews know not, but the Christians do wurshippe. The
eight day is the day of i^mortalitie: in the which, rest and werinesse,
weorke and idleness shall not by course enterchaungeably the one succeed the
other, but they shall be in everlasting gladness: neither shall the day follow
the night and the night the day again by course, but continual and
everlasting light shall shine to the iyes of the godly.

The.xxiiii. Chapter.

THat the selie weomen rested from doing any weorke, was a thing given to the
solemnity of the Sabbothe. But as soon as it was lawful to return again to
workynge, the diligence of the weomen bestowed the time in watchyng after
sunnesette about a devout piece of work, but yet a work that as than
neded not. For on the day, that was first and next of all following after the
Sabbothe, that is to say, on the eight day, when all the Sabbothe day was
fully ended, even very erely in the first break of day; they make haste
unto the grave, carrying with them the spieces and sweet savors which they
had purposely prepaired, certes, to bestow this same as the last point of
honor that ever they should show unto him being now dead, whom they had
tendrely loved while he was alive, whereas yet nevertheless, And they found the
stone rolled away from the sepulcher.
they had no trust nor hope that ever he should arise again to life. Now was
the mouth of the sepulcher stopped and shut fast up with a mighty big stone,
such an one as might uneath be removed away of a good many of men. There was
also a seal set thereon, and that was a thing provided and done by the
Phariseis and the Scribes, lest some fellow might privily have stolen away
the dead body, and so sprede abroad an untrue rumoure that he was arisen to
life again, in that he could nowhere be found. There were kepers moreover set
there of the Lord lieutenauntes men. Then the weomen while they carefully
look round about how the stone might be rolled aside, they see it soodainlye
removed away, And they went in.
and a way to come to the sepulcher lying wide open for them. They took hertes
to them to enter in, devotion and love toward God had given them boldness
even weomen as they were.

When they were entered in, they find not the body of the Lord Jesus there.
When this matier had soore dismayed them, and in manier killed their veraye
hertes, because that when the stone was removed they had conceived a veraye
good hope: and yet on the other side again they were in a great marvel, how
it was possible that the grave should be empty, which they had but even
byanby before seen shut and seal^d up: soodaynly there stand hard by them
twoe Angels in form and likeness of twoe young men, with gladsome and
frendely countenance, Twoe men stood by the^ in shynyng garments etc.
and their garments glitteryng in manner of clear brightness or lightning.
Thissame very lightness and sight of the Angels had been an open semblaunt
of the triumph of an arysing again to life. And when the weomen being
thoroughly afraid with this strange sight, cast their countenance, and iyes
down upon the ground, and durst not look straight upon the majesty of the
vision, being a thing above the reach of man's nature: the said Angels with
mylde and amiable speaking unto them do ease and recoumforte the hertes of
them being astouned with that soodayne fear. O ye weomen (say the Angels)
why do ye seek him in the graves of the dead, which is a liuesman? In deed
here was he laid when he was dead: but now forasmuch as he is revived
again, he is not in grave, where the dead do rest, but he is arysen again
from death to life, and walks a liuesman among the living. He had by his own
words foreshewed that dye he should: he had foreshewed the time and also the
kind of his death: but the same had also foreshewed, that he would on the third
day return to life again. Ye believe him to be dead, because ye saw it:
believe ye also that he is arysen again to life. Remember how he spoke unto
you. etc.
For he will not in this point deceive you, which on the other part told
you truth. Has sorrow and trouble of mind made you to forget all things
that he told you of aforehande? Let it come to your remembrance again how
that of all these things which have now been dooen, he leafte not any one
point unspoken of or untold aforehande when he was yet in Galile. For he
told you before, that it was so decreed by the wisdom and ordeynaunce of his
father, that for the redemption of mankind the son of man should be
delivered into the hands of sinners, and that he should be accused, should be
beaten, and should be setfurth to receive al kinds of mocking and skorning,
and finally that being hoighced up upon the cross, he should be put to death:
but yet that he the same man should on the third day, return to life again.
Call ye the time well unto your knowlage. He was taken down from the cross
well toward the euentyde of the preparacion day, and laid here in thissame
grave: that day is rekoned for the first day from his death. All the whole
Sabbath day he rested in his sepulcher: Now is this the dayspring of the third
day, which third day, himself arising together with the same, has willed to be
gladsome and prosperous to all the whole world. After these words spoken,
the Angels vanished away from their sight.

Than the women through the Angels bringyng them in remembrance, do call to
memory the Lord Jesus words, by the which he had told aforehand unto his
disciples, as well his death as also his resurreccion. Whereupon leauyng the
monumente, they make have to the eleven Apostles, and the other disciples, who
for fear of the Jews lay in secret places here some and there some gathered
together, and had even themselves too, forgotten in manner all things that
Jesus had told them, and were now in manier in despair: and to them do the
weomen bring news what they had seen and what they had heard of the Angels.
The first weoman Eve, being deceived by the serpent, allured her housebande
Adam to do amysse: these devout weomen being taught by the Angels, do move
and exhort men to promptenesse of believing.

Therefore because the weomen kind should not evermore without any end
continue in slander and oblique for death that had issued out of them into
men: And their words seemed unto them feigned things.
the most gladsome tidinges of life restored again, doethe therehence
proceed, from whence the occasion of death has first issued. Now the weomen
which brought the first news of the premises unto the Apostles, were Marie
Magdalene the systur of Lazarus, Ioanna the wife of Chusa Herodes agent and
factour, Mary the mother of James the younger, which was also called the
systur of Mary the Lords mother, and many other weomen which in coumpany of
these were wont to go with Jesus where ever he went. But for the incredible
mat^er that they brought news of, the weomen being esteemed to be vessels
sumwhat frail, found no such regard as to be credyted among the Apostles,
whom the Lord for such consideracion suffered to be the slacker to believe,
that the assured truth of his resurreccion might by the more euidente proufes
and tokens be confy^med. Therefore what the said weomen reported of soodayne
seeing of the angels, of the stone in a momente removed from the mouth of the
sepulcher, seemed to the Apostles and disciples to be some point of dotage
such as reigns in weomen, Than arose Peter.
because that this sex of woman kind (having the conceipte of their
imaginacion somewhat infected and corrupt through the weakness of reason and
of good judgment in them) do many times believe themselfes to see that they
see not, and hear yt they hear not. And although they did not believe it to
be a mattier of truth, that the weomen reported, yet did their earnest
affirmyng of it, and standing therein, thus much avail, that Peter arysyng
from the place where he sat, ran forth to the monument: and puttyng his head
in, and lokyng before him, he fyndeth not the body, but the pieces of linen in
which the body of Jesus had been wound up, he sees liyng there aside in a
place by themselfes. And yet not so neither did he believe that the Lord was
arisen again from death to life: (so diepe forgetfulness had there taken him,
of the things which Jesus had said) but away he went from the sepulcher
meruaylyng with himself what had befallen, And departed w^^dreyng in himself.
etc.
and doubtyng whether any body had taken away the body out of the monument,
and castyng many soondry things in his mind, by whom, or of what intent and
purpose thatsame point had been dooen, that the body taken away, he saw the
linen pieces leafte behind, as things laysurely taken of from the body,
which could not without some buisinesse have been plucked of: and for that he
saw the same linen pieces not cast about at adventure here one and there one,
but handesomely laid up in their place and order, the kerchefe wherewith the
head and face of Jesus had been covered, being laid by it self aparte from
the rest.

they should not know him. And he said unto them: what manier of
communica^ions are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?
And the one of them (whose name was Cleophas) answered and said unto him:
Art thou only a straungier in Jerusalem, and have not known the things
which have chanced there in these days? He said unto them: what things?
And they said unto him: of Jesus of Nazareth which was a Prophet: mighty in
deed and word before God, and all the people: and how the high priests, and
our rewlers delivered him to be condemned to death: and have crucified him. But
we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel. And as
touching all these things, to day is even the third day, that they were
done. Yea, and certain weomen also of our company made us astouned, which
came erely unto the sepulcher, and found not his body: and came saying, that
they had seen a vision of Angels, which said that he was alive. And certain
of them which were with us, went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as
the weomen had said, but him they saw not. And so it befell, that even the
very same day, two of his disciples, unto whom the news had tofore been
reported of the sepulcher of Jesus, how it was found void without the body in
it, Two of them went that same day to a tou^e called Emaus.
(although there had no credence been given to their words) the said two
disciples leauyng the city of Jerusalem went unto a town called Emaus. This
Emaus is distaunte from Jerusalem the mountenaunce of three score furlonges (of
which eight go to a mile, so that it was from Jerusalem to Emaus, seven
miles and one half mile after that rekonyng.) And in their going on the way
they talked together of many sondrie matiers, as men commonly use to do,
namely when any sorrow or pensifenesse is in their hertes. For they were men
greatly dismayed and cast in heaviness with the Lords death, and were even
now in a manier at the veraye point of desperacion, and had cast away all
hope. But as for their talkyng was altogether about Jesus, and about all the
things which they had seen, and which they had heard in these latter days
aforegoyng. While they commoned together. etc.
For they had borne a great love toward him, as one that was a notable man
and full of beneficial goodness. And albeit that same gaye royal hope of
restoryng the kingdom of Israel was out of their minds, almost clean
forgotten: yet had they a delight with mutual talking the one with the other,
to renew the memory of him even dead as he was. For their minds being
altogether unquiet and troubled, a certain kind of slumbre (as ye would say)
had creped upon them, so that (as it were in a sleep) they bear a love
toward him, whom they could not forget. At last as they were diuising and
tellyng between themselves many things of Jesus, and talkyng many matiers of
him to and fro, the one to the other: behold he was even personallye present
there with them that they talked of. For Jesus who tofore had promised that he
would be in the mids between them, wheresoever he should find any two
persons talking together of him, did at that time even after the corporal
presence of his body also, show the thing which in spirit he never ceasseth
to do. But their iyes were holden.
So that he joined himself in coumpanye with them as a waifaryng manne, and
offered himself to keep them company on the way, but it was in a likeness to
them unknown: not that he had any other body then the verai same which he had
before his death, but for that (because it pleased Jesus so to have it,) their
iye sight had such an impediment, that they could not know him, though they
saw him corporally. Happy is that coumpanye and blyssed of Gods hand, as
often as two persons have none other talk, ne make none other serchyng out
but of Jesus. Happy are they that ever they were borne, to whom Jesus
vouchesalueth to join himself as a mate or a coumpanion. And as the Lord
Jesus has a good fancy to be present with such as talk of him: so does
Satan rejoice to be present among them which use such communicacions together
among them, as may corrupt honest behaueour, as for exaumple, of leacherie, of
falsehood, of auengeyng, of pride, of gaynes, and lu^re, of the slau^dre of the
neighbor. But for because these two men did so burn in the love of Jesus,
What manner of communicacio^s are these yt ye have one to an other? etc.
that by reason of human frailty they doubted of his promises, the Lord
for a little season deceyuyng their iyesyght sercheth out what opnion they had
of him: not for that any thing was to him unknown, but because he would
remedy their unbelief, for the better co^firming of our feith. He therefore
says: what talk is all thissame that ye two have between you, on the way as
ye go, your countenance and mood showing all the while a sorrow and
heaviness of heart? For even this thing also does commonly assuage sorrow, if
we may fortune to have any body into whose lap we may pour out the thing that
grieueth us. Yea and this one property ferthermore has man's affeccion, that
if a thing be to ons very high contentacion and delight, he thinks the same to
be unknown to no man, and that every body has a special care and regard
thereof. Much after the rate of this affeccion does the one of ye disciples
answer, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem? etc.
whose name was Cleophas: It is (says he) a thing very well known to all
me^ as many as enhabite or live at Jerusalem: and seeing that thou come out
of that city as well as we, how can it be possible, that thou alone (as it were
sum newcome stranger,) should be ignorant of these things which have been
done there now in these last days, and which no man alive but he knows
them? Than Jesus, as one couetyng to learn, where in very deed he was come to
teach, answered: What things are these ye speak of? They plainly mening
good feith, up and declare at large unto Jesus the sum of all the whole
matter, as to a stranger, and one that was ignoraunte of all that had been
done: frankely making open confession, how fer they were from having as yet any
opinion of Jesus, wurthy for his wurthinesse: and how they had clean cast
away all hope in a manner, of his arisyng again from death to life. We were
talking (say they) and telling the story of one Jesus of Nazareth which was an
excellent man, and a Prophet, mighty both in word and deed, not only before
God, to whom he was very dear beloved, but also among all the people
universal, with whom he had by his miracles and doctrine, and benefits,
purchaced and gotten most high authority. The high priests and the rewlers of
our people pursued him to death, before the lieutenaunt, and in conclusion
nailled him on the cross. Now we had conceived a certain maruaylous hope of
him, But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel.
that he should have redeemed the people of Israel, as men being utterly in
belief that he had been the Messiah which was long agon promised by the
Prophets. But his death which was both undoubtedly true, and also full of
open worldely shame, has taken away this hope from us. Ye and there had no
small hope been put in our heads, that it would so come to pass, that he would
after three days have returned again to life: but whereas he was condemned,
crucified, and buried, this very present day, is the third day sense all
these things fortuned to be done, and yet do not we see any whitte the more
of assured hope, saving that certain weme^ of the fraternity of his disciples,
have by the reportyng of certain strange news, such as never was heard of,
made us yea more astouned then we were before.

Yea and certain women also of our cou^pa^ny made us a^^ouned. etc.
For where these same women went forth before sunrisyng to the Sepulcher, they
say plainly they found not the body there, and affirm moreover that certain
Angels appeared unto them, and said that he is alive. And wha^ no man gave
credit to their report, certain of our coumpany went also to the grave to
prove whether the fond wemens tale had any truth in it. And as concerning the
grave self they found the matter to go even so as the women had made
relacion. For they found it open and empty: the pieces of linen also, and the
other things which the corpse had cast of, they found within the grave laid
up together in one of the corners. But as for himself they found him not any
where at all.

When these two disciples had by this tale tellyng, simply declared how
greatly they wauered in their minds, and how little hope they were in of the
Lords promises: than Jesus in deed does not yet suffer himself to be
known, but like some one of Jesus disciples better enfourmed and enstructed in
the matter, chydeth their dullness of capacity, and rebukes their unbelief.
O ye hard witted fellows (says he) unapt to be taught to the understanding
of scriptures, O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets
have spoken.
and of an hard heart and slow to believe so many holy sayings of the
Prophets, which they have written of Christ. Why do these things now appear
strange unto you, when they be wrought and done already, seeing that the
prophecies of the Prophets did so many hundred years past tell aforehande,
that they should afterward be done? Why do ye not confer and compare their
foretellynges with the things that have now been wrought and executed? do
not the scriptures, which have by the inspiracio^ of God been written, teach
how that it so pleased the providence of God, that Christ should suffer these
things which he has suffered, and should after such sort by an uncouth
conueighau^ce restore life by mean of death, and should by mean of the cross
recover his kingdom, and through open shame of the world should enter into his
glory? Ought not Christ to have suffered these things? etc
This world has it glory, but it is neither true glory in deed, nor yet
perpetual to endure for ever. And such persons as acquire and get the same,
they get it by vain petigrewes, tytles, richesse, bounteous geuyng, stately
port, ruffleyng in the world, yea and many times they get it from men whether
they will or no by extorte power. But Christ shall by far unlike ways and
means recover and win unto him among men, his own glory that he had before
the creacion of the world: because he will show unto all mortal men, by what
pathway they ought stoutely to break a passage unto true glory that shall
never dye.

And he began at Moses.
Where Moses has of this matter taught so many lessons, where the Prophets
have foretold so many things, are ye yet still of so gross a mind and
understanding, that ye look for your Messiah to be some captaihn wiche shall
usurp unto himself the kingdom of the world, and enter the possession thereof
with charyottes, horses, elephauntes, wild asses, armed hosts of men, with
gunnes, crossebowes, ingiens, fire, sweorde, and blood? Do ye not yet feel the
scripture to be spiritual, and the power of Messiah not to consiste in
garrisons or fortresses, by means of which the princes of this world do
either get into their hands, orels enlarge their temporal kingdoms, but
contrariwyse to consiste in virtue and power celestial?

Why do ye not rather search and try out the scriptures, which have already
foreshewed many things of Christ, and confer the same with those things
which Christ foreshewed of himself unto his disciples, and the which have
come to effect according as he had foreshewed them? By that means it shall
come to pass, that neither any thing of all these matters which have of late
be fallen, shall seem uncouth or strange: and of the things, which he
promised should afterward come, there shall be no matter that ye will conceive
mystrust of. After that the Lord had with this little fit of chidyng made
them more earnest to give better head and ear to the matter, he declared unto
them all the scriptures, which openly foreshewed that the thing should so come
to pass in Christ, which had now of late fortuned: showing that there did so
many prophecies, figures, and effects of things in fact cu^myng to pass, so
justly accord in time to gether, that it must needs be on the one side a
token of a certain exceeding great dullness, not to epsy and mark the same,
and on the other side of notable mystrustefulnesse not to believe it. And all
his process he begone out of Moses and out of the Prophets: And ente^preted
in all the scriptures which were written of him.
and after that, gatheryng out of every book of holy scripture some one point
or other, which might both enforce the credit of the things, that had to fore
already happened, and also purchase credit aforehand to the things which were
afterward to come. And all these places of scripture did he in such sort
confer one with an other, that the matter appeared clear and evident. Happy
were they that ever they were borne, who were thought worthy to hear that
heavenly teacher with lively voice expouning the same things at large, which he
had before caused to be written by the Prophets having the instinct of his own
holy spirit. I (because I am not sufficient to recite all) will make relacion
but of a certain noumbre of places gathered out of that same blissed talkyng
of Christ with the said two disciples.

Which places would God that the Jews would at leastewyse even now at last
give ear unto: and would leave looking for any other Messiah, and would with
earnest zele and affeccion embrace this man Jesus who is given to the world an
only salueour and redemer: whereby they might be saved, and might be made
free, if not from the empire of Caesar, yet at leastewyse (which is a more
blissful thing) from the tyranny of the devil: and that they might with
their captain Christ atteyne the kingdom, not of this world which is
frail and transitory, but of heaven, which knows none end. As for Moses
(said he) the Jews do in manner no less then wurship as a certain God,
because he co^ducted and brought the people of Israel out of Egypt, and
delivered unto them in deserte a law through the observing and keeping whereof
they should atteyne deliverance and safeguard, and should come to a land
flowing with honey and milk. But thissame Moses, what other thing was he, but a
certain shadow of Christ to come? For he was not the son of God, but the
servant* nor he did not in very true deed deliver the people, seeing that
they were afterward in bondage under the king of Babylon: nor he was not
utterly without sin: no nor never entered in his own person into the land,
unto the which he was a guide and captain to the people. And in case he had
entered, it had been no great matter, seeing yt there be idolatres enhabiting in
the self same land even at this present day. All these things being
understood after the flesh, do conteyne no great matter in them.

But Christ is thatsame true and right Moses, who by his own propre power
does deliver, not the Hebrews only, but also all the universal nations of
the world, as many as do put their affiau^ce in him: all such does he
deliver from the vengeance and stroke of God: he delivers them from the
tyranny of the devil: he delivers them from the derkenesse of errors: he
delivers them from the abominable bondage of sins: and when he has first
cleansed them with his own blood, he brings them forth into the fredome of
the spirit, being to them a perpetual guide and coumpanion also, until he
bring them through and past all the dau^giers of this present life, unto
thatsame heavenly land above, plenteously flowyng and rennyng over with all
kinds of bliss and felicity. He is the true Moses, who made a law ghostely
and evangelical: which law should not teach a corporal righteousness
through ceremonies and sacrifices of beasts, but should give true and perfeite
righteousness through feith and charity. And that such an one should spring
up, Moses himself foresayed. For thus speaks he in the Deuteronomie. Deuteronomy.
xviii.c.
The Lord thy God shall reise up unto thee a Prophet of thine own nation,
and of thine own brethren, as he has done me: him shall thou hear. And
forthwith even in the same Deuteronomie, the Lord confirms the promise of
Moses, saying.

Deuteronomy. xviii. d.
I shall reise up unto them a Prophet out of the mids of their brethren, like
unto thee, and I shall put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto
them all the words that I shall command and enjoin him to speak. Ye have
here the prophecy of Moses: now compare the thing with the prophecy. There
sprang up none after Moses, which has by any means eagually matched him in
authority, saving only Jesus Christ, who has in such wise resembled Moses,
that he every way far passed Moses.

He was the maker of a new testament, but the same testamente for ever to
endure. And this testamente has he consecrated, not with the blood of a calfe,
but with his own blood. He was ye maker of a new law, but it was such a
law, as should bring present health. Moses was but the ministre and servant of
God: but this Christ was his son, and came down from heaven, and taught
those things which he saw above with his father, as one having within
himself a perpetual vncessaunte power to do whatsoever his will is. Moses
upon the mountain talked with God in a cloud: Christ has proceeded and come
forth from the brightenesse of his father. Moses taught and delivered the
shadows of things: Christ taught and gave the truth. Moses did in such sort
make intercession for the sins of the people, that himself has need of an
other mediator for his own offenses: Christ being clear from all sin,
pourged and cleansed the sins of al ages and times as well past as to come.
Moses fasted fowertie days: Christ did the same, so that one might at
leastewyse by that token know him to be the second. Moses. Moses brought the
law first down from the mountain: Christ on the mountain taught the
perfeccionyng of the law, mat. v. and Luke. vi.
when he pronounced those strange beatitudes never before heard of. He taught
often times also in the temple, which is set in the mount Sion, which
thing was done according to the prophecy of Esai, that says:

The law shall come out of Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
But at what time the law of Moses was made and given, Esai. ii. a
all things were wholly replete with terrors, for to snibbe and hamper the
hardenesse of heart that reigned in the people: Christ came mild and amiable
rather then terrible, conuincing them with reason, prouokyng them with
benefits, alluryng them with meekness, offreyng himself to all men, and
ready for every manne to give them health, and ouercummyng them with paciente
suffreaunce. And such manner an one, had the holy sayings of the Prophets
before promised that he should be. For ye have read what Esai has written.

I have given him my spirit, Esai. xlii.
that he may show forth judgment and equity among the Gentiles. He shall
not be an out crier, nor lift up his voice, his voice shall not be heard in
the streets. And a bruised read shall he not break, and the smokyng flax shall
he not quench: but faithfully and truly shall he give judgment, not be pensife
nor careful, that he may restore righteousness unto the earth, and the
Gentiles also shall keep his laws. Again, the same Esai in a certain other
place makes Messiah speaking in this manner:

The spirit of the Lord God is upon me, for the Lord has enoynted me, and
has sent me to preach good tidings unto the poor: Esai. lxi.
that I might bind up the wounded hertes: that I might preach deliverance
unto the captive, and open the prieson to them that are bound: that I might
declare the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our
God: that I might coumforte all them that are in heaviness: that I might give
strength of heart unto them that mourn in Sion: that I might give, I say,
beauty in the stead of ashes, joyful oynctement for syghyng, pleasant
raymente for an heavy mind: Ye have heard what manner one the prophecy
promised that he should be, now rekon in your minds whether he came not even
such an one as he was promised. What sex, what age, what state high or low,
did he remove or put of from his beneficial goodness? not children, not
women, not Publicanes, not sinners, not harlottes.

What kind of disease did he cry fie upon or turn his face from? not lepres,
not men possessed with deiuils, not persons possessed with bloody flixes, not
folks diseased with the palsy. What could be more meke or ientyll then this
saying which ye have heard spoken of his own mouth? Math. xi.^
Come unto me all ye that labor and are laden, and I shall refreshe you: for
my yoke is sweet and my burden is light: learn ye of me, that I am meke and
low in heart, and ye shall find reaste unto your souls. What mother has
ever so loved, so suffered, and so cherished her children as he did his
disciples? Besides all this, the law of Moses neither was given to all
peoples, nor to al ages: Christ's law like as it is given unto al nations, so
that it in no age ne time be changed until the end of the world. And consider
ye in this behalf also how all points do justly agree one with an other.
First and formoste how clearly and plainly Hieremy did prophecy unto you
before, that the circumcision of the body shall cease together with the
sleaghyng of beasts in sacrifice, the solemnisyng of Sabbothes, the
obseruacion of days, the difference of meats, the fastes, the vows, and the
residue of ceremonies, which were for a season for this purpose given, that
they might be unto the Jews as figures of things spiritual. Hiere. iiii a
Plough your land (says he) and sow not among the thorns. Be ye circumcised
in the Lord, and take ye away the foreskynne of your hertes, all ye of Judah,
and all the enhabitau^tes of Jerusalem. Hier. xxxi, f
Again in a certain other place the same Prophet says: Behold the days
shall come (says the Lord) and I shall make a new league and couenaunte to
the house of Israel, and to the house of Judah: not after the tenor of the
couenaunte which I couenaunted with your fathers: and forthwith he added a
manifest difference between thatsame law being rough and impossible for any
man to bear: (which was not without good cause written in stones, which
stones did by their hardness represente the hardness of the Jews hertes:)
and between the law evangelical, by mean whereof innocence is freely offered
through faith. Hier. xxxi. f
This shall be the covenant (says he) which I will make with the house of
Israel: after those days (says the lord) I shall plant my law in the
inward parts of them, and in their hertes will I write the same. And forthwith
teaches he that the shadows also of the law shall cease as soon as the
light of the truth is showed forth.

And from thensforth shall no man teach his neighbor, nor his brother,
saying: Know thou the Lord. For all people shall know me from the least of
the^ to the most (says ye Lord) for I shall have mercy on their iniquity,
and I shall never remember their sins any more. And do not ye remember how
Christ spoke and did all things agreeable herunto, wha^ he was yet living? Did
he not manifestly denounce and give warnyng of an end, Math. xi. b Luke. ivi.
d Ihon. iiii.c
of the law, when he said? The law and the Prophets reigned until John.
The Jews wurshipped God and prayed unto him in the city of Jerusalem. But
what said Jesus to the Samaritane woman? The hour shall come and it is now
already present when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem
wurship the father, but in spirit shall they wurship him.

Math. xii a Math. ii. d Luke. vi. a
Did he not secretly without making any words, begin to abrogate the law,
when he healed on the Sabbothes, the Phariseis in vain roaring against him?
When he spoke in the defense and maintenance of his disciples against the
slaundreous querelyng of the said Phariseis at what time his disciples plucked
the ears of wheat in the corn field on ye Sabbath day? Math. ix. c. mark.
ii. e Luke. v. f
when he played the advocate for the same his disciples in a se^bleable querele
pieked against them by the same Phariseis for that they did not keep their
solemn fast? mat. viii. a mark. i. d Luke. v.c mat. ix. a mark. ii. a Luke.
i. d. e
But a great deal more, at what time he healed the lepre without any
ceremonies, and (which thing the law forbids) touched one with his hands
after he was condemned of the lepry by the priests: and at what time he did
without any remedy of the law, forgive sins unto the man possessed with the
paulsey: to the woman sinner that rushed into the Phariseis house unbidden,
while they were at diner, and to many more besides these. For ye law had
commanded burnt offreynges to be sacrificed for their sins, mat. xxvi. a
mar. iiiii. Luke. ^ii. f John. xii. a
and that any offense committed, should be pourged and cle^sed with certain
sacrifices and oblacions appointed by name. But Christ being a new reforger
of the old law, instead of burnt offreing, did substitute charity. There be
(says he) many sins forgeuen her, because she has loved much. He
substituted feith instead of sacrifice at an other time also, when he said: O
son have thou a sure feith and trust, math. xix. a mar. x. a
thy sins are forgeuen thee. Yea, and yet more manifestly also at a certain
other season did he show unto you a diversity of both laws, Luke. xvi. d
Math. v. f Math. v. g
the new, and the old: forbidding divorce, which ye law of Moses had by
permission granted: also when he forbid swearing, which the former law of
Moses had not forbidden: also when he commanded to love the enemies, whereas
the old law did permit both to hate the enemy, and also to be aue^ged on
him for any trespace. Did he not once for altogether abrogate and take away al
authority from the priests, the Scribes, and the Phariseis, in that they did
yet still hold the gross letter of the law fast in their teeth? math. xv. v
Let them alone (said he) they are blind, and guydes of the blind. And had not
the Prophets foreshewed this thing also, that things carnal, should in time
cummyng give place to things spiritual? Do ye not remember what Daniell the
Prophet does write?

That preuaricacion (says he) may be at the vttermoste, Daniel. ix. f
and that sin may have an end, and iniquity may be wyped clean away, and
everlasting righteousness may be brought in, and that the vision and the
prophecy may be fulfilled, and the holy of holyes may be enoyn^ted. When ye
hear that the prophecies are consummate and brought to their perfeite effect:
verayly ye do now understand, that such things as are already past and
done, ought not any longer to be looked for, as if they were still to come: and
when ye hear eternal righteousness, ye understand that the righteousness
of the law, which was to endure but for a while, is now abolished.

When ye hear that Messiah is to be enoynted, who is the holy of all holyes,
and he alone that makes all things holy, forsooth ye understand, that
corporal enoyntyng must cease, and the priesthood of the law together with
the oblacions and sacrifices of the same to be abrogated. For Jesus was never
enoynted with thatsame holy oyntement, which the law did very scrupulously
teach for to make, threatenyng death unto those persons, whosoever had
cou^trefeited or practiced the like confeccio^, or had applied the same unto any
secular uses. For the enoynting of the body makes nothing at all ^o the
effect or purpose of the priests, but that it was a sign of the spiritual
enoynting wherewith Christ was enoynted: according as I recited erewhyle out of
the prophecy:

The spirit of God is upon me, Esai. lxi. a
for the Lord has enoynted me. Whereunto the psalmiste David accords
speaking of Messiah: Therefore the God thy God has enoyncted thee with the oil
of gladness above all thy compiers. Psalm. xliiii. b math. iii. d mark. i b
Luke. iii, d John. i.v
What the Prophet promised, ye saw performed, wha^ Jesus was baptized in
fluime Iordane. For the holy ghost came in a visible likeness, and lighted on
the top of his head, and the voice of the father was heard, who had enoynted
his son with the oil of gladness, above the Prophets and Patriarchs, yea
and above all mortal creatures, which either in time past have been, or now
at this present be, or herafter shall be. This heavenly and spiritual enoyntyng
has set an end to the priestehood of Moses institutyng, Daniel. ix. f
which thing Daniel does forthwith clearly bring in, saying: And in the
mids of the weke, hosts and sacrifice shall faill. Neither any other thing
it was that God meant, speaking by Esai, as one whose stomach arose and stood
against their corporal sacrifices of beasts. What care I for the multitude of
your killyng of sacrifices (says the Lord?) I am full. The burnt sacrifices
of wethers, and the grease of the fat beasts, and the blood of calfes, and
lambs, and goats, I will none of. Now ferthermore Daniel, Luke. xix. f
did he not manifestly foreshewe the destruction and throwyng down of the
city of Jerusalem to gether with the Temple thereof? And did not Christ
prophecy the same unto his disciples, with weeping iyes, lamenting and bewailyng
the woeful case and extremity of the same city and people? For it grieved God
already being as he is spiritual, and made him weary to enhabite a temple made
and built up with the hands of man: He was nothing delited with the offreynges
of beasts slain in sacrifice: He found a miss and a lack of an other city,
on which thatsame name Jerusalem might truly light: he missed and wanted an
other temple mete for him to dwell in, builded of himself, consecrated and
hallowed with his own spirit: other sacrifices and oblacions, an other nation
circumcised in heart, on whom the name of Israel might truly agree. Now is
there nothing of perpetual co^tinuaunce, that may be seen with bodily iyes:
things that are not seen are everlasting, and therefore mete and semely for
God, who is eternity self never to have end. But yet these shadows of
things visible were given for a time to the gross and untrained people, to
the end they might one day in process of time by these first introduccions,
grow and proceed forward to things of the mind. But Jesus whose stomach
stood much against as well the city, as also the temple, and the nation, and
the sacrifices of the old law, does by the Prophets declare evidently
enough what manner things he wished from thensforth to have instead of these
others now rehearsed. Have ye not read what Esai wrote of the heavenly
Jerusalem?

Esai. i. g
Thou shall (says he) from hensforth be called the city of the righteous man,
the feithfull city. Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring
her home again, in righteousness. Ye hear a new buildyng of the city, which
is the church or congregation built up of living stones, the corner stone
whereof, and the foundation whereof is very Christ himself. And this is the
stone whom the prophecy of ye mistical Psalm did signify, where it says:
psalm. cxvii.c mat. xxi. a and mar. xii. a and Luke. xx.c
The stone which the builders refused and cast aside, the same is made to be
the head stone of the corner.

And ye have heard Christ himself obiecting the testimony of this scripture
unto the Phariseis, who attempted and did the best they could to cast aside the
stone which God had chose^. Yea and of thissame stone an other Prophet also
makes mention: Esai. xxviii d. and i. Petr. ii. b
I shall lay in the foundation of Sion a stone, approved and tried, a corner
stone, a stone of price founded in the foundation. And did not the tune of
Christ's words when he lived, agree with the words of this prophecy, at what
time he propouned a parable of an house builded upon a sound rock of stone,
which house no violent blaste or rage of wyndes or waters could be hable to
pluck out of his place? Math. vii. d. and Luke. vi g and Math. xvi.
wherein veraily he signified himself to be the fou^dacion of the church,
against whom no not y^ gates of hell are hable to preuaill, as he did one day
freely promise unto his disciple Peter. Salomo^ builded a temple at Jerusalem,
according to the appoyntement and ordeinaunce of Moses. But like as he being a
peaceful king did bear the image and figure of Messiah, who restored a
perpetual peace and atonemente for ever between God and man: so the said
Temple being built up with man's labor, contained the figure of the Temple,
whereof Christ himself was the builder, a chief workman, as the Lord many
years agon spoke by his Prophet Nathan unto David, ii. kings. vii. b.
as ye read in the secound book of the kings: Thou shall not be he, that
shall build me an house to dwell in, but I shall reise thy sede after the,
which shall come forth of thy womb, he shall build up an house to my name,
and I shall establish his throne even for ever and ever. And verayly that the
words which spoken by the said Prophet, do not agree to be spoken of
Solomon: even this point (though there were nothing else) does plainly prove
and convince, because in Salomons throne even now at this present day there
sit strange borne aliens, and all the whole people of the Jews shall shortly
be dispersed and scattred abroad into all nations of the world.

The said house which Solomon built in Jerusalem, was a buisie thing, with
slaughter of beasts, with fumigacions, with washynges, and very troubleous
with perfumes. But this house which Christ has builded, is made acceptable
through faith invisible, and this house knows no end. For the Prophet in
the same place before alleged speaks in this manner: And faithful shall thy
house be, and thy kingdom even for ever, before my face, and thy throne or
seat shall be firmly established for ever.

These promises are the vainest of the world, and the most full of lies, ii.
king. vii.c.
if they be taken (according as the lettre renneth) to concern Solomon, or
David either. For David, he deadly foiled his kingdom with aduoutrie coupled
with murdre: and Solomon was through the carnal love of weomen plucked away
from God, and drawn even unto idolatry.

Consider ye now, in what sort the words of Nathan do agree with the
words of Esai: Thou shall (says Esai) be called ye city of the ryghteous
man, Esai. i. g
and the faithful city. And of all me^ that ever were, there has been none
besides only Christ alone, who might be called purely righteous, not only free
from all corrupcion or infeccion of sin, but also such an one, that by and
through him, all men are justified and made righteous. And what does Christ
require of his servants, but faith?

And for the same consideracion did he call his church, which cannot skill of
the works of the law, the faithful city, wholly altogether staighyng and
trusting on him alone. When ye hear that this city shall be redeemed in
judgment, ye see the confidence and trusting on the ceremonies of the law to
be taken away. For God judges not man of his works, but of his faith, not
of meat or drink, not of the garment, or of solitary quiet living, but of
the godliness of mind. And the judgment is this: that such persons as shall
believe in Christ, shall through the death the same Christ, who suffered peines
and torments for all creatures, be redeemed from their sins, and shall be
justified through his righteousness, if they follow and go the steps of
their head and captain. Ye hear now and know the spiritual city and
temple, which cannot be showed ne pointed unto with men's fyngers, as neither
the king and workemanselfe can be poynted unto, according to the lesson here
following which himself taught, wha^ he was hear living: when they shall say:
mat. xxiiii b
Behold here is Christ, behold yonder he is: believe ye them not. The Jews
glory in the mount of Sion, which bears the temple: But after this there
shall be a ghostly Sion bearing up the minds and souls of them that believe,
Mar. xiii. b Luke. xvii c
from the covetous desire of things earthly, to ye study of things
celestial, of which the Prophet Esai prophesied unto you, saying: And there
shall be in the last days an hill prepared, Esai. ii. a
the house of the lord, in ye top of mountains, and it shall be lifted up
above all hills. And all nations shall flow unto him, there shall many
peoples go, and shall say: Come ye, let us clyme up to the mountain of the
lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he shall teach us his ways,
and we shall walk in his paths: for forth of Sion shall the law come, and
the word of the lord forth of Jerusalem. David also does ofttymes make
mention of this spiritual mount: psalm. cxxiiii.
They that trust in the Lord as the mount of Sion, shall not be moved for
ever, which dwells in Jerusalem. And of this material temple, of which
the Jews are now proud, how it shall shortly be cast down, even Christ
also prophesied. Your house (says he) shall be leaft deserte and waste unto
you. And that the selfsame thing should even so come to pass, Luke. xix. and
xxi.
God had before that time threatened unto Solomon, as ye read in the third
book of the kings. iii. king. ix b.
And the temple which I have poynted and marked out to my name, I shall cast
out from my sight, and Israel shall be into a proverb and into a common talkyng
stock to all peoples, and this house shall be into an exaumple. Every body
that passes by it shall be astouned for woondres, and shall hiss at it, and
shall say: wherefore has the Lord thus done to thissame land and to thissame
house? And they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the Lord their God.
For this is thatsame house, the prouoker, with whom God does by his Prophets
so often times chyde and bralle, and which so far forth fell from their God,
that his only son they hoighced up and nailed on the cross. Yea and moreover
instead of a people carnal and stifnecked, the Prophet does promise a
people peaceable, and obedient even unto death. For in manner following does
Esai speak: and they shall forge their swords into plugh shares, and their
spears into sithes and sicles. One nation shall not lift up the sword against
an other nation, Esai. ii. a
neither shall they any ferther forth be exercised to fightyng in battle. Ye
house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of our God. Are not
these words consonaunt and agreeable to the words of Christ in which he
promised, that he would of the very stones rei^e up children unto Abraham? and
when he called himself the light of the world, whom whosoever followed should not
walk in derknesse? when he cast at them this saying of the Prophet Esai?
Ihon. viii d


This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
Esai. xxix. a
And as for a new people he promises unto himself by the Prophet Oseas, a
people not making vauntes and braggues of their works, but acknowlageyng the
mercy of God. And it shall be in a place, where it shall be said unto the^: Ye
are none of my people: it shall be said unto the^, the children of the living
God: And again: And I shall have mercy on ye same people, which was destitute
of mercy: signifying the people of the Gentiles, who whereas it has hitherto
served idolles shall shortly receive the doctrine of ye gospel, which the
Jews has refused and forsaken, of whom the Psalmiste David also has
prophesied tofore: Psalm. xvii
A people, whom I knew not, has served me, in hearing of ye ear has it
obeyed me. Did not ye words of Christ agree with this prophecy, John. x.c.
wha^ he said? I have other sheep too, which are not of this fold, even them
also must I needs bring home. Forsouth the priesthood and the kingdom restored
and made new again, does make all things new. And as for a new priest the
holy writ of the Prophets had promised aforehande. For the mystical psalm
renneth in manier and form following: The Lord has sworn and it shall not
forthynke him: thou art a priest for evermore after the order of Melchisedec.
Melchisedec being both a priest and a king, Psalm. cix. a
the priest of the highest god (for he was not instituted by the law,) and the
king of Salem, (that is to say, the king of peace) signified Christ, who
neither has had beginning, ne never shall have endyng. Thissame Christ, not
through the blood of calfes or of goats, but through his own blood enters
into the high holy place, to make intercession for the sins of all the whole
world. And this sacrifice he executed in the altar of the cross offreyng
himself a most pure sacrifice unto God the father. Such a priest certes had
god long agon promised unto Helias when he was ready to dye: i. king. ii. g
I shall (says he) reise up unto my self a feithfull priest, who shall do
after mine own heart, and after mine own mind, and I shall build up unto
him, a feithfull house, and he shall walk before mine enoynted people al days
for ever. And veraily this is even the verai same thing which Christ himself
has promised unto you: mat. xxvii. a John. xxiiii d.
I am with you even until the consummacion of the world. Now instead of the
bloody slaughter of beasts which the priests of Moses law did use, Psalm.
xlix. 6
what kind of sacrifice shall succeed, the prophet has not leaft unspoken.
For the psalmiste by inspiracion says thus: Sacrifice thou unto God, the
sacrifice of laud, and pay thy vows unto the highest: call on me in the day
of tribulacion, and I will deliver thee, and thou shall glorify me. And again
in the same place. Psalm. xlix.
Whosoever offreeth me thanks and praise, honors me, and to him that ordreeth
his conversation right, will I show the salvation of God. And in another
place: Psalm. iii. a
Sacrifice ye the sacrifice of righteousness, and trust ye in the Lord. Ye
have here now heard a threfold manier of sacrifice, that is to wete, the
sacrifice of prayers or vows, (whereof Christ has thus taught you:
Whatsoever ye shall ask my father in my name, he will give it unto you: John.
xiiii. b.
) the sacrifice of laud and praise, (which it is euidente enoughe that he
solemnly executed and accomplished, many times rendering thanks unto his
father:) and the sacrifice of righteousness, which gives and perfourmeth the
strength and power of life to the innocente, and the serviceable attendaunce of
charity toward the nedie. And of this righteousness did he in propre
person show unto you a perfect exaumple, spendyng his own soul and life for
his sheep, being found only and alone among men, in whom no fraud ne guyle
was. He taught this thing also out of ye prophets words, saying thus: Go ye,
and learn what these words of the Prophet do mean. Mercy will I have,
Osee. vi.^
and not sacrifice: In the spiritual temple than, under the most highest
priest Christ, there shall not now be given distribucion of raw meat out
of the fleashe of calfes, of goats, or of sheep: but of the precious body and
blood of Jesus Christ, which he has once for all offered, to the end that it
may al times, be spirituallye taken of his enoynted, renewyng unto themselves
after a certain manier, the death of their head and king by that thankful
commemoracion. Forsouth this is the host, which shall shortly be offered all
the world over by the priests, whom God has enoynted: of which sacrifice
Malachias spoke before in the spirit of Prophecy: Malach. i. c
I have no will in you (says the Lord of hos^es,) and gift will I none take
of your hand. For from the arisyng of the sun, unto the going down, my name
is great in all nations, and in every place there is sacrificed and offreed
unto me a clean oblacion. And this was it, which was foretold to Hely the
priest also, that it should come to pass, that whosoever should come into the
new temple, should say: Leat me go, I beseech thee, to one side of the
priesthode, that I may eat a morsel. This is the same sacrifice which
Christ in Estur supper gave unto his disciples, mat, xxvi, c and mark xiiii*
c, and Luke, xxii. b, and i, Corinth, xi, c,
puttyng forth bread unto them, which he said to be his body, and geuyng
them the cup, which he said to be the cup of his blood, by which his
blood he consecrated unto them a new testamente, that is to say, a band and
league of frendeshyp never to dye ne decay. All these things if ye two have
not seen on your own parties, yet at leastewyse ye might have heard it of
his twelve special Apostles, by mean of whom he has wylled all that has
been wrought and dooen, to come to the knowlage of all creatures. Like as
Christ cummyng from heaven, has turned all carnal things into ghostly, the
city, the temple, the priesthode, the sacrifices: so would he also his
kingdom to be new. And for the same cause did he much use to call it the
kingdom of heaven, because ye should not look for any such manier thing as
ye see many in the kingdom of the world. For although he were the Lord of
all, yea even before he came down into the earth: yet was there a ghostlye
kingdom, which because he would recover unto his father, he became obedient
to the same, unto the death of the cross. For by that means has he ouercomed
and vanquished his adversary: that way has he delivered his people and made
them free: by that means has he recovered, enlarged, and establisshed his
kingdom unto his father. And in deed the Prophet promised Messiah by the
title of a king and a captain: but he assigns a double cummyng of him: the
former (which your selves have seen) humble and peaceable. For he came to
heal, and not to strieke in the way of vengeance. But he shall come in the
end of the world with majesty, guarded and encoumpaced round about with many
thousands of Angels to judge the quick and dead.

And now in this time, because he has come low and mylde, many have taken
slaundre of conscience, insomuche that even those same twelve also, (whom he
had out of all the coumpanie specially chosen out as most feithfull and
trusty unto him,) being strieken in a dread, have fled every man his way
for fear, yea and one has reneagued him too, saying that he never knew him.
But if ye would diligently compare the writing of the Prophets with the
things which ye have seen wrought and done, there should be no cause why ye
should be offended or slaundred: zacha, ix, b,
but there is cause why ye should acknowlage him, who came such an one as he
was promised to come. Consider ye what Zachary says: Behold, thy king shall
come unto the righteous, and a salueour, being himself in form of a poor
man, mountyng upon an ass, and upon a colte the foale of a she ass. He that
so came, came not to make battle, but to destruie the battayles of the world
which are made and kept under Satan's banners. For the Prophet brings in
byanby after: And I shall scattre soondrie ways abroad, the carte from
Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the bow of battle shall be
destruied, and he shall speak peace to the nations and his power shall be
from sea to sea.

Ye saw him enter the city of Jerusalem with this pomp, partly to mock the
kingdoms of this world, and partly because he would put you in good
remembrance of the prophecy: Esai. ix: b
And now mark ye well this point, whether Esai did promise him of any other
sort. For every violent taking of booties and forceable ruffleyng, and garment
embrewed with blood, shall be for burning, and the meat of fire. For a little
one is borne to us, and a son is given to us, and princely power is set upon
his shoulder, and his name shall be called the meruaylous, a Counsaillour, the
God of strength, the father of the world to come, the Prince of peace: his
empier shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: He shall sit
upon the seat of David, and upon his kingdom that he may conserve the same,
and make it strong in judgment and righteousness. When ye hear a kingdom
and princely power set upon his shoulder: do ye not manifestly hear the
kingdom of the cross, which cross Christ did bear to vanquishe the powers of
the aier? when ye hear, ye prince of peace, forsooth, ye understand a king
alluryng with benefits and not co^pelling with violence ne with fear: when ye
hear ye father of the world to come, ye see one much unlike to the princes of
this world. Neither does he describe him a man of any other sort, where he
speaks of him in a certain other place. Esai. xi. ^
And he shall strike with the rod of his mouth, and with the spirit of his
lips shall he sleagh the wicked: and righteousness, shall be ye girdle of his
loignes, and feith the belt of his reins. The woulfe shall dwell with the
lamb, the leoparde shall lie down hard by with the goat, and all the rest
that follows much dessonaunt and contrarious from the armor and battayles of
worldely princes. Psaml. ii. a
Now harken ye, what himself says of himself in the mystical psalm of
David. As for I, am constituted of him a king upon Sion his holy hill,
preaching the precepte of him: did he not in these words manifestely express
the kingdom of the word evangelical? Certes this is ye sweorde, whereof an
other psalm makes mention. Be thou girt with thy sweorde upon thy thigh,
psalm. xliiii. a
o thou most mightiest: with thy beatutie and fairness ente^de thou,
prosperously proceed and reign thou, for thy verity, and meekness, and
righteousness. And who has heard that a king has in the beauty of his body
prosperously gone foreward, or else to have gotten himself a kingdom with
meekness? But this was the grace of the word of God, by which ye have seen
Jesus allure and draw unto him great multitudes of people: this was the truth
against which ye Phariseis did so many times in vain attempt to wrestle and
strive. This manner a sweorde it was, which he at the time when he should die,
advertised his Apostles to get them, of which he had before also spoken,
allegeing that he was not come into ye earth to send peace, but the sweorde.
Such like ones also are the arrows of the mighty being sharp, Math. x. a
with which he goreth the inordinate lusts and desires of men, with the which
he kills the covetous man, and reiseth the beneficial bounteous man, with
the which he sleagheth the idolatre, and reiseth up the professor of
eua^gelicall godliness, with which he kills the fierce man, and the man of
vengeance, and reiseth up the meke and the merciful, with which he
overthrows the proud man, and sets up the humble. Will ye understand the
kingdom, what sort and nature it is of? See ye what manner ministers and
enlargers of his dominion and iurisdiccio^ he chose out for the nons: Poor
fellows, me^ of low degree, me^ of no learning ne knowlage, but even of the
bare mother wit, and toungue, ne with any treasour, ne weapon, nor victayles,
ne with any strength or maintenance of this world, furnished or armed against
the capcious malice of the Phariseis, against the power of princes, against the
pride of the Philosophiers, that is to say, of ye great schole me^. And by
these captains shall he outwarre and subdue all the universal kingdoms of
the world, with none other co^plete harness, then with the helmes of
salvation, which is the right understanding of holy scripture: with the buckler
of feith, by virtue whereof (God being their protector) they shall be in perfeite
safeguard against al assaults of the wicked people: with the Jack or haberion
made of the righteousness of all the virtues eua^gelicall: with the belt of
chastity, and with shoes of the ghospels making, which is an heart pure from
all yearthly affeccions: but most specially above al things, with the sweorde
of the spirit, which is the word of God. So was it thought good unto God,
that by mean of his sons weakness he would show his power: by preaching
which should be accou^pted worldly folishenes, he would declare his wisdom:
and through the worldly shame of the cross, he would renoume his glory. In
these things consists the kingdom eua^gelicall, in the mean while until
the majesty of Christ shall in the end of the world show forth it self, his
low degree laid away: and the blissful state of the godly sort shall also
show it self not stained or defoiled with any affliccions. And yet this
outward bassenesse contains a ghostly strength of the spirit both effectual
and apt to cast down al buildinges, that lift up themselfes to stand against
the glory of God. Have ye ever seen any thing more ientill or pacient then
Christ was? have ye seen any thing more low or basse in worldly acceptacion,
any thing more poorer, more meke, more felowlike with the people, and more
ferther removed from all likeness of a kingdom? And yet what thing could
there be more regal or kinglike, then with a word to cast out wicked
spirits, with a word speaking to caulme the wyndes and the sourges of ye
seas, with touching to heal folks that were infecte with lepry, and with mere
bidding to put away al kinds of diseases? How many times escaped he harmless
through the thickest of the Jews working death unto him? He suffered himself
to be taken: but at the voice of him the armed soldiers fell down flat on the
ground. He dyed on the cross, but what thing could be of more power then this
death, which made all the elements of the world to shake, which caused the
sun to lose his light, and to be full of derkenesse, which cut stones in
soondre, which opened graves, which raised the dead bodies out of the same?
There could be nothing more low or basse to the worldeward the^ was his
nativity: but yet even in his nativity also there did straight way at the
first hour appear tokens more the^ one of his high majesty, which he than did
and would not be acknowe^ of. He is borne of a tender young virgin, but it is
by the operacio^ of Gods holy spirit. He was laid down in an ox mau^ger:
but the Angels sing glory to God in the highest. He lies crying being an
infaunte in the cradle place, but Herod being a king trembles for fear, and
the Magians wurship him on their knees. These things being as yet known not
to very many, shall in time to come be preached throughout all the universal
world. And with such like sure fenses shall he appoynte and furnishe his
Apostles also. That if ye shall here after read the scriptures and mark them
well, and shall confer them with the things which ye have seen and heard: ye
cannot doubt but that he is the same Christ, which was promised, the priest, the
king, and the salueour of all the world, after whom there is none other to be
looked for. Rekon, I pray you, and consider in your minds all his whole age,
which ye have partly with your own iyes seen, and partly ye might have
known of his kynsfolkes and familiars: and ye shall not find any one point,
that has not been both signified and marked out by figures, and also
foretold by the Prophets. He was promised out of the stock of David, and out
of the tribe of Judah, and out of the town of Bethlee^. As touching the place
where he should be borne, se ye whether Micheas did derkely prophecy, michea.
v. a
or else plainly. And thou Bethleem Effrata, a little one thou art in the
thousands of Judah. Out of the shall one come for the which shall be unto me a
rewler in Israel: and his cummyng forth is without beginning from the days of
eternity. And that this should so come to pass, the Scribes and the Phariseis
understood before they were done, Math. ii. a
who when Herod demanded the question of them, made answer at once, that
Messiah should be borne in the city of Bethleem. And euidente it is, that
Jesus was borne in this city through the occasion of the surueigh and tax
which Caesar caused to be made. Luke. ii. a
The cause and matter self was through Herodes cruelty made known to the
world. And once ye know, that he was commonly reputed not for a Bethleemite,
but for a Nazarea^ and a man of Galile, because he was brought up in Nazareth
until the time of full man's state, and lived there a good noumbre of years
with his fosterfather Joseph, mat. xxvii. d. Luke. xxiii d. Ihou. xix. d
and his mother Mary: in so much that the poisee of his cross had the
intitulacion of Jesus the Nazarean. Neither was this point unspoken of by the
Prophets neither, who now and than note him and call him by the name of holy,
and of the holy of holyes, because he was singularly consecrated to the Lord,
not only after the law, which indifferently apperteined to the first borne of
man sex (according whereunto Jesus also was brought by his pare^tes unto the
temple, and there consecrated unto the Lord:) but also above all mortal
creatures by a certain special prerogative, which no man had but he. This
Nazarean did Jacob see, being a man in manner altogether blind in the iyes of
the body, but very sharp and quick of sight in the iyes of his feith, at what
time he blissed Joseph, who bare the figure of Christ.

And they shall be (says he) in the head of Joseph, Ge. xlix. d
and in the top of the croune of the Nazarean that was separate from his
brethren. For whatsoever thing the law of Moses does after the flesh
appoynte or enjoin for consecratyng of the Nazareans, the same is after a
spiritual understanding fulfilled in Christ. And God to David thus speaks
in the psalms:

Of the fruit of thy womb will I set upon thy seat. Psalm. cxxxi b. Esai. xi.
^
And again elsewhere the prophet Esai before David's time. There shall a rod
issue forth of the root of Iesse, and a flower shall asce^de out of his root,
and the lords spirit shall rest upon him. And well known it is ye Mary was
of the tribe of Judah, and of the house of David, neither was that thing hidden
or unknown to the Phariseis, who, wha^ Jesus himself before he suffered death
asked of the^, whose son Messiah should be, mat. xxii. d mat. xii. d Luke.
xx. g Esai. vii
made answer without any study or tarying: the son of David. The Prophet
had foresayed that he should be borne of a virgin. For thus did Esai prophecy.
For this cause shall the Lord himself give unto you a sign. Behold a virgin
shall conceive and shall bring forth a son: and his name shall be called
Emanuell. Daniel foretold the selfsame thing more couertely, Daniel. ii. a
when he expouned what was mente by the stone that was cut of from the hill
without hands, which brake al to pieces and into powdre, thatsame prodigious
image made of gold, silver, brass, iron, and clay: and within a short while
it grew into a great mountain, which with his largeness filled and possessed
all the kingdoms of the world. For Christ being without man's help borne of
the virgin Mary, shall grynde, and crushe to powdre all the kingdoms of the
world, and shall with his doctrine possess all the world. Uerayly Ezechiell
being enspired did perceive the same to fore, at what time he described the Este
gate of the temple, through which ye Majesty of the Lord entered in. Of which
gate he speaks in this manner: This gate shall be still shut, and shall not
be opened, and there shall not a man pass through it: because the Lord God of
Israel has come in thereat, else shall it be shut still. The prince himself
shall come through it, etc. When ye hear the Temple of the Lord, ye know well
enough to be me^t thereby the womb of Mary consecrated by the holy ghost. When
ye hear the Este gate, do ye not know the menyng of it to be the enclosure
and tabernacle of the virginly chastity, which neither any mortal man
entreing unto it, ne the son of God either entreyng in, or cummyng forth of
it has violated or defoiled? Certes thissame is the Este gate, out of which
proceeded and issued the light that should lighten all the world universal.
And this mystery although it be not yet published abroad among the Jews, yet
is it not unknown unto those, that have had familiar conversation of living
with Mary the mother of Jesus, and with Joseph her spouse. For the said Joseph
was taken and used as a most true and undoubted witness of this privy
mystery, which at his due time shall be famously spread and spoken of
throughout the world universal: how that a virgin without any like exaumple
before going sense the world first begone, by the breathing of the holy ghost
upon her, brought forth a babe, which was partaker of the divine nature of the
godhead, and of the humain nature of man both at once. That if it appear to you
or seem a thing incredible that God should be borne of a creature mortal:
considre ye what the Prophet Baruch did prophecy of the son, whom God,
taking piety and compassion on mankind, did even for the very purpose send
into the earth, that unto the straighing wandreers and to the blinded he
should show the way of health and salvation.

Batuch. iii
Thissame is our God (says he) and there shall be none other esteemed besides
him. This is he that has found all the way of discipline, and has ^aught it
unto Jacob his babe, and to Israel his beloved. After this, he has been seen in
earth, and has lived among men. And as for Daniel does also show the time
of his birth, Dani. ix.
accoumptyng it by seuens or seuenfoldes of wekes and years, if a man will any
thing curiously search and try it out. But long and many a day before him,
the patriarch Jacob, being nowe^ ere the time of his departing out of this
world, and endewed with the spirit of prophecy to show things to come,
prophesied in this manier:

Gene. xlix.
The scepter shall not be taken away from Judah, and a guide from the thighe of
him, until he come which must be sent, and he shall be the expectacion of the
heathen. Now all the regio^ of the Jews, were in subieccio^ to the Emperors of
Rome. Iewrye had Herod to their king being an aliene, or outlandishe man
borne. That thing did evidently convince and prove that Messiah should now
come, if a body had serched the prophecies. And where he added: Math. ii. a
And he shall be the expectacion of the heathen: albeit this poynet shall in
time to come be more clear and manifest, yet did even than at the veraye time
of his nativity appear. For immediately upon the deliverance of the virgin,
there come renning thither by the guiding and leding of a sterre, three Magians,
or sage philosophiers with presents to wurshyp the new king, and to do
homage unto him. And even thissame veraye point, that it should so be, had not
the voice of the prophets leafte unspoken neither. For thus says Esai: Esai.
xii.
Before he have the knowelage to refuse that is eiuill, and to choose that is
good, he shall take the spoils of Samaria and Damascus against the king of the
Assyrians. For while he being yet a young babe and an infaunte draws three
Magians unto him by the ledyng and guidyng of a sterre, and of idolaters makes
them wurshippers of the king of kings: did he not take the spoils of Samaria,
which country had an eiuill name for worshippyng and serving of idolles?

For Damascus was in old time reputed for a part of Arabia before that by the
diuidyng and particion of the countries of Syria, it was assigned to be a
part of Syrophenicia. And in deed the East parties have much abundance of
sweet odouriferous savors and spieces: whereof the Magians of their richesse
brought forth frankincense, and myrthe, and gold: whereof the prophecy failed
not to make mention neither. For thus speaks Esai. Esai. lx.
Al they of Saba shall come bringyng gold and frankynsence, and showing forth
laud unto the Lord. The prophecy also of the Psalm makes mention of
the same where it says: Psa. lxxi. a Math. ii. c
There shall be given unto him of the gold of Arabie. And again in another
place: The kings of the Arabians and of Saba shall bring presents. For in
those regions and parties, the chief rewle and governance is commonly in the
hands of the Magians, that is to say, the saiges, or the wise me^ of
knowlage. And forsooth by the name of the king of the Assyrians, was signified
the wieked king Herod, who at the spryngyng up of Messiah, when it was told
him, was fore out of quiet in his mind and defeated of his purpose by the
Magians. Thereupon followed the murdreyng of the infauntes within all the limits
and bounds of Beethleem, which thing the prophecies did not leave unspoken
neither. For thus did Hieremie sing. The voice of heaviness, Hiere. xxxi.
weeping, and lamentacion was heard on high: even of Rachell mournyng for her
children, and she would not be comforted* because they were away. For so did he
express the lamentyng of the mothers bewailing the boucherly murdrement of
their young suckyng babes. And the place he did half derkely and mistically
express by the name of Rachel, whose sepulcher is not far of from Bethleem.
Than was he secretly conveyed into Egipte by the warnyng of an Angel: and was
brought home again from thence by the warnyng of the same Aungel. And had not
the prophecy of Oseas showed that same before? Mat. ii. b Oiee. xi. a Mat. iii.
b Mark. i. b Luke. iii. d John. i. c
Out of Egipte have I called my son. Now before he begone to take in hand
the office of preaching appointed unto him by his father, did not his foregoer
John openly testify that he should come immediately furthwithal, and when he
came in deed, showed him to the people of the Jews with his finger? And had
not Esai clearly prophesied before that so it should be? Esai. xl. a
The voice of a crier in wilderness, prepaire ye the way of the Lord: make
ye the paths of our God straight in wilderness. I wysse ye saw John
preaching in wilderness, ye heard him acknowelaging this prophecy being
forespoken of himself. No nor the prophecy least not his baptism unspoken of
neither. Now where he begone his preaching not in Jerusalem, but in Galilee,
did not Esai prophecy clearly enough thereof before? saying: The land of Zabulon
and the land of Neptalim, Esai ix.
(where through the sea way goes over Iordane into the land of Galilee:) the
people which sat in derkenesse have seen a great light. And them that dwell in
the land of the shadow of death, upon the^ has the light shyned: and it is
well known that Capernaum, (where Jesus first dwelt when he entered the office
of preaching) stands in the marchesse of Zabulon and Neptalim, and that it is
a ^ttie sytuate on the shores side of the sea. Neither was there any
strangeness or clokyng made of the kind of doctrine, which he oftentimes
used among the people, Psalm. lxxvii a.
enwrappyng his mind and sentence in the mystical derkenesse of parables. For
thus renneth the discourse of the Psalm Azaph: In parables shall I open my
mouth, I shall speak proposicions from the beginning. And ferthermore that
people there should be which should cry out against his doctrine, and
withstand the same, as men sinistrely interpretyng and slaundreyng as well all
his sayings as dooinges, Esai. vi.
Esai prophesied saying: Ye shall hear in deed, but ye shall not understand,
ye shall plainly see, and not perceive. Harden thou the heart of this people,
stop their ears, and shut their iyes, that they see not with their iyes, hear
not with their ears, Esai. liii.
and understand not with their hertes, and convert and be healed. And such
people does he find fault withal in an other place also: Lord, who has
given credence unto the thing which we have heard? And ferthermore as
touching the miracles which ye have seen him showing, had not the holy
sayings of the Prophets plainly told thereof before? does not Esai thus
speak? Esai. liii.
He only has taken on him our infirmities, and has borne our peines. For what
kind of sore or evil has he not drieuen away from persons being in woeful
case and miserable? The Same Esai in an other place also speaks, yea, more
openly and plainly, of the self same thing in this manier.

Say unto them that are fearful: Be of good chere, and fear not. Behold*
your God comes to take vengeance, Esai. xxxv
and ye shall see the reward that God gives. God comes his own self, and
will deliver you. Than shall the iyes of the blind be lightened, and the ears
of the deaf be opened. Than shall the lame man leap as an heart, and the dumme
man's toungue shall give thanks. Have ye not with your own iyes seen Jesus
do all the premises, yea and greater things then those also? ye heard him
when he acknowelaged thissame prophecy as a thing written and spoken of
himself, at what time certain disciples of John being sent unto Jesus
demanded him, whether he were the Messiah that was looked for, or else it were
an other that was to be looked for, and he answered and said: Go your
ways, bear word again to John of the things which ye have heard and
seen. The blind see, the haulte go, Luke. vii, a
the lepres are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead arise again, and to the
poor is the glad tydinges preached. And that the chief rewlers of the
synagogue would be with these benefits yet still wurse and wurse incensed,
did not Esai after a goodly sort peinte out, under the parable of a vyneyarde,
which being with excedyng many points of diligente cure and good housebandyng
occasioned to bring forth good fruit, did not answer the expectacion of his
tiller?

Esai. v. b
I looked (says he) that it should have brought forth grapes: and it has
brought forth wild grapes: I looked that it should have done judgment, and
behold wickedness: and that it should have done righteousness, and behold
crying and misery. Mat. xxi. d Mar. xii. a Luke. xx. b
And does not the parable justly agree with the same sentence of prophecy,
which ye have heard of Jesus himself, concerning a vineyard enclosed and
fensed with a toure, and furnished with a wine press and a gutter, which
vineyard nevertheless through defaulte of the housebandmen yielded not condign
fruit to the Lord and owner? The Same thing also was noted by thatsame figtree,
which would not begin to be fruitful, Mat. xxi. b Luke. xiii. b
no not than neither, when much doungyng and cherishyng had been done to it.
Neither was there any thing else mente by the parable of the sede that was cast
upon ill ground. He found the same self fault else where also in the
Prophets: Mat. xiii. b Mar. iiii. a Luke. viii a Esai. lxv.
I have all the day long evermore holden out my hands to an unfaithful
people, that go not the rightway, but after their own imaginacions: to a
people that is ever defying me to my face. The men of power had envy at his
virtue, and slau^dreously surmuised those miracles to be wrought by the
supportacion of Beelzebub. Mat. xxvi. Mar. xiiii. Luke. xxii. John. xviii
zachar. ix
But the weakness of his body, the meannesse of his degree, and the
affliccions which he suffered, was a matter of offense and slaundre of
conscience to the weak, though they were no evil men. For when he was taken
of the Jews, even those same twelve specially chosen Apostles fled and ran
every man his way. See ye whether the Prophet Zachary leaft even this point
unspoken of too. psalm. lxxxvi*
I shall strieke the shepeheard (says he) and the sheep of ye flock shall be
scattred abroad. Whereunto accords the song of the eighty seventh psalm.
Mat. xxvi. Mar. xiiii c Luke. xxii. f Ioh. xviii. c
Thou have put away mine acquaintance far from me, and made me to be
abhorred of them. For did not Petur with a detestacion forswear his master,
and the other Apostles ready to do the same, if like peril had bloustreously
come upon them? And that this would so come to pass, Christ had foresaied to
Petur before it came to pass in deed. He was betrayed by Judas, who was one of
the noumbre of the twelve. Consider ye whether the prophetical psalm did not
foretell of ye also. Psalm. cxiiii
For if mine enemy (says he) had spoken ill of me, I would verayly have
patiently borne it, and if he that hated me, had spoken great things upon me,
I would peradventure have hidden my self from him. But thou a man of mine own
mind, my guide and my familiar. Now if ye have learned ye Christ, when Judas
coming of purpose to betray the lord unto the soldiers by mean of a
deceiptfull kiss, did thus speak unto him: Math. xxvi. Luke. xxii. e
Friend for what purpose art thou come? Betraiest thou the son of man with a
kiss? Did he not manifestly lay unto him in his very teeth ye saying of ye
prophet? he calls him a guide, because this Judas seemed in manner as one made
a rewler over the Apostles, because he had the charge of doing all affairs
abroad committed unto him. Again an other psalm speaks yet more clerly:
Psalm. xl. ^
For the man of my peace in who^ I have trusted, who eat my loanes has
magnified supplanting over me. And see I pray you, how the words of Christ
which he spoke to his disciples of the betraier at his last supper with them,
do justly agree with this prophecy: Psalm. xxxvii.
He that eats bread with me (says Christ) shall lift us his foot sole
against me. An other psalm again says: My friends and my next neighbors have
approached nere, and have stand against me. Psalm. liiii Psalm xxxvii
Yea and an other psalm yet again: his words are suppled above honey, and
they be very darts. And is it not a word softer the^ honey, to say haill
master being spoken with a kiss giving? And was it not a darte infected with
deadly poison, to say: Thatsame is he, hold ye him fast? Thus might ye have
heard of his Apostles, or in case ye have not yet heard it, ye may yet learn
it in time to come. Judas demanded of covenant of the bishops, and the chief
rewlers, the su^me of thirty pens or denaries of silver, with which deadly
su^me of money there was forthwithall a piece of ground bought for the burial
of poor folks. And both these points did the Prophet forespeake of in his
prophecy. As concerning the price that he was sold for, thus did one of ye
Prophets say: And they took thirty plates the price of him that was valued,
Zachar. xi
whom they bought of the children of Israel, and gave them for the potters
field. These things thus executed, Judas ouerlate repenting him of his fact,
honge himself, diminishing thereby the nou^bre of the twelve chosen, and making
a room for an other to be supplied into ye order of the Apostles. Psalm. cviii.
Neither was this vnspoke^ of by ye Prophets. For thus says ye process of
the mystical psame: Let their abiding be made to lie waste and let there not
be he that dwells in it, and his shepeherdship let an other body take. And as
for the deuilishe conuocacio^ for ye putting of Jesus to death, which was
solemnly kept in the house of Caiphas being the highest bishop, by the
Scribes, the Phariseis, the rewlers of the people, and the commons being sworn
to the same: mark ye whether the same point also has not been written and
declared by ye prophecy of the psalm, which says: Why do the heathen so
furiously rage together? Psalm. ii
and why do ye people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stand up,
and the rewlers take counsel together against the Lord, and against his
enoincted. Ye hear the namyng of the heathen, and ye know that Jesus was
crucified by Pilates servants of his crew: ye hear ye word, peoples, and
ye know that the multitude of all ^ortes of the Jews, cried, crucify him,
crucify him: ye hear the name of kings, and ye know ye Pilate was ye rewler
and governor of Iewry in Ceasars behalf, by whose sentence Jesus was
condemned: ye hear this word, ye rewlers of ye earth, and ye understand ye
headmen of the people of Iewry, who not understanding the law spiritual,
sought earthly things: and while they will in no wise be pulled from the same,
they put ye king of heaven to death. Yea and Esai also does fore threate^
the same. Woe unto ye souls of the^ (says he) for they have thought an
exceeding naughty thought against themselves, saying: let us tie up ye tighteous
man for he is not for our purpose. He was brought to judgment as a man accused
and to be arraigned. Esai. iiii. c
Yea and that thing also did Esai tell before. The Lord stands to be judged,
and he stands to judge the peoples: ye Lord shall come into judgment with the
elders of his people, and the rewlers of the same. Jesus was judged in the house
of Caiphas by the chief priests, Luke. xxii
Scribes, and Phariseis, and the chief rewlers of ye people. Eftsons condemned
he was by ye crying and clamor of ye people at ye benche of ye lieutenau^t,
wha^ they cried: Away with him, away with him: nail him on the cross. But
while the Lord is judged, they are judged themselfes, in ye their detestable
iniquity is by all manner ways and means bewraied. Pilate gave and pronounced
sentence of judgment against and upon them, when he said: I am free and
innocent from the blood of thissame righteous man, choose you. And themselves
gave sentence of judgment against themselves, when they cried. His blood be
upon us, Mat. xx^ii
and upon our children. Hieremie also much lame^teth their deiulishe weorkyng
against Christ. Lord (says he) thou have seen the iniquity of them against
me, ^re^. iii. f
judge thou my judgment. Thou have seen all their furious rageyng, all their
thoughts against me, thou haste heard all their reprochefulnesse O Lord, all
their thoughts against me, their lips arisyng against me, and studying
against me all the day, their sitting down, and their arisyng again have I
seen. Does he not in these words clearly (as it were in a plain picture) set
forth the priests and the head men of the people consultyng together how they
might put Jesus to death, huntyng for false testimonies whereby they might
oppress him being innocent laying blasphemy unto his charge, condemnyng him
by judgment before they had matier to him, sitting upon him as judges, arising
again when they had judged him, because they would accuse him before the
lieutenaunte? A mischievous sitting down, and a more mischievous arising up
again. And that not any kind of death at adventure might satisfy their
hatred, but there was specially chosen such a kind of death as was both
most shameful and also most hardest, Hieremie witnesses bearyng the person
of Christ. Hierem. xi.
This, o Lord, have I learned of thee, and I do understand it, for thou have
showed me their imaginacions. But I am as a meke lamb, that is carried away
to be slain, not knowing that they had devised such counsayles against me,
saying: we will destruie his meat with wood, and drieue him out of the land
of the living, that his name shall never more be thought upon. For the devise
and purpose of the Phariseis was this: that the name of Jesus after he were
accused, condemned, hanged between two notorious malefactors, should either
be vttrely for ever abolished, or else should be reputed among names execrable
and detestable. Now ferthe^ call ye unto your remembrance that Christ told
you all this matier before his death, how he should be betrayed and delivered
into the hands of the Gentiles, that he should be refused of men and cast
of, that he should be skorned, that he should be scourged, that he should be
crucified, all ye know by your own iye, that no point hereof was unadvisedly
done or by blind chaunse of casualtie. The Jews did before the presence of
Annas and Caiphas by mean of false witness, man xiiii. g mat xxvi. c. Luke
xxii. g
lay unto him the crime of blasphemy, then which there is none other crime
more heinous. And this matier was marked out and figured in Joseph, whom his
brethren conspiryng together through envy did accuse of a veraye naughty
crime. Before the judges Jesus answered either nothing at all, or else very
few words, wha^ there was no spark ne spotte of any crime in him, for he had
determined with himself to dye for the redemption of the world. Think ye
hardely that this was a thing dooen by blind chance, Genesis xxxvii
if Esai did not tell of it before. He was offered up because he would and he
opened not his mouth: as a sheep shall he be led to be put to death* and shall
keep silence as a lamb before one that shereth him, and he shall not open his
mouth. And see how justly the prophecy of the Psalm agrees with Esai. As
for me* I was like a deaf man, Psalm. lviii.
and heard not, and as one that is dumme, which does not open his mouth. I
became eue^ as a man that hears not, and in whose mouth are no reproufes. For
in thee, o Lord have I put my trust. For now was the full time come, that he
should willingly offer himself to all open shame of the world, as one that
should show unto his fellows a perfeicte exaumple of pacient suffreaunce:
bound he was, strieken and beaten he was, both with blows and buffettes,
scourged he was, and all to spetten in the face. He had a wede of purple done
on his back in the way of mockyng and skorning him, and crouned he was with a
croune of thorns, and being contemned of Herod, he was in the way of
puttyng him to worldly shame, sent back again to Pilate in a white vesture,
Luke. xxiii.
in a miserable likeness and pieteous to behold was he brought forth to the
people, and Barrabas was preferred before him to be pardoned and to escape.
Now forasmuch as he willyngly suffered all these things for the redemption of
the world, according to the foresayinges of the Prophets, it ought not to
have bred desperacion in you, but rather have given you the more hope. Does
not Hieremie lamente and bewail these things, where he says? The verai
breath of our mouth even the enoyncted Lord himself was taken in their net,
Tren. iiii.
of whom we say: under his shadow we shall be preserved among the heathen.
Hear ye again the same prophet lamentyng: He shall hold out his cheke
(says Hieremie) unto him that strieketh him: he shall be filled with words
of reuilying. In the assembly or conuocacion of the Jews, he was stricken with
a blow of the bishops servant. Of Pilates men he was stricken with blows and
buffettes and with a read: and yet made he no resistance. Now hear the
prophecy of the Psalm: Upon my back (says he) the sinners have ploughed,
Psalm cxxvii
they have made long furrows of their iniquity. And the song of holy Esaie is
much according to the same. The Lord god (says he) has opened my ear,
Esai. l.
therefore can I not say naie, nor withdraw my self: but I offer my back
unto the smyters, and my chekes to the nippers: I turn not my face from men
rebuking me and spetting upon me. Now when ye read the prophecy of the same
prophet in an other place, do ye not think your selves to see verai Christ
himself, scourged, spetted on, crouned with thorns, covered with a garmente,
and brought forth in presence to the people of the Jews in the way of
mockage and skorne? For he writes in manier following: He has neither beauty
ne favor, when we shall look upon him, there shall be no fairness: we shall
have no lust unto him. He is despised and abhorred of men, Esai. liii.
he is such a man as is full of sorrow, and as has good experience of
infirmities. We have rekoned him so vile, that we hyd our faces from him, yea
he was despised, and therefore we regarded him not. Howbeit he only has taken
on him our infirmity, and has borne our peynes, yet we did judge him, as
though he were plagued and cast down of god, and punished, whereas
notwithstanding he was wounded for our offenses, and smytten for our wickedness.
For the chastisement of our peace was laid upon him, and with his striepes are
we healed. Psalm. xxi.
Therefore thus speaks he of himself in the mystical psalm: As for me I am a
wourme, and not a man, the verai skorne of men, and the outcast of the people.
Neither has the mystical scriptures kept silence of his croune of thorn. For
unto the first man Adam it was said: Cursed is the earth in thy work. When
thou shall tille it, thorn and briers shall it cause to budde to thee. The Same
that the earth was to the former Ada^, Gene. iii.
the same thing was the Iewyshe people unto the second Adam. For thatsame earth
being so many sondrie ways tilled, provoked and occasioned with so many
benefits to bring forth good fruicte: it brought forth thorns unto their
tiller.

Now Christ was the spouse of the church or holy congregation, as ye heard
John also testify, and the son of the Synagogue, being a murdreer of her
own flesh and blood. Therefore in the mystical weddyng song the father
calls forth al me^ to this cruel sight of the spouse being crouned with
thorns. Balletes. ii
Go ye forth, O ye daughters of Sion, and behold king Solomon in the croune
wherewith his mother crouned him in the day of the gladness of his heart.
Forsooth thatsame was an earnest and effectual lover, which washed his spouse
in his own blood, and knitte her unto him with a band and knot impossible to
be undone. And this was thatsame day of espousall, which he had with so great
desire desired, so that to him being so earnestly in love, all delay and
tariaunce seemed long. When the lieutenaunte leaft nothing undone that he might
do to quitte Jesus, and to let him go, the chief men of the Jews together
with the people, cried with murdreyng and rageyng voices out aloude: Luke. xxii.
Away with him, away with him, crucify him, crucify him. Hierem. xii
And see how Hieremie leaft not that thing vnmencioned, speaking in the
person of Christ: I have forsaken mine own dwelling place, and have leaft
mine heritage. My life also that I love so well have I given into the hands of
mine enemies: Mine heritage is become to me, as a Lion in the wood: it cried
out upon me. But whatsoever thing was done unto him in the way of open shame,
Luke. xxii.
that shall he turn into his glory. Herod sent him back again to Pilate clad
in a vesture of white: and the people of the Gentiles shall in time cumming
embrace him for their priest. The crew of soldiers did upon his back a robe of
purple: they gave him moreover a read instead of a scepter: they set on his
head a croune made of thorns: Gods people shall acknowlage, and shall on their
knees wurshippe their king, even of such a facion ouercumming and trioumphing.
Herod and Pilate play and daly together, castyng Jesus as a boule or a balle
to and fro between them. But in the mean time they are made friends whereas
they were tofore at discord and variaunce by mutual hatered: and even in
their very so doing, did they no less then ratify Jesus to be a reconciler
and pacifier of all things which are in heaven, and which are in earth.
Whereof Job prophesied in this manner. The Lord reconcileth the hearts of the
princes of the earth. Now eftsons renew ye all thatsame sight unto your
selfs by castyng it in your mind, thatsame sight (I say) which now this
last day ye saw with your iyes, that is to wete, Jesus going out to the place
of execucion, and bearyng his cross upon his own shoulders. Had he not given
tokeninges yt it should so be, when he did many times say among his disciples
and the people?

Whosoever does not take up his cross and follow me, Math. x. d. Mar. viii d
is not worthy of me. Forsooth thissame was the scepter of the king of Jews,
that is to say, of all men confessyng the thing which Esai long and many a
day agonne, saw upon his shoulders, Esai. ix.v Genesis xxii.v
when he said: And his kingdom upon his shoulder. A figure thereof did Isaac
represente so many hundred years past, when he bore a faggot of wood upon his
shoulder for himself to be slain as a burnt sacrifice. But Isaac is safe unto
us, a ram only was slain, that is to say, the material body of Jesus,
which only could dye, but yet so dye, that it should within a very little time
arise to life again. Math. xx. d Mar. xii. a Luke. xx.v
And slain he was without the precinete of the city: and that the thing
should so be, Christ himself had signified tofore by the parable of the
housbandemen or fermers, which after they had cast the son out of the
vyneyarde, slew him. But long before did Moses signify the same thing, who as
ye read in the book that is entitled Leuiticus, commanded the calf that was
stain in sacrifice for ye sins of the people, to be carried forth without the
precinct of ye tents, Leuit. vii.
and there to be burnt. And taking it in an allegory, (that is to say by the
meaning, and not by the words,) was not Jesus burned up without the precinct
of Jerusalem, in that he being enkiendled with the inestimable fire of
charity and love toward mankind, Nume. xxi.
offreed himself up altogether? Wha^ ye saw Jesus hanging of a great height
upon the tree of the cross, did not thatsame mystical serpente come to your
mind, whom Moses did in old time hang upon a stake, which should be a
safegarde unto all that were stoungen with serpents, if they did earnestly and
steadily cast their iyes upon the same? The iye of a man is feith. And whosoever
shall earnestely cast this iye upon Jesus crucified, shall immediately be safe:
Yea and this very thing also did Moses foreshewe that it should be, that the
Jews beholding Christ ha^ging on the cross, who by his death gave life unto
all creatures, yet nevertheless would not believe in him. Deuteronomy xxviii
For in this manner speaks he in the Deuteronomie. And thy life shall hang
before thine iyes, and thou shall fear both day and night, and shall have no
trust in thy life. Ye saw him hangyng between twoe thieves, and do ye not
acknowlage the prophecy, Esai. liii.v Math. xx.v Luke. xxii d Amos. viii.
that said? And with the wicked was he reputed. Ye saw the derkenesse of
night suddenly ouercast in the mids of ye day time from the sixth hour until
the nynth: Christ himself said and affirmed himself to be the light of the
world, and gave knowlage yt the night drew nere at what time he should be
done to death out of this world. And did not Amos clearly prophecy this
matter? And it shall be in that day (says the Lord) the sun shall go down
in the noontide, and I will make the earth to be all ouercast with derkenesse
in the day of light. Neither did Zachary hold his peace concerning this
matter, when he said: And it shall be in that day, there shall be no light, but
cold and froste, and it shall be one day which is known to the Lord. Not
day nor night in their due time, in the euentyde shall the light be. It was a
day known to the Lord which day the Jews knew not by the marks thereof.
Zach xiiii.v
Day was it not, because that about the hour of noontyde arose derkenesse:
night was it not, because that after the nynth hour light came again. Than
cold and froste there was in the hertes of the disciples when they fled every
manne his way, and despaired, in the noumbre of whom was Petur: who
ferthermore abiured the Lord (that is to say, swore that he knew him not, nor
had naught to do with him, nor naught would he meddle with him,) while being
thoroughly taken with cold he takes warmth and heat by the coals of wicked
Jews. Co^ferre ye now the things that were done while Christ was hangyng on
the cross. When he thirsted, there was raught up unto him wine mixed with
myrrh, and vyneagre withal: even like as when he should be hoighced upon the
cross, they offered him wine mixed with myrrh. And did not the prophecy of
the Psalm tell plainly hereof before, Psalm. lxviii
where it says? They gave me gaul for my meat, and in my thirst they gave
me drink of vineagre. Ye heard the Phariseis and the rewlers like conquerours
speaking proudely against him as he hanged on the cross, Luke. xxiii.
and among other reuiling words laying this also against him. He said he was
the son of God, he puts his wholle trust and confidence in the Lord, let
him now deliver him if he will have him. See ye now how lustely the prophecy
of the Psalm did not only foreshewe the very thing: but also did speak even
the verai words of those wicked persons, Psalm. xxii.
where it says: But as for me, I am a wourme and no man: a very skorne of
men and the outcast of the people. All they that see me, laugh me to skorne*
they shoot out their lips, and shake their head, saying: he trusted in God
that he would deliver him: leat him deliver him if he will have him. Ye saw the
lamb, Luke. xxiii.
of which Esai prophesied, not once openyng his lips, but holdyng his peace
at al opprobrious words, yea and moreover praying hertely for the causers and
workers of his death, when he cried. Father forgive them, for they know not
what they do. Now look ye whether the psalm did not fore tell this thing
too? Psalm. cviii.
They spoke against me with guilefull roungues, they coumpaced me round about
with words of hatred, and assailed me without cause. Instead of that they
should have loved me, they railled against me, and as for me I did pray. Ye
saw him fastened to the cross with nailles, and hang naked, his body
stretched every way to the vttermoste. Hear ye now a clear and plain
prophecy of the same. They perced my hands and my feet, and they told all my
bones. Psalm. xxi.
Ye saw the soldiers partyng emongst them the garments of Jesus when he was
crucified. And this poyncte also follows the prophecy of the same Psalm in
this manier. They parted my garments among them, and cast lottes upon my
vesture: his other garments they parted emongst them: for his coat that was a
whole piece in it self, because it had no seames that it might be vnriept,
they drew lottes. When he was even at the point to yield up the ghost, ye
heard him say with a strong voice: Father I commend my spirit into thy
hands, Psalm, xxx.v
declaryng the prophecy of the psalm to had spoken before of his death. Ye
saw the two thieves legs broken in sodre: and that Jesus legs were not
broken, because he would by this sign also declare himself to be the true
Paschall Lamb, whose blood has made free and has delivered from everlasting
death al persons that believe in him, of whom there was a commandment
given in the book entitled Exodus: Ye shall not break any bone of him.

Ye might also have marked this point that he overcame the strength of the
world and Satan with the contrary: with simplicitee he maistered craftiness,
with meekness he overcame fierceness, with humilitee he had the ouerhande
of pomp and glory, with courteous behaueour he subdued pride, and in like
manier with the weakness of body he conquered the power of Satan. For what
thing is more weak or feeble then a man dying, and yet what great strength this
weakness had, ye saw. Ye beheld and saw the sun ouercaste with derkenesse
the earth to be cast in a quakyng, stones to brast one piece from another,
Psalm. cv.
graves to open, the vail of the temple to be cut in soondre. These things
veraily declared that his special great strength, wherewith he thoroughly subdued
the deiuill, and the world, was preastly and readily showed forth at the hour
of his death.

And this thing also had the mystical Psalm foreshewed, Abacuc. iii
where it said: Tell ye in the nations, God has reigned from the tree. And
this thing did not the Prophet Abacuc leave unspoken: His brightness (says
he) shall be as ye light: horns in his hands: there is his strength hidden:
death shall go before his face: and the deiuill shall go out before his feet.
Ye hear the horns or peakes of the cross, the feblenesse whereof beguyled the
prince of this world. For the lord Jesus had there privily hidden his heavenly
virtue and strength, to the end that he might oppress the deiuill: he led death
in a triumph, he made Satan to be openly known what he was, and made him an
open show: and his verai self before he should dye, John. vii. c
foretold that this thing should so be, in that he said: When I shall be exalted
up from the earth, I will draw all things unto my self. Deu. xxxiii.
And the selfsame thing did Moses signify being nere the time of his death,
although by derker words of a mystical sense. For when he blissed the tribes
every one by it self, and it was come to Joseph (who bare the figure of
Christ) he said: As of a first borne ox is the beauty of him, and his
horns as the horns of the beast Rhinoceros, with them shall he fan the
nations even unto the ends of the earth. So has it ben thought good to the
wisdom of God: that Christ should subdue the universal world through the horns
or angles of the cross. Neither did the Prophets leave his buiriall unspoken
of neither. For Hieremie representyng the person of Christ writes in this
manier: My life fell down into the lake and they put a stone upon me. For ye
know that he was buiried in a sepulcher of stone, Luke. xxiii Mat. xxii d
Mark. xv d John. xix g
and that the mouth of the monume^te was shut with a mighty great stone,
because no body should take away his corpse. On the preparyng day well
toward euentide he was laid in his grave: there did he rest all the Sabbath,
that is to say, when the weorke of man's redemption was now finished, and
completed. Consider ye whether the prophecy did not foreshewe even of thissame
thing also: From the sight of iniquity (says the prophecy) was the
righteous taken away, and his place shall be in peace. Moreover until the
time of his death, he suffered himself to be touched of the wieked: after his
death he would not be handled ne touched of no body but of his friends. Neither
did he from that time forthward show him self to be seen, but only to his
friends. And of this matier had the aunciente prophecy of Jacob the patriarch,
given a dark significacion and tokenyng, who, when he should dye, prophesied
in this manier of Judah. Nay I should rather say of Christ: Thou layest a
long as a lion, who shall reise him up? Ferthermore like as it was his will to
dye, Gene. xlix.
and to be buiried, so that it should not come to pass that he should rotte
in his sepulcher, but that after tarying a very short time, he should arise
to life again, was it not a thing openly foreshewed of the prophets? does not
the holy ghost speak after this manier in the fifteenth psalm? Thou shall
not leave my soul in hell, nor shall suffer thy holy one to see corrupcion. No
spieces, no sweet baulmes do give this gift, that a dead carkesse shall never
putrify, forasmuch as continuance of time does forweare the verai spices
self, which time consumes even the monumentes, though they be of marble
stone, but this gift does resurreccion give, which gives immortality, but
all the whole figure of this matier did not Jonas the prophet many years
sense plainly present? The tempest was imputed unto him, Jonas. i. v.
and to intent lest al ye company should perish, he was headlong toumbled
into the sea, to the end that by the loss of him being but one man, the
tempeste might be alayed, whereas otherwise it threatened death unto all the
company. Christ dyed for the saving of all creatures, to the end that he
alone might pourge away the sins of all the people. Jonas was swallowed up
of a whale, and out of the bealye of the same whale was he rendered again on the
third day after, otherwise then all folks looked for: Christ was laid in
his grave, wherhence he promised that he would come forth on the third day.
For unto the Jews requiring a sign from heaven, he promised the sign of
Jonas the prophet, Mat. xii. c. Mark. viii. Luke. xi. d John. vi. d.
and that himself would after the exaumple of the same Jonas, come forth on the
third day out of the caves of the earth. And how many times did he repeat
this thing to drieue it into the disciples minds, that he should dye, and
return again to life on the third day? And that thing had Oseas the prophet
told long before, who said: After two days shall he revive us, O see. vi. a
on the third day shall he reise us again to life. Forasmuch therefore as ye
have hitherto seen all things agree together, the figures of the law, the
foresayinges of the prophets, the foretellinges of Christ himself, and finally
the end of things as they have from time to time followed and come to pass:
how happens that ye now, as men being half in a sloumbre or a dream, are
unbelievers, and do not rather of things already pas^e, conjecture things
afterward to ensue? He told you before, that betrayed he should be and
delivered to the Gentiles, that he should be bound, scourged, skorned, and
crucified.

Not one jot of all these things but it has come to pass. All the premises
ye have seen, and do believe them: but even he the verai same man, told also
before that on the third day he would arise to life again, and that he would by
the space of a certain of days, show himself not unto the world, but unto
his disciples. Wherefore than do ye not credit those weomen which report them
selves to have been adcertayned by the Angels, that he was arisen to life
again? Does the frailty and feblenesse of his body deceassed, so greatly
offend you that ye now fall into utter despair, as though al thatsame noble
promises of his were utterly extinct and dead, concerning his kingdom,
concerning the power of heaven and earth to be delivered unto the son,
concerning his ascending up into heaven, and his returnyng from hence unto his
father, concerning his sittyng at the right hand of his father, of extendyng
and spreding the gospel throughout all the nations of the world, concerning his
glorious cummyng a little before the end of the world, concerning the
immortality of the holy, concerning the everlasting pains and torments of
the wicked? Na^ wete ye well, that death it was which opened the way and
entreaunce into the majesty of all these things. Even as ye have seen him
dying and buried, so shall ye see him returned to life again, so shall ye see
him ascending up into heaven. Ye shall receive the spirit of God: ye shall see
the celestial power of god show forth it self in men of low degree, and of
no learning ne knowlage worldly: ye shall see the light of the gospel by
mean of the same persons in a litell time to sprede over all the world with
his ^adiaunt beams. And that same Jesus, who has here b^n set at naught,
spetted at, and had in derision, ye same Jesus shall all the world wurship, as
equal with God the father, and an eguall partener with him in his kingdom.
Finally all mankind without excepcion, shall see him in the majesty of his
father encoumpaced with coumpanies of Angels, iudgeing the quick and ye dead.
And it has pleased him that the cummyng of thatsame day should be
uncertain to all creatures. In the mean season his will was that his
servants should care for nothing but the kingdom of the gospel.

And all the premises have been foreshewed by the prophets: they have been
marked and appointed out by fygures of Moses law: they have been a great
portion of them, already performed: neither ought there any manne to doubt
but that all things shall in their due times be presently showed. These
words of the Lord Jesus mouth, not only striekyng the ears of the said
two disciples, but also percyng and thoroughly sinking into their hertes, did
so possess them, that neither they felt the travail of the way, nor took
any marks of his face while he spoke, nor yet remembered to think with
themselves in their minds, who is thissame that has the holy scriptures, and
all the doctrine and life of Jesus so prompte at his fingers ends, and the
which does in such wise hold us still, and moves the verai bottom of our
heart roote^ with talk of such efficacy and pith? This man did we never see
among the disciples, and yet does nothing escape him, but he knows it. They
did no more but cast a fancy of love unto him half in a dream, and had a
great delight to learn Jesus of Jesus self. For never is he with better luck
or success learned, then when himself vouchesalueth to teach himself unto
us.

Their journey being with this and other like co^municacion well ouerpassed,
they did now draw nere to the little town called Emaus. Than Jesus, because he
would the more enkiendle their desirefulnesse, fe^bled and made countenance as
though he would not make any tariaunce at Emaus, but made as though he had yet
somewhat ferther way to go, for the others, as men fallen in despatre had
forsaken Jerusalem, and were in returnyng home into their own country where
they were borne, whereas such persons as have truly believed in Christ,
have here in this world no parmanent city, but do by continual iourneyng make
haste unto thatsame other city celestial. But the said two disciples,
because they could not be plucked away from such a ioly talkyng companion on
the way, they pray him, they beseech him for Gods sake, they make al
possible instaunte request unto him, yea and in conclusion both with desyryng
which would not have any nay, and also with taking and holdyng him fast by the
cloak and vesture that he went in, whereas he refused so to do, they compel
him without choice or remedy to take lodgeyng with them that night, now
calling him by the name, master, not that they knew him to be Jesus: but
because that by his meruaylous talk they coniectured him to be no common
waifaryng man. And this said they unto him: Master, thou haste hitherto
showed thyselfe a sweet and friendly coumpanion on the way, now show thy self
also a like geaste unto us. Why would thou commit thyself to going of a
ferther journey? The euentyde now draws fast on, and the sun draws well
toward setting in the west. Of very good cause do they hate the night, as
many as love Jesus: and yet ought not such people to fear the night of this
world, as have Jesus to their coumpanion. And Jesus loves to be prayed to do
the thing, which he does with glad will? partly to the intent he may give
his gifts to persons ientilly deseruyng it, and worthy of it: and partly to
teach us a lesson, that a benefit or good turn is to be put in the lap,
and will he nill he, to be dooen to the neighbor being in necessitee. For
some persons do in such sort offer a good turn to the neighbor, as though
they were in fear, lest the party, to whom it is offreed* would not refuse
it: and they give it with such a countenance, that they seem to give it
against their stomakes. Jesus hereupon entreed the town, and vouchesalued to
use their courteous entreteinmente.

out of their sight. And they said between themselves: did not our hertes
burn within us* while he talked with us by the way, and opened to us the
scriptures? And they arose up the same hour and returned again to Jerusalem,
and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, saying:
the Lord is risen in deed, and has appeared to Simon. And they told what
things were done in the way, and how they knew him, in breakyng of bread.
The said two disciples being glad men of so great and noble a geaste, wha^
they had ministered unto him all manier of things which are wont to be
ministered to geastes that are welcome to ones house: they also laid a table
and made ready for supper, and as apperteined for men of their slendre hauour,
they set thereon for him such poor part as they had. The fare was competent
and mean without any excess: but above al things their countenaunces that
they set thereon, were good and frendely, and aunswerable to their most sincere
hertes. And now that Jesus was set at the table with them, As he sat at
meat h^ took bread and blissed it. etc
he took bread, he blissed it, and brake it, and than raught it forth to them.
And because they knew this guyse to be as a thing peculiarly used of Christ,
and no man else, that he would before meat give thanks unto the father, and
tha^ afterward he would break it with his own hands, and so distribute it
among his disciples: These two disciples (as it had been) suddenly awakened out
of sleep, begone both at once to think in their minds upon Jesus. And their
iyes were opened. etc.
And immediately the impediment that had hitherto been thereof, being now taken
away, they knew by that mark that it was very Jesus in deed. And while that a
certain sudden kind of being amazed entered into their hertes, Jesus vanished
away out of their sight. For after the time of his death forthward he did but
a little at once and after a sparing facion show himself in presence: either
for that the infirmity of mortal men was not hable to abide the majesty of
his body being returned to life again: or else because they might by litell and
litell enure themselves to lack the sight of his body, which was verai
shortly after to be had away from them to the end they should now love him
after the spirit. Ferthermore they have perfect marks to know Jesus, but in
the house, which is the church or holy congregation: they have no sure marks
of him, but when himself reaches forth unto them the bread of the word
evangelical. For he it is that opens the iyes wherewith Jesus is by sure
marks and tokens known. On the way had he broken and given them thatsame
bread after a mystical sort, when he opened the scriptures unto them. And the
thing that he had there dooen after the spirit, he did afterward renew by a
corporal and bodyly token. And when Jesus was in body goen, they did now
better see him, then at such time when he was in body present with them.
Their iyes were holden, because they believed not. Now when he is absent, they
see him with the iyes of their faith. After the departure of Jesus away from
them, And they said between themselves: did not our hertes burn within us?
they cease not to talk of Jesus between themselves, saying: how happened,
that it was so late ere we knew Jesus? A certain kind of sleep possessed our
minds: the blessyng of the bread, the breakyng and the geuyng of it unto us,
was the first thing that did shake away the same sleep: but had we not been as
men half a sleep, we might of his very talkyng with us even as well have
coniectured that himself was Jesus, in that he did with such a long process
so meruailously tell us so many things of Jesus. When he did in talkyng
familiarly with us on the way, expoune unto us out of the scriptures the
mystical derke speakinges of the figures and prophecies: did not we feel a
certain woondrefull feruentnesse of heart, such as the talk of the Scribes
and the Phariseis does not enge^dre the like in the hertes of the hearers? But
even of such like sort as this, are the lord Jesus words wont to be unto
such folks as hear them with a simplicity. His words or sermons would
prick the conscience, it would move the minds with affeccions, it would
rauishe, it would burn, it would inflame, and it would leave certain
sparcles and stynges or priccles behind it in the hertes of the audience. And
when they had both the one to the other confessed plainly that they had
both of like sort been strieken in their hertes, and did not now any thing
doubt but that he was very Jesus self returned again to life: they straight
way left Emaus although the day did now grow fast away, and with great
speed they got them back again to Jerusalem, to thentent that they might
make the other disciples also partakers of so great a joy, and that by mutual
conferring one with another, the feith of all the cumpanie might be confirmed.
For the lord has a great desire to have the benefits of his free gift in
such wise to be spread ferther and ferther abroad among men: that through their
mutual doing of good one to another, as well charity may grow among them, as
also good deserts may increase in them, which God may reward. They were
slow wha^ they leaft Jerusalem, because Jesus being one that kept talk with
them, beguyled them of felyng any werinesse of the way, and plucked out of
their minds, all desire of being in their hosterie. But the gredinesse as well
of bearyng tidings back again of that that had happened, as also of knowing
again on the other side what had befalle^ to the others, made them as light as
though they had had wings on their fete, when they returned back again to
Jerusalem. When they were come thither, And found ye eleven gathered together.
they found the eleven Apostles: (for now had Judas ben abated from the
noumbre of the twelve.) And with these eleven there were many disciples mo
present: who not tarying until these two had reported all their tale, leapyng
of their own mocion for joy, made relacion to the same, that after the
uncertain hope, which the women had first of all creatures made unto them of
the lords arisyng again from death to life: there was present knowlage come
that he was arisen in very true deed. For (they said) he had appeared unto
Simon Peter. The words of this Peter, because he was of a principal
estimacion among the Apostles, had more credit with the disciples, then the
words of women before. For it pleased the lord Jesus to cu^forte this Peter
first, and to confirm him with his presence, who^ he knew besides the evil
of unbelief which was in the rest also as well as in him, to be grieved with
the privy knowlage in his conscience of forswearyng his master. The two
disciples aforesaied being glad men of these news, do sembleably on their
part also make relacion, And they told what things had been done on the way.
how when they were on the way going toward Emaus, there came a certain
man being of none acquaintance with them, and joined himself together with
them in coumpanie, in the likeness of a wayfaryng man, who by taking an
occasion had told and recited many things of Jesus: repeatyng out of the
books of Moses and of the Prophets, whatsoever thing had been foreshewed
concerning Jesus, and also recityng what had fortuned, and what was afterward
to happen: and how they had no knowlage of him by any token till at last by the
peculiar and special custom that he had evermore tofore used to bliss, to
break, and to give bread unto the^.

Peace be unto you. It is I, fear ye not. But they were abashed and afraid,
and supposed that they had seen a spirit. And he said unto the^: why are ye
troubled, and why do thoughts arise in your hertes? Behold, my hands and my
fete, that it is even I my self. Handle me and see, for a spirit has no
fleashe and bones, as ye see me have. And when he had thus spoken, he showed
them his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not for joy, and
woondred, he said unto them: have ye here any meat? And they offered him a
piece of a broiled fish, and of an honey comb. And he took it, and did eat
before them. While they with such holy talks as these, do on both parties
counforte and glad themselves, some of them believing, and some yet still
doubting: the Lord Jesus suddenly entered in, when the doors were all shut,
and was not seen coming thither, but suddenly was standing even in the mids
among them. For in such like sort do the angels soodainly appear visible,
when themselves will, and again soodainly vanishyng away when them lyketh. And
as good spirits wha^ they appear, are accustomed with friendly and amiable
speaking unto men to take all fear out of them, to the intent that the
weakness of man's nature may not be any thing dismayed or troubled: right
so the Lord because he showed himself visible both suddenly coming in, and
also in the euentide being now we^ed verai dark, he speaks unto them with an
amiable salutacion, saying: Peace be unto you. It is I, fear ye not. This
speaking although it ought of good cause to put away all fear: And he said
unto them: peace be unto you. etc.
yet nevertheless so great was the weakness of some of the disciples, that
having their heart at their verai mouth for fear, they did not believe that it
was Jesus, but supposed themselves to see some spirit.

They had seen him not long before dead and buiryed, they saw him not to had
entered at the door, but to had appeared suddenly. Wherefore it could in no wise
synke in their hertes, that it was Jesus body that they saw, but some
spirit. For the common people report such manier fables, how yt the gostes
of dead folks do oftentimes appear to such as they will, and to represent to
mortal men's iyes a certain likeness of verai natural bodies, and yet not
to have any material and veraye body in deed.

Among these was Thomas, who unto the disciples reportyng that they had seen
the Lord, had said plainly that he would never believe it, except by puttyng
his fingers into his side, he had serched all the prientes and holes of the
nailles and of the spear. Jesus therefore to show an vndoubtable truth unto
them all, that both he was alive, and also bare about with him a very real
body in deed, and not any other body then the same which he had carried tofore,
said unto them: Why do ye yet fear me, as the sight of a ghost, seeing
that ye plainly behold me with your iyes, and know my favor of old, and
seeing yt ye hear my voice, being acquainted and familiar unto you, and yet
nevertheless do thoughts of unbelief and mystrustyng arise yet still in
your hertes, A spirit has no fleashe and bones, as ye see me have
even such like as are wont to come commonly in me^nes minds? Satisfy ye
every one of your senses: vieu and behold you my hands and my feet: they
have manifest prientes of the nails: touch and handle ye my side, it has
the gashe of the spear, feel ye my body and come nerer me with your iyes, and
leave ye suspectyng of any spirit. For a ghost has neither fleashe nor bones
as ye see that I have. That I entered in hither the doors being shut, that
when my will is I am seen, and when my will is I am invisible: it is not any
blyndyng of men's iyes by any sleyght, but the gift of the body being now
made immortal. And even such like shall your body also be, after the
resurreccion. When the lord had by such words as these taken away the
fear from the^, and had put them in a comfort: he showed forth unto them his
hands and his feet to be viewed: he opened his side that they might handle
the manifest dientes of the wounds.

For it was the lords pleasure to reserve the same, to the entente that by
those evident tokens he might than among his disciples perfectly auouche the
truth of his humain body, and also that he may in time to come at the last
day of judgment enbraide to the Jews their unbelief according to the
prophecy, which says: They shall see in whom they have perced and made
holes. Now whereas some there were yet still, which did not plainly believe it
to be the same body that they had seen dead, but were in case that a certain
inebriacion (as ye would say) of drounkenship or gladness did so hold their
minds, that they did neither perfectly believe their own iyes, nor their
ears, nor their hands (for often times we be afeard to believe the thing which
we do rather then our lives wish to be true, He said unto the have ye here
any meat?
as men fearing lest we should cast our selves into some fools paradise, or
false joy whereof to be anon after deprived again:) Jesus vouchesaluyng with
all tokens of evidence to be a Phisician to their unbelief, because there
should no spiece of the like mistrustfulnesse remain in us, said: Have ye any
thing here that may be eaten? For none there is a more undoubted token or
prouf of a man to be alive, then if the same take meat. And therefore Jesus
willed meat to be given to the damisell, Math. ix. Mark. v.c. Luke. viii.
John. xi.
wha^ she was called again to life, and sembleably also unto Lazarus: not that
we shall feel any hunger after that we be reised again to immortality: but
because he would (as that present time required) confirm and make euidente
unto his disciples, the verity of his humain body. There were present at that
time in the same place a good number of his disciples, and yet was there but
veraye small provision of viandrye. Therefore that that they had, they bring
forth, which was a morsel of fish that had been bruiled, and a honey comb.
Than Jesus in the sight of them al eat part of the things which were set
before him.

And when he had now made all their senses perfectely to believe that he was
no sight of any ghost, but a verai and a living man, even the same, who^ they
had tofore seen both living and also dying: he takes recourse unto the holy
scriptures, whereunto there ought credit to be given, although the se^ses of
man should never so much cry against it. Ye ought not (says he) to meruaill
at the things which ye see to have been done. The scripture cannot lie
forasmuch as it has been written by the inspiracion of the holy ghost.
Whatsoever thing has hitherto, been done, the same had been foreshewed and
prefigurate before in the books of Moses, in the prophets, and in the psalms.
For even I am very he, whom the figures of Moses law did signify: I am the
man, of whom the holy prophets promised so many things: and it is I, whose
first springyng up, whose progression or going foreward, and whose
co^summacion, the mystical psalms do describe: And with no less truth
shall all the rest of things also be performed, which have in the same
scriptures been foreshewed concerning my returnyng into heaven, concerning the
spirit of God to be sent: who, after that this body of mine shall be taken
away from you, shall make you the more steadfast concerning the gospel to be
spredde throughout the whole universal world, and concerning the last end
of this world. These are the things which I did so many times labor to
beat into your heads, when having yet a mortal body subject unto death, I
lived conuersaunt among you, being also mortal. At that time had not the
premises settled in your hertes: now can ye not any longer doubt when ye see
my sayings to agree with the mystical scriptures, and the cummyng to pass or
sequel of things to agree with them both. Hitherto (as the time has
required) I have tendrelye borne with the weakness of your fleashe, and I
have with gross proufes laid the truth of matiers before you. From
hensforthe grow ye forewarde to a spiritual understanding of the scriptures.
There shall ye from henceforth see me, there shall ye hear me. And because the
mystical books are not understood, except God open our mind and reason,
Jesus opened unto them, the iyes of their heart that they might read, believe,
and understand, that was written in the scripture. Than opened he their wits
that they might understand the scriptures. etc
For no man does understand scripture, but he that does believe it. In this
order (said Jesus) it has seemed good unto my father to restore mankind. And
the thing which he had decreed, has been set forth by his inspiracion in
books of holy scripture. The self same thing has been foreshewed by me
before it was done: neither was it possible that it should any otherwise come
to pass, because the determinacions of God are immutable, and the holy
scriptures can as little skille to lie, as the self spirit of God, by whole
instincte they have been written. By death, and by open shame of the cross,
the way did lie unto glory: it was necessary that I should arise again to
life on the third day, to the end ye might know your selfs to have a Lord
and an advocate being a liuesman, and one that from hensfoorth shall dye
no more. And the same your advocate being admitted into heaven, shall from
thence send unto you the spirit of god. And that repentance: and remission of
sins should be preached ^^ his name.
Than must ye in the name of Jesus Christ preach repentance of the life
past, and the remission of all sins without the keeping of Moses law. The Same
remission of sins shall be given to all people through evangelical feith
only. I have suffered the peines in the behalf of all creatures: leat them no
more but believe, and they shall atteigne the state of innocence. And these
things must be preached, not only to the Jews, but also to all nacyons of
the world: but yet provided always, that ye begin first with Jerusalem.
In Iewrye was I borne, and there have I wroughte miracles: at Jerusalem have I
taught, and suffered death. Among this people shall ye find hertes by means
and ways now already prepaired unto feith. And behold I will send the promise
of my father* upon you.
Unto these people shall ye renew the memory of the things which ye have
seen an heard. My doctrine which I first received of my father, and than
taught unto you, ye shall pour out again into them. The world will gainsaye
and withstand your testimony, like as it did vnceassauntly cry out against
me. But I (as I have heretofore said) will from my father send unto you the
spirit, which he long agone promised by the prophets, that he would send,
Iohel. ii. g Psalm. iiii. d
when he spoke by the mouth of Iohell. And it shall be: I shall hereafter
pour out my spirit upon all fleashe: and your soonnes and your daughters
shall prophecy: which spirit holy David also did wish for, wha^ he said:
But tarrye ye in the city of Jerusalem until. etc.
Send thou forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shall renew
the face of the earth. Thatsame spirit shall make you strong and invincible
against all terrors to be showed of this world. The Same spirit shall morouer
give you eloquence which no creature shall be hable to gaynesaye: he shall
also give you power to work miracles, in sort that your testimony concerning
me shall be a thing of condign pith and efficacy. Ye in the mean time until
than, be ye in perfect quiet and rest with yourselues, and being
congregated together in one coumpainie, remain ye in this city of Jerusalem,
beginning there the concord and unity of the church that shall spryng, up:
and exhort ye one another with holy communicacions, devoutly praying, and
geuyng thanks unto God, until thatsame spirit come from above, who shall
enstructe and arm you with power and strength celestial.

And lift up his hands and blissed them.
Herupon after that Jesus had by soondry euidente prouffes confirmed the
verity of his resurreccion: he led his disciples into Bethanie, and being
even now ready to depart from hence into heaven, he lift up his hands and
blissed them, representyng even in this veraye point also thexa^ple of the
patriarchs and of Moses. And in the same instaunte, while he wishes well unto
his disciples, he was lifted up from the earth, and in sight of them al was
carried up into heaven. Than the disciples falling prostrate on the ground
wurshipped the Lord, lookyng after him with their iyes as long as they might.
But much more did they look after him with their hertes, after that his body
was taken away from their iyes. The premises thus executed and dooen, they
returned to Jerusalem, according as the Lord had enjoined them, and return
they did with great joy. For now had feith shaken of from them all sorrow and
heaviness: and assured hope of the promises did give the^ cherefulnesse. In
the mean season they were much and often in the temple, And were co^tinuallye
in the temple, praising and laudyng god.
as men even tha^ already offreing evangelical sacrifices, praising and
magnifying the bounteous goodness of god toward mankind, and rendryng
thanks unto him, for that he had decreed freely to give such high benefits
unto mortal men, through his son.

FINIS.
To the most virtuous Lady and most gracious Queen Katherine late wife to
the most noble king Henry the eight of most famous memory deceassed, Nicolas
Udall your highness most humble servant wishes health, and all prosperitee
in Christ.
WHen I consider, most gracious Queen Katerine, the great noumbre of noble
weomen in this our time and countreye of England, not only given to the
study of human sciences and of strange tongues, but also so throughlye
expert in holy scriptures, that they are hable to compare with the best
writers as well in endictynge and pennynge of godly and fruitful treatises to
the enstruccion and edifiynge of whole realms in the knowleage of god, as also
in translating good books out of Latin or Greek into English for the use and
commodity of such as are rude and ignoraunte of the said tounges, I cannot
but think and esteem the famous learned Antiquitee so far behind these
times, that there cannot iustelye be made any comparison between them.
Cornelia a noble matrone of Rome through long conversation and continuance
with her learned housebande, was in the process of time so well learned and so
eloquent, that hirself was the chief and principal instructrice and brynger
up of her two sons Caius Gracchus, and Tyberius Gracchus in all their
learning, and made the same at length so fine, that they yet to this day
remain registered in the noumbre of the absolute and perfect Orators of old
time. We read of one Amesia in Rome a woman so well spoken and so fine of
toungue, that being on a time indicted and arrained of a grievous offense, she
so wittily, so piththily, and which such grace made answer for hirself: that
all the whole benche and Court than present, judged her, for ye mere respect
of her eloquence and wit in that present peril and ieoperdie there showed,
worthy by their whole co^sentes and sentences, to be quit and discharged of the
law for that crime. Hortensia the daughter of Quintus Hortensius, and brought
up continually from her cradle and tender infancye in the house and company of
such a noble Orator, came at length so nere to the perfect eloquence of her
father, that she was hable in public hearing to make oracions, and the same of
so piththye a sort, that where the noble weomen of Rome were on a time sore
taxed to depart with their gold, and jewels toward certain necessary
charges of that common weal: Hortensia came before the commisioners to speak
in the behalf of the matrones, and with her exquisite talk obtained a
mitigacion almost of the wholle tax which the sessours had before agreed
upon, and appointed unto the weomen to contribute.

These exaumples of eloquence in weomen, like as they are but very few in
noumbre, so are they things of no such high excellency to be meruailed at.
For what great matier of woondre is it that among so many thousa^des three or
four should be found hable to speak before a judge in open audience: or what
strange case is it to be reputed, if some one or two weome^ have been found
witty or learned in the Latin toungue being their own native language
which every carter and handicraftes man than spoke, though not al thing so
finely as the learned men and Orators did? what high matier of praise and
commendacion is it, if a few weomen being either wines or daughters to
excellent fine Latin men, could in continuance of a great many years
speak Latin well* yet are these weomen specialy chronicled in histories as
notable, yea and syngulare exaumples worthy perpetual fame and memory for
their wit, learning, and eloquence. After these heathens, Hiereme in his
Epistles writes special high praises and commendacions of Eustochium the
mother, Paula the daughter, and Blesilla the daughters daughter: of which
every one were passing well seen not only in holy scryptures, but also in
Latyne, Greek and Hebrewe: which toungues they learned exactely in a very
short time, and excelled in the same. The like testymony he gives of Marcella
a very noble woman in Rome, whom he reports to had in his time so well
profyted in the knowleage of holy scriptures, that after his departure from
Rome, if there were any doubtefull question or any point of difficultee
concerning scripture: all folks would resort to her as to a judge hable and
also sufficient to decise any matier of controversy or ambiguitee that
happened emonge them. But this knowleage extended no ferther then to the
private edifyinge of their own selves with a very few others, and the same in
such places where Latin was their mother toungue and their native language.
But now in this gracious and bliss full time of knoweleage, in which it has
pleased almighty god to reuele and show abroad the light of his most holy
gospel: what a noumbre is there of noble weomen (especially here in this
realm of England,) yea and how many in the years of tender virginity, not
only as well seen and as familiarlye traded in the Latin and Greek tongues, as
in their own mother language: but also both in all kinds of profane
litterature, and liberal arts, exactly studied and exercised, and in the holy
scriptures and Theology so ripe, that they are able aptely, cunnyngly, and
with much grace either to endicte or translate into the vulgar toungue for
the public instruccio^ and edifying of the unlearned multitude. Neither is it
now any strange thing to hear ientle weomen instead of most vain
communicacion about the moon shynyng in the water, to use grave and
substanciall talk in Greek or Latin with their housebandes of godly matiers.
It is now no news in England to see young damysels in nobles houses and in
the Courts of princes, instead of cards and other instruments of idle
trifleing, to have continually in their hands either Psalms, Omelies, and
other devout meditacions, or else Paul's epistles, or some book of holy
Scripture matiers, and as familiarlye both to read or reason thereof in Greek,
Latin, French, or Italian, as in English. It is now a common thing to see
young virgins so nouzeled and trained in the study of letters, yt they
willingly set all other vain pastimes at naught for learninges sake. It is
now no news at all to see Queen's and Ladies of most high estate and
progeny, instead of Courtly daliaunce, to enbrace virtuous exercises of
readyng and writing, and with most earneste study both erely and late to
apply themselves to the acquiring of knowlage, as well in all other liberal
arts and disciplines, as also most specially of God and his most holy word,
whereunto all christen folks, (of what estate or degree so ever they be,) ought
to the vttermoste of their possible powers, most principally and most
earnestly themselves to give and dedicate. But what a great cause of public
reioycyng (o lord) may it be, yt in this time of Christ's harneste, every
good body most busily applyinge the work of his vocacio^ toward the inning
of the lords corn, some by instructyng the youth, some by teaching schools,
some by preaching to their simple flocks, some by godly inducing of their
families, some by writing good and godly treatises for the edifying of such as
are willing to read, and some by translating good books out of strange
tou^gues into our vulgar language for the help of the unlearned: the most
noble weomen of blood and estate royal, are no less diligent trauaillours
then the best, (in any of the above named offices mete for their sex,) ne take
any manier skorne or disdeigne in ye labor of drawing this harvest home, to
be joined as y^kefelowes with inferior persons of most low degree and
condition. How happy art thou, o England, for whose behoufe and edifying in
Christ, Queen's and Princesses spare not ne cease with all earnest endeavor
and sedulitee to spend their time, their wits, their substance, and also
their bodies? And in this behalf like as to your highness, most noble Queen
Katerine, as well for composyng and setting forth many goodly psalms and
diverse other contemplative meditacions, as also for causyng these paraphrases
of the most famous clerk and most godly writer Erasmus of Roterodom to be
translated into our vulgar language, England can never be able to render
thanks sufficient: so may it never be able (as her deserts require) enough
to praise and magnifye the most noble, the most virtuous, the most wittye,
and the most studious Lady Mary's Grace, daughter of the late most
puissaunte and most victorious King Henry the eight of most famous memory,
and most derely beloved systur to the king our sovereign lord that now is,
it may never be able (I say) enough to praise and magnify her Grace for
taking such great study, peine and trauaill, in translatyng this paraphrase
of the said Erasmus upon the gospel of John at your highness special
contemplacion, as a noumbre of right well learned men would both have made
courtesy at, and also would have brought to wurse frame in the doing. O how
greatly may we all glory in such a pierlesse flower of virginitee as her
Grace is? who in the mids of Courtly delices, and emiddes the enticementes of
worldly vanities, has by her own choice and eleccion so virtuously, and so
fruictefully passed her tender youth, that to the public comfort and
gladfull rejoicing which at her birth she brought to all England: she does
now also confer unto the same the inestimable benefit of f^rtheryng both us
and our posteritee in the knowleage of Gods word, and to the more clear
understanding of Christ's gospel. O royal exercise in deed of virginly
educacion. O inestimable and precious fruit of maydenly studies. O noble
success of princely spending the time, especially in a woman. O zele of
prouokyng Gods glory worthy immortalitee of fame and renoume. For what could
be a more manifest argument of myndyng the public benefit of her country,
what could be a more evident proof of her will and desire to do good to her
fathers most dear beloved subjects, what could be a more plain declaracio^
of her most constaunt purpose to promote Gods word, and the free grace of
his gospel? then so effectually to prosecute the weorke of translatyng which
she had begoonne, that when she had with over peynfull study and labor of
writing, cast her weak body in a grievous and long syckenesse, yet to the
intent the diligent English people should not be defrauded of the benefit
intended and meant unto them: she committed the same weorke to Master
Frauncisce Malet doctor in the facultee of diuinitee with all celeritee and
expedicion to be fini^hed and made complete. That in case the kings majesty's
most royal commandment by his most godly iniunccions expressed, declared,
and published, (that the said Paraphrases should within certain months be
set forth to the Curates and people of this Realm of England) had not
so prevented her grace, but that she might eftsoon have put her fyle to the
poolishing thereof: where it is now already veraye absolut^ and perfeict, it
would than among the rude and homely dooinges of me and such, as I am, none
otherwise have glyttered, then clothe of gold enpowdred among patches of
canuesse, or Perles and Diamoundes among peoblestones. But in the mean time,
to what learned man may not the sedulitee of such a noble princess be a
spur and prouocacion to employe the talente of his learning and knowlage to
the public use and commoditee of his country? To who^ may not this most
notable exaumple of so virtuous a Lady, be an occasion to shake of all
sluggishenesse, and to yield unto the common weal of England some condign
fruicte of his study and learning? To what idle loiterer may not this most
excellent act of a kings daughter and the same a kings sistur be a shame,
and reproach of negligence? To what persons (be they never so ignorant or
unlearned) may not this most earnest zele of a princess of such high
estate, be an effectual prouocacion and encouragyng to have good mind and
will to read, hear, and enbrace this devout and catholyke Paraphrase so
plainly and sensibly translated, and so graciously by her offered, and (as ye
would say) put in all folks hands to be made familiar unto them? Besechyng
therefore almighty god that it may in the hearts of all good English people
take no less place, ne weorke any other effect of godly knowleage and innocent
living, then your highness in procuryng these tra^slacions, and the said Lady
Mary's grace on her party also have meant it: I shall sembleablye be a
continual peticioner to his divine Maiestee, long years to preserve both
your estates: you, to the procuring of many such good translacions for the
edifying of simple people in Christ's discipline, and her to the doing of many
like acts for the public vtilitee of us al, whereby ye may both of you
atteygne in this world condign fame and renoume with perpetual memory among
men, and after this life a croune of immortal glory and bliss in heaven
eternally there to reign with Christ and his holy Aungelles. Amen.

To the most renoumed Prince Ferdinando Archeduke of Austriege, and brother to
Charles the fifth, the Emperor of the Romans. Erasmus of Roterodam wysheth
health.
THe last year, most gracious prince Ferdinando, I took on hand to write a
paraphrase upon the gospel of saint Mathewe, more at the vrgente request of
the most reverend Lord Mathewe, Cardinal of Hedune, then of mine own
mind, partly because the great excellency of the work by a certain
reuerente fear withdrewe my mind from medlinge therwithall, partlye also
forasmuch as there was besides this, many and sundry difficulties, the which
might abashe my weakness (which did acknowleage his own in ability) from
medlyng with a treatise so far above my power, so that me thought I was
utterly dispatched of allsuche kind of writing: yet all this notwithstanding
I am compelled (I cannot tell how) after the same sort to declare the gospel
of saint John, partly by the success of my former bold enterprise partly by
the authority of certain noble personages, whose desire, if I should not
satisfy, I might be thought very unkind, and wicked also if I should disobey
their commandments: yet was it not unknown unto me how much more full of
godly majesty this present gospel was, the which for the most part does
travail in the declaracion of such secret mysteries, as unto the nature of
God does appertain, and the wonderful copulacion of the said nature unto
ours by his incarnacion. For what is he that can by very imaginacio^,
comprise how that God the father, being without beginning, does continually
beget God the son? in to whom the begetter does so wholly power out himself,
that yet thereby he is nothing diminished, of who^ also the said son is
after such wise borne, that yet thereby he is nothing secluded: again how
that from them both, the holy ghost does so proceed, that there continues a
perfect copulacion of one nature emo^gst them, without any confusion of the
distinct propriety in persons? Who can by wit atteyne to know by what
coniunccion the omnipotente and unspeakable nature by incarnacion, did couple
man's nature unto his: so that the selfsame which evermore had been very God
of the living God begotten, was also very man borne of the virgin Marie. In the
declaracion of such matters, in the which oftentimes, the bare transposing of
one word is an heinous offense, what liberty can a Paraphrase have? Above
all this I did perceive that I must go, if I did prosecute my purpose,
ouerplaces encumbered with many and sundry difficulties: hedged and diched,
parted and divided with fluddes, and gulfes, over the which it should not be
possible to pass by reason of thickets, and standing moates. For there is
none of all the gospels that has either mo, or more hard questions to be
solued, either in whom more vehement study has been bestowed of the old and
excellent autours: finallye in whose exposicion the interpreters do more varry
and descent, the which verilye I do not think mete to be imputed to their
dullness or lack of learning, but either to the obscurity of the style or
else to the diffusenes of things contained therein. There were besides these,
other peculiar difficulties in the said matter, because that all the words
which the Evangelist does attribute unto Christ, are intricate with
enigmaticall questions, the which if a man should express in wise of a
paraphrase, such things willnot agree with their answer, yt did not perceive
to what purpose Christ did speak so. For many things be spoken of Christ,
after such a sort, that he knew well that they neither could, neither
would he that they should be perceived until the conclusion of the thing did
declare his saying: Furthermore in as much as it is the office of a Paraphrase
to express that thing that is brefely spoken, and in few words couched, with
more copy and plenty of words, I could not observe ye due measure of time. For
where as it is read that our lord did keep his maundy upon the night time with
his disciples, and at the said time to have washed their feet, yet after
the same mau^dy he had so long co^municatio^ with his disciples, that it may be
thought a wonder that he had time to speak so many words, namelye seeing
that the words of the other Evangelists do declare that many other things
also were both said and doene by him the same night: wherefore dew measure in
time could not be observed of me, which should declare at large all the said
things with more copy and plenty of words. Finallye this Evangelist has a
certain peculiar kind of style of his own. For he does knit his style as
though it were ring and ringe joined and linked together sumtime with contrary
me^bres, sumtime with like, sumtime with one self thing sundry times repeted,
so that a paraphrase is not able to express such pleasant elegance of his
style: I mean such places as this: In principio erat verbum, and verbum erat
apud deum, and deus erat verbum. In the beginning was the word, and the word
was with God: and God was the word. In these.iii. places word after word,
and God after God is pleasau^tly repeted. And byan by repetyng again the
beginning, he concludes the sentence. Hoc erat in principio apud Deum. The Same
was in the beginning with God: and again: Omnia per ipsum facta sunt, and sine
ipso factum est nihil. Al things were made by the same, and without the same was
nothing made yt was made. Quod factum est in ipso vita erat, and vita erat fux
hominum, and sux in tenebris sucet, and tenebre came non comprehenderint. In him
was the life, and the life was ye light of men, and the light shines in
derkenes, and the derkenes did not comprehend it. In these it does appear how
that every membre of the sentence does always repete the former, so that the
end of the former begins the latter: and such a like thing may be
perceived here, as the Greek Echo is wo^t to represent: but as touching these
things, sumthyng have I spoken in the arguments of the Eua^gelistes gospels
and Epistles. This peculiar grace and elegancie of speech, I perceived well
could have no place in my paraphrase. Therefore although I did perceive these
and many other like difficulties, yet I took upon me this busye piece of work,
seeing that so many and noble men did by their exhortacion, encourage me
thereto, and by authority enforce me: specially because the good success of
my former dewtie and obedience, rather than any presumpcion, did bolden me to
the same. For I had not only good success forasmuch as the gentle reader for
my travail and pains does thank me, but also forasmuch as Charles (of al
Emperors yt for this eight hundredth years has reigned in this world, both of
most puissance, if we behold his large dominion, and also the most virtuous,
if we consider besides his other very imperial qualities, his fervent
affeccion and zeal toward religion and godlynes) has this my pains (for
unto him I did dedicate it) not only by countenance and words, but also by
letters both full honorably and lovingly written, certified me that it was most
thankfully accepted of his grace, where upon me thought it convenient that seeing
Matthew was to the Emperor Charles dedicate and presented: John should be unto
Ferdinando, the other and second Charles, dedicate. And plainly good hope does
greatly comfort my mind, promising me that it shall come to pass, that like as
my former labor by Charles good favor did well proceed, and had good success,
so shall this my present endeavor by the gracious favor of Ferdinando, proceed
and have lucky success. These be two names in our time most fortunate, a
couple of brethren in these days most lucky. Neither is it to be doubted,
think I, but yt the favor of God will prosperously set forth the godly purpose
of such so godly disposed princes. For a man may (as I think) have a good
opinion in them, in whom being yet of tender age, the excellent fruit of
virtue does satisfy ye great expectacion the which (if I might so call it)
the blading tender age did put us in comfort of. For in your very chyldage,
there appeared in you a certain strange and marvelous towardenes of such
prudencie, moderacion, mekenes, integrity, devotion and godliness that every
man did hope that your grace would be a wonderful excellent prince in every
condition perfect and absolute. And now as touching the public hope, that all the whole world has conceived of you, like as hitherto you have not frustrated
it, so have you brought to pass that now when you be come to the age of more
discrecion, it does appear that you will not only content and fulfill the
said hope and expectacion, but also the desire of all men to the vttermoste.
My little treatise of a Christian Prince, such as it was, for many days a go
when ye were a young man, you caused all studious persons to like, in as much
as ye did vouchesafe to read it. And this present work dedicate unto your
graces name, you shall likewise cause to be lyked, seeing that of all young me^
in our time you be the flower, and for many fold consideracions unto all the
world most derely beloved, neither shall ye so do either to advance your
glory and renoume, either to procure me any benefit or commodity, for neither
your noble estate, neither such a sober and moderate nature does covet or
look for the praise or commendacion of man, neither my mind or fantasy does
seek any thing else, then the favor of Christ, but that those for whose
furtheraunce these pains were taken (and for all men in general is my pain
bestowed) more plentifully might have commodity thereby. For such as be of
thieir own nature commendable, have then especial^ profit and singular
commodity, when they ouercum all malice, and be thought worthy the favor and
commendacion of all men. To this present purpose may your grace much help,
if you declare this my present work compiled by my pain and study, for to
have been not rejected of your graces majesty. For it is not to be feared, I
trust, lest your graces wisdom give credence unto them* the which
peradventure will say when they shall understand a paraphrase upon the
gospel to be dedicate unto prince Ferdinando, what should a lay prince and a
young manne do with the gospel? And will make cauillacion and say yt I give
frogs wine, as the Greek proverb speaks. As though it were to be thought
that only such do present princes with mete gifts, yt which bring unto them
books written in barbarous tongue, containing matters of huntyng, keeping of
dogs, and horses, of ingines for war, yea and mafortune of dising and
carding. Uerily I am in a contrary opinion: for I deame that where the
euangelical and heavenly philosophy is thought to be to all, of the highest,
lowest, and myddle estate, wonderful profitable, yet it is to none more
necessary, then to the supreme heads and powers of the world. For the more
weight, charge, and burden, that they sustain, the more dangerous the storm
is, that apperteineth unto them for to caulme and assuage, the more manyfold
occasions they have whereby good wits well inclined by nature, and well
instructed by educacion, may be marred and corrupted, so much the more it is
semyng that they should be instructed and armed more diligently then the
rest, with the most godly and infallible precepts of holy doctrine: for
such cannot offend without the great damage of the whole world. It is the
peculiar office of the prelates to nourishe ye people with plentiful and
abundant food of the evangelical doctrine. For the which cause they be called
pastors and herdes in scripture. I grant all these to be true. Yet the
poet Homer of the most commendable christian auctors is commended, and not
unworthily, because he calls a king, a herd over his people: how much more
then it is mete yt this name and title agree with every christian prince? A
prince does not preach and teach the gospel, but he does observe,
practice, and fulfill it, and yet does he after a sort teach it, whosoever
does keep and observe it. But how can he fulfill it if he know it not? how
shall he know it, except by diligente and frequent readyng he peruse it,
except with a great study he profoundly print it in his memory? whom behooves
more stedfastlye to believe yt the celestial king is governor of this world,
unto who^ nothing is unknown, whose iyes no man can deceive, whose power no
man can resist, who shall judge every man according to his merits, then the
supreme powers, which by reason of their power do dread no man, and can if
they list easilye deceive whom they list: which if they trespass any thing,
be not cited to appear at any mortal man's consistory, but be commended also
oftymes for their misdedes? In whose minds ought it to be more depely graven
that after this present life (whereof the kings themselves have no assurance,
no not as much as of an hour and which no man can enjoy long) there is to
come another life, that never shall have end: in the which indifferentlye
without respect of estate, or dignity, (saving that the strayter judgment
shallbe to them, straiter account shall they make, yt which in this world has
surmounted other in room office, and authority) every man shall by the
sentence of the most righteous and just judge (whose judgment no man shall
escape) reap ye croppe of that, which he has sown in this present life,
neither shall any escape but that either for his good deeds he shall receive
the croune of eternal glory and bliss, or else for his offenses be committed to
everlasting fire: in whose minds (I say) is it more necessary this thing to
be depely infixed, then theirs, whom al kind of prosperity and flatterye of
man, does provoke both to set their affiaunce in things present, and to
forget what is hereafter to come? In whose memory is it requisite more depely
to be printed, that Christ has plainlye threatenned us in these words, (woe be
to ye rich, and the high powers of this world, which has their comfort in
this world) than in theirs which have plenty, and store of all such things,
whereby man's mind is corrupt and degenerate? In whose ears is it more
convenient diligently to be beat that every man ought warely to bestow his
talent which the lord has committed unto him, in the way of usury, for the
lords advantage, and will call every man to make accoumpte thereof, then theirs
which by reason of their power committed unto them by God, may at their
pleasure, either profit most, or disprofit most in this world? Who ought more,
assuredly to believe that all men be they never so puissant and in high
authority, can of themselves do nothing, and that all things that be good and
comme^dable, do come of God, of whom al things ought to be desired, that may
by christian peticion lawefully be desired, and that unto him the whole glory
and praise of all that we prosperously do in our affairs ought only to be
attributed and ascribed, then they whom the world does comme^de and magnify
by reason they have such things as Christ taught should be despised? who^
because of certain vain and fantastical apparent shadows of things yt seem
commendable, ye base sort does in manner regard and wurship as gods? who
ought more thoroughly be persuaded, yt sternnes is hated of God, that injury
ought not to be revenged by injury, yt nothing is more commendable the^ peace
nothing more acceptable to God then meaknes and clemency, then such whom so
much busynes daily does provoke to unquietness, to war, and reuengyng of
displeasures? In whose mind ought it more depely be printed, yt neither for
desire of life, neither fear of death, it is lawful to swerve from honesty yt
in this present life no man ought to look for to be rewarded for his merits
and deserts, seeing that in the next world no man shall be defrauded of his
dew reward, then in the minds of princes, whom so many prouocacio^s, so
much troublesome business, so many occasions does often and many times entise and
allure to dishonestie? Uerely such a mind upon which y^ general felicity or
misery of the whole world does depend, ought with weighty and profou^d
persuasio^s of philosophy be armed: whereby it may uprightly and nothing
shrinking, persevere against all policies and engines of this world: but such
doctrine which does so peyse the mind that it be not tossed by the waves and
surges of fortune, and worldly business, no otherwise then the balans does
stay the ships in time of tempest, can neither more conveniently, neither of
more certain verity, neither yet of more efficacy and power be collected out
of any other work, then the ghospel of God. If ye profane princes, for as much
as they must commonly travail in worldly affairs, and maintenance of
public tra^quillite and rest, cannot always observe such things as they
perceive, and judge to be most convenient to be kept and observed yet at the
least if the euangelical doctrine be profoundly rooted in them, they shall be
able to do this, that forasmuch as liethe in them to do, they shall always
endeavor themselfes to approach nigh unto ye performaunce of Christ's
precepts, and little or nothing swerve from their mark. This thing as we
desire that it may appear in all such as be governors of this world, so most
gracious Prince Ferdinando, we greatly hope to se it in you, whom we have
known from your childeage hitherto, to have been maruelously given to the
readinge of the gospel for you were not wont, while the priest is at service,
to spend your time either in supersticious kind of prayers, either
vnfruitfulia^gling as the most part of nobilite does, but to open the
testament, and reverently to se what the epistle and gospel of that day does
instruct and exhort you to do. Neither do we doubt but that this example of
your childage, you have much increased by increase of age. Neither do we
mystrust but that in time to come in every place, many other will follow this
your exaumple. For like as an infeccion of vice taken at the example of men of
estate, does spedely crepe unto many: even so the example of virtue, if it
have his beginning of renoumed persons, will soon be well lyked of all men. In
what estimacion the word of God was had in old time, may evidently appear by
those rites and ceremonies as yet be used in the church, left unto us of old
antiquity. The book is adorned truly with gold, iuery, and precious stones,
reserved and laid up devoutly emo^gst ye jewels. It is not brought forth ne
carried in without great reverence. The gospeller desirethe license of him that
does execute, that he may read and pronounce it. After that, there is caused
an holy perfume by censing of frankincense, of stacten, the droppyng of mirrha,
of mirrha it self, and of the powder of the herb galbanum. The forehead and
breast has the sign of the cross made upon them, glory is given to the lord
down to the ground, every man arises and stands bolte upright, the heads
be bar^, the ears attentife, the iyes full of reverence. At the name of Jesus
as often as it is mentioned, the knees be bowed down to the ground, after all
this with great reverence he holds the book before his breast, and carries it
about, every man does kiss it, and at the last it is reverently laid up
amongst ye relics. What other thing does these ceremonies mean, or put us
in remembrance of, than yt nothing ought of christian men to be more regarded,
more derely beloved, more reverently handled, then that celestial doctrine,
which Christ has preached unto all persons: the which for so many hundredth
years ago, the consent of the whole world has allowed, the which against this
world, and the prince thereof, makes us to prevail? but like as wurthely the
vain and misordred devotion of the Jews is reproved, which Jews do great
reverence unto the book of their law the old testamente, in laying pure and
clean clothes under it, knelyng down to it, and wurshipping it, not once
touching it, but with clean and undefiled hands, (where as such things as
their law does chiefly teach them, they wickedly contemn and despise) so it
is to be perceived of us, that we be not as undevout in keeping and fulfylling
the ghospel, as we be supersticious and scrupulous obseruers of the rites and
ceremonies. For what does it avail to have the book adourned with Iuorye,
silver, gold, and sylke, if our living be polluted and infected with such
vice as the gospel does so straytely forbid? if our soul be decked with no
virtue according to the gospel? what can the book avail us borne before our
heart, if the doctrine of it be not in our heart and mind? what service does
the perfume and odor caused by censyng, if that his doctrine be contemned, if
our living have a daily pestilent sauer? what the better be we to bow down
our neck to the book, if our lusts obstinately and with stiff necks repine
at his precepts? what does it profit and avail us to rise up, and to stand
bare headed, if al our whole life be such that it declare openly that we
despise the doctrine of the gospel? how dare ye be so bold as to kiss the
book that the gospel is in, the which being subject to lecherye, to
auaryce, to ambicion, to sensuality, and ire, do defile and dishonest the
admonicions of the gospel? how dare he kiss the book that teaches nothing
but peace, but meekness, and charity, the which despysyng Christ's doctrine
is wholly consumed with envy, replenished with hatred, boyleth in anger,
inflamed with desire to be revenged, furious and mad against his neighbor,
the which also (so his mind may be satisfied) forces not by wood battle
to set all the world by the ears together? how dare he be so impudente as to
embrace and wurshippe this holy book, the which in all kind of living and
conversation is utterly given and married unto this world, which as a mortal
enemy, the doctrine of the gospel does detestate and abhor? with clean
hands and very reuerentlye we use to touch the holy book of the gospel, and
with filthy minds do we despise the precepts of the gospel: why do we not
rather lay the^ to our heart? why do we not kiss them with mind and pure
affeccion? why do we not here boewe down our necks; Certain there be that has
hanging about their neck, and cariethe about with them a part of S. John's
gospel, as a remedy against diseases, and such other heavy misfortunes. Why
do not we rather bear about with us the doctrine of the gospel in our
mind, the which may remedy al disease of sin and vice? I do not
discommend any ceremonies, I do not rail upon the devotion of the simple
people: but plainly* tha^ will th^se said things profit us, if we put in
practyse that thing which the visible signs puts us in remembrance of.
If we be true christien men, that is to say, if we unfeignedly profess the
doctrine of the gospel, let us inwardlye in our minds practice all such
things as in those signs is outwardly represented unto us. I have heard say
that it is a fashion in some places that the prince shall all the gospel time
stand holdyng a naked sweard in his hand, the rest laying their hands upon
the hyltes. How shall he defend the gospel with the swearde, whose mind
doethe hate the gospel, which is wholly affeccionate unto the vanities of this
world, in whose opinion nothing is less regarded then the excellent precious
perle of the gospel, of whom nothing is more hated, then that which
Christ taught only to be coueted? He that pouleth the people, that
oppresses the poor, that by war defaceth all both good and badde, he that
is the occasion of many fold calamities, for whose vain glory so much
man's bloudde is shed, does he, I say, draw his swearde to defend
Christ's gospel withal: let him first be made at one with the gospel, let
him cut away his vicious and naughty appetites out of his mind with the
swearde of the gospel, and then if he list, let him draw his swearde
against the ennemies of the gospel. But these things have I spoken, most
renoumed Prince, in the way of advertisement, without reproach of any person.
I open the matter only. I reprehende no person: and the more boldelye unto
your grace I write thus, because no kind of suspicion at al, of any such
fault or enormitee, can be suspected to be in you. There be none, Bishops
except that of congruence ought to live more after the gospel then Princes.
But they oftentimes by simplicity under an assemblaunce of devotion be
deceived. For by the persuasion of such which be thought the perfect
professors of religion, they ofttymes esteem it a point of great perfeccion,
if they daily say over their prayers the which they call their mattens, if
they see a mass every day once. The which things as in a lay prince and a
young man also, I grant is a certain token and sign of a well disposed mind,
yet be there many other things yt which do more straightly appertayn to a
christian princes office the^ these. For if he foresee that no storm of war
arise, that the public liberty be not diminished ne violated, that the poor
comminaltie be not compelled to famishe, that no naughty officers be made and
permitted, in my opinion he shall do a more acceptable service to God, then if
he should say these praieres* vi. years together. Yet do I commend the said
things if that which is more principal be coupled and joined thereto. But
and if a prince do suppose that he lacks no portion of godly perfeccion,
putting his confidence in the obseruacion of those things, setting a part
such things which do peculiarly appertain unto a kings office and duty,
plainly that is the confusion of all religion, that is the subversion of the
commonwealth: and they that give such council do neither give profitable nor
wholesome council for the prince, neither yet for his subjects. It is a good
deed to hear service, if they be pure yt do it: but how can I cum in pure life
unto the sacrifice done in remembrance of the true and highest prince, the
which for to redeem his servants bestowed his own life, if through my fury,
my vain glory, and negligence, so many thousand men be either vexed or
utterly perish? I think it not needful to show that for the most part
princes be never at more leisure, neither less careful, then when they be at
divine service. What great thing is it, if a prince say those prayers at an
hour prescribed therefore, which cannot have sufficient time and leisure to
order and disposes affairs of a common wealth? A prince shall pray enough at
full, if he say daily and recite from his heart, the notable prayer of the
wise king Solomon. Lord give me wisdom and knowledge how to behave my self
unto thy people. Or the other prayer much like unto the same, the which the
wise man, as I remember, recites in the book of wisdom. Give me wisdom
which is ever about thy seat, that she may be with me, and labor with me,
that I may know what is acceptable in thy sight, for she knowethe and
vnderstandethe all things, and she shall lead me sobrely in my works, and
preserve me in her power: So shall my works be acceptable, and then shall I
govern thy people righteously, and be worthy to sit in my fathers seat: who
can have knowledge of thy understanding and meaning, except thou give
wisdom, and send thy holy ghost from above, that the ways of them which are
upon earth, may be reformed, that men may learn the things that are
pleasant unto the? This wisdom that this most wise young man desires to
have, may a man chiefly find in the holy scripture, if a man list unfeignedly
and with a godly curiosity seek to have it. Otherwise, how is it cu^ to pass
that christen men's behavior and manners partly be decayed into a conversation
wurse then the Gentiles or Ethnickes were, partly degenerated into a certain
Iudaical supersticion, but by reason that the doctrine of the gospel has not
been had in regard? Notwithstanding to say the very truth, in all times
there has been ever sum, of whom the gospel has been had in due honor
and reverence, yet nevertheless for this four hundred years past, the lively
heat and feruencie thereof, has been greatly abated with the most part.
Wherefore the more we ought to the vttermoste of our power, endeavor our self
that every man for his part do revive thissame sparkle of heavenly fire again,
the which the eternal verity Jesus Christ our Lord has sent down into the
earth, wishyng nothing else but that it may be feruentlye kyndled, and in great
circuit to spread it self abroad, and be set all on fire. In this our time
when man's conditions be so corrupted and of so great dissencions in opinions,
whereby at this hour all things be confounded and out of order, whither shall
we rather flee to have redress, then as S. Hilarie does well admonish us,
unto the most pure fountain and well spring of holy scripture, whereof the
most pure and vnderfiled part be ye gospels. Neither ought the gospel to be
mislyked of the supreme powers for this cause, as though it did as sum say,
cause such to be sedicious and disobedient, whose part and duty is to be
obedient unto their princes: nay it rather profits princes in this point,
insomuche as it does teach them to execute the true offices of princes, and
not to be tirauntes, and causes the people more gladlye to obey every good
prince, and more quietly to tolerate and bear with the bad. Finally the
gospel is not to be blamed, if any man do not use all of the best, that thing
which of his nature is most excellent, and the very best. It is called the
gospel of peace: reconcilyng god and us to unity, and secondlye couplyng
mutual love and amity between each of us together. If any man stumble at this
stone, let him blame himself and not the gospel. There is no power that man
has, no policy, no co^spiracy or coniuracion together, that is able to
^anquishe and oppress the verity of the gospel, which most mightily sets
forth it self, when it is most grievously persecuted. But as touching these
matters I fear me I have heretofore spoken enough and to much. Now that this
paraphrase may with the more fruit be red, after I have spoken a word or two
of the evangelists intent and purpose, I will make an end. After that the
life and doctrine of our Lord Jesus Christ by thapostles preaching and the
other Evangelists wrytinges was spread at large over all the world, the
Evangelist S. John whom Christ so notably loved, after all the other took on
hand to write this present gospel, not so much for thentent to compile the
history of the gospel, as to make rehersall of certain things omitted by the
other evangelists, because they seemed not unworthy to be known: But the
especial cause why that he wrote this gospel, men suppose was to set forth and
confirm the godhead of Christ against the heresye, which even in those days
(as evil weeds amongst good corn) begun to spring, and namely against the
heresye of the Cerinthians, and Ebeonites, the which beside other erroniouse
doctrine, preached that Christ was nothing else but man only: nether that he was
in any wise before he was borne of ye virgin Marie. Now it was very necessary
that the world should know and believe Christ to be both very god, and very
man: of which two, the former article does principally help to inflame the
love of man toward him: for the better we know a thing, with the better will we
do love it: seco^darily it does cause us to have more fervent courage to follow
the steps of him. For who will attempt to follow and cou^terfait yt thing which
is done of an angel by a vision and apperaunce only and not in very deed?
furthermore like as it is hard to observe ye things which he commands, eue^
so the things be excedyng excellent that he promises: it was therefore
requisite also, that his godhed should not be unknown, to thentent yt we might
have co^fydence yt he undoubtedly would help his servants who^ he after such
sort did love, neither will defraude them of his promise, yt which is able with a
beck to do what him list. The Eua^gelistes yt wrote before S. John, made in
manner no mention of the diuinitee of Christ. For I think this to be the
wisdom which s. Paul used to speak emo^gst ye perfect, emo^gst the rest
professing himself to know nothing else but Jesus Christ and him to be
crucified. Mafortune as then ye time did not suffer so inexplycable a mystery
to be put in writing to al men's knowledge, lest it should be had in derisio^ of
ye wicked, because they could neither believe it, neither understand it. For in
other matters also the old ancient auctours as often as they make mention of
heavenly things, do use to speak both very seldom and very reverently
thereof, being more copious in such things as do more profit and appertain
to godly living. The Apostle S. John was constrained therefore by the indiscreet
boldenes of the heretics, more plainly and evidently to affirm both the
natures to be in Christ, like as by the bold presumpcion of the Arians, the
catholyke fathers were enforced more precisely to discuss certain things as
touching the same matters where as they would rather not have meddled with the
diffinicion of such matters, which both does greatly pass the capacity of
man's wits, and cannot be determined without great danger and peril. But
as for this matter not without consideracion it was reserved for S. John so well
beloved of Christ, and so well worthy, whom as he that is the well of all
wisdom did love above the rest more ferue^tly, so is it to be believed that
the same did more plentifully reuele and open certain secrets and mysteries
unto him (if I may so call him) his so well beloved dearlyng. Him therefore so
derely beloved of Christ, let us all profoundly and groundely understand, that
we for our part may be the lovers of Christ. Well of this one thing and no
more, I will put the reader to acknowleage, that in this present Paraphrase I
follow the mind of most allowed old autours, but not in every place, neither
in every thing: for they themselves do often descent among themselves, yet do I
always sincerely and faithfully, declare and bring forth that, the which me
thinks is the most true sense and meaning, for as much as I did perceive
that the old auctours contendyng against the opinion of heretics, have
wrested some places something violently to their purpose, yet it is not my
mind that any manne give more credence to this my Paraphrase, then he would
give to a commentarye, if I had written one upon it, notwithstanding a
Paraphrase is a kind of a commentary. As for allegories in the which I
perceive the old auctours to have been very scrupulously and supersticiously
diligente, have I not meddled withal, but very seldom, neither more copiously
then me thought convenient. Farewell redoubted prince, and with all your
endeavor, favor and set forth the glory of the gospel, so almighty Christ
of his part graciously assist you in all your desires.

Saint John's life Written by Saint Jerome.
John the Apostle whom Jesus loved tight well, being the son of Zebedeus, and
James the Apostles brother, whom after the Lords death Herod had beheaded,
wrote his ghospel last of all ye rest, being desired thereto by the bishops of
Asia, both against Cerinthus, and diverse other Heretics, but principally
against the opinion of the Ebeonites, which even than arose, which Ebeonites
auouche that Christ was not before Marie: by reason whereof he was enforced to
show even his divine nativity. They say that besides this, there was an other
cause of his writing, because that when he had red the volumes of Matthewe,
Mark, and Luke, he well allowed the text of the story, and affirmed that they
had said the truth, but had only made their stor^ of one years acts, in
which after the imprisonmente of John, Christ suffered. Wherefore omitting
that years acts, which were sufficiently entreated of all three, he showed
such things as were done before John was imprisoned. Which thing may
evidently appear to such, as shall diligently read the volumes of the four
gospels: the which thing also does take away the disagreyng that seems to
be between John and the rest. He wrote besides the premises one Epistle, which
begins thus. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
we have seen with our iyes, etc. The other two which begin. The elder to the
well-beloved Lady and her children. etc. And the elder to the best beloved Caius,
whom I love in the truth. etc, are affirmed to have been written of John the
priest, whose several toumbe is at this day to be seen at Ephesus, and many
suppose that there are two memorials of this same John the Evangelist, of
which matter we will entreat, after we shall by order come to the life of
Papias his scholar. In the fowertenth year than, at what time Domicianus after
Nero styred up the second persecucion. Ihon being banished into the Isle of
Pathmos, wrote ye reuelacion, which is entitled the Apocalipsis, which Iustine
the martyr, and Hireneus do make commentaries upon. But after Domician was
stayne, and all his acts revoked by the Senate, because of his over much
cruelty, he returned to Ephesus, in the time of prince Nerua: and continuyng
there until the time of the Emperor Traiane, he instituted and governed all
the churches of Asia, and there continued till he was impotente for age. He
dyed the three score and eight year after the passion of the Lord Jesus, and
was buried a little beside the same City.

The paraphrase of Erasmus upon the gospel of saint John.
The first Chapter.
BEcause the nature of God does pass beyond measure the weakness of man's
wit, although in other things it be right good and of quick sight, yet that
divine nature can neither be perceived with our senses, as it is in deed, ne
conceived in mind, imagyned nor expressed with words. And although in
things create, certain apparau^ce of godly power, wisdom, and goodness is
showed, and so it comes to pass that the similitudes brought forth of
those things, which we do sumwhat perceive with our senses and wit, may
bring us into sum small and shadowelyke knowlage of incomprehensible
things, that we may behold them as it were in a dream and a cloud, yet that
not withstanding no similitude may be taken out of any things create,
whether ye behold the Angels, the woorkemanship of the heavens, or else these
inferior bodies, which although they be familiare to our senses,
nevertheless we cannot fully perceive them: no similitude I say, can be
brought forth of any of these forsaied things, which may in all poynctes
agree to the reason and nature of those things, of the which for to attain
the knowelage, those comparisons are brought in place. Therefore it behooves
manne to apply all the study of his mind to this, that he may rather love the
goodness of God, then meruail at, or comprehend his highness, which neither
Cherubin or Seraphin does fully attain to. And although God cannot but be
meruaylous in all his works, yet he had rather be beloved of us for his
goodness, then to be meruayled at for his excellency. But the more full
knowlage of the divine nature is reserved in the world to come for them,
which have purged the iyes of their heart here, through godliness of innocent
life. No man knows the father as he is in deed but the son, and such as
the son will manifest him unto. Therefore to search the knowlage of Gods
nature with man's reason, is presumptuous boldness: to speak of those things
that cannot be expressed with words, is madness, to give judgment thereof,
is wickedness. If we have grace in the mean while to behold any part
thereof, it is more truly comprehended with pure faith, then with the help of
man's wisdom. And in the mean time it is enough for to attain eternal
salvation, to believe those things of God, which he did openly set forth of
himself in holy scripture, by men chosen for that purpose, which were
inspired with his spirit: and such things as he himself afterward being
conuersaunt in yerth, opened to his disciples: and last of all has vouchsaued
to declare manifestly by the holy ghost to the same disciples chosen for that
intent. To believe these things simply and truly, is christen wisdom, to
reverence these things with a pure heart, is true religion: By these things to
go forewarde unto the meditacion of an heavenly life, is godliness: to
continue and persevere in these things, is victory: to have had the victory
by these things, is the whole sum of felicity. But for man to search of
godly causes with man's reasons ferther then things, is a certain perilous and
wicked boldness. And although it seemed to be enoughy yt was both truly
preached and set furthe in writing of the other Evangelists, which declaring
in order the nativity of Jesus Christ as concerning his manhed, life, and
death, did affirm him to have the true nature of man: and ferthermore by
declaringe his sermones, rehersinge his miracles, and resurreccion from death,
did so declare his godly nature as that time required: speaking nothing all
that while of his divine nativity, by the which he was borne by an
unspeakable way of his father without beginning: and refreyninge also to call
him manifestly by the name of God, to thintente that neither the truth should
be hidden from those that were godly disposed and easy to be taught, neither
occasion should be given to the weak and untaught Jews to go back from the
doctrine of the gospel, which had vttrely persuaded themselfes by the
tradicion of their elders, and also out of Moses holy books, that the name of
God could not be rightfullye attributed but only to God the father, whom
they had always wurshipped. And besides that also lest the gentiles, which
did wurshippe innumerable gods, yea gods made of men, should have taken
occasion to continue in their perverse error, if they had perceived that in
the gospel the name of god had been made common to many, which thing the
^ares of the Jews not hable to receive this mystery (as thinkinge that name to
be approiprate but to one) at the first could by no means have borne. And
the mind of the Gentiles being brought up in the opinion of many gods,
could not at the first be perfeictly taught, that there were three divided
in propriety of persons, of the which three every one was very God: and yet
three was but one God* by the occasion of one godly nature, which was common to
all three equally. Yet thus it has pleased God that to thintente the faith of
the gospel should be the more stablished he, would have it declared to
mankind by little and little, as should best serve the time and man's
capacity. So the nation of the Jews did wurshyppe God the father devoutly
many hundrethe years, being ignoraunte both of the son and the holy ghost.
And the son of God himself when he was herein yerthe averay man, and (as we
can witness) did hungre, thirste, sleep, sorrow, weep, was displeased, and had
compassion, long suffered to be reputed for none other but manne, yea even of
his own disciples. Also after his resurreccion he would have them ignorant
in some things. In so much that by the holy ghost he did not open all things
to them, but those things only, which helped forward the persuasion and
belief of the euangelical doctrine and salvation of mankind. For considering
that the nature of godly things is in comprehensible, yea to the highest
wits of men or Angels, and the profession of the gospel pertainethe
indifferently to all men, the heavenly father has opened unto us so much of
godly things by his son, as he has willed to be sufficient for the
obtaininge of our salvation. Therefore it comethe of a certain perilous
presumpcion to affirm any thing of the godly nature more then that which
either Christ himself, or the holy ghost have opened unto us.

But because in these days, as the wheat of gods word has grown in the
hertes of good folks, so also the cockle of the wieked has ouergrowen, whose
cursed presumpcion has braste out so far, that some has not ben afraid to
take from Jesus Christ his manhed, bringing instead of man, a vain vision and
similitude of man: Some contrariwise would take from him his godhed, falsely
saying that his beginning was but than, when he was borne of the virgin Mary:
because they being blinded with yerthly affeccions, could not attain the
mystery of Gods counsel, how very God took upon him to be very man, that
one person should be both, that in the mean while nothing should be
withdrawn from the immutable nature of god, and yet the perfectness of his
manhed should still remain. I shall therefore set forth sum things more
plainly in the gospel, so much as the spirit of Christ has vouchsaued to
open unto me, and as much as he had thought sufficient to obtein salvation
by, through the faith of the gospel. But as I began to say, forasmuch as
there is nothing any where emonges all the things that ever God made, whereof
we may make comparison which can thoroughly agree with the truth of the godhed,
I must (though improprely) use the terms of things that our understanding is
acquainted with, to the intent that I may give some knowlage to other, of things
which passes all men's understanding and vtteraunce. Therefore as holy
scripture calls God that most excellent mind, which mind is both greatter
and better then all things that can be imagined: even so it calls his only
son, the word of that mind. For although the son be not the same that
the father is, yet he is so very like the father, that a man may see the one in
the other, that is to say, the father in the son, and the son in the
father. But the resemblaunce of the father, and the son, which in man's
generation is many ways imperfect, is most perfect in God the father and his
son. And there is nothing which does more fully and evidently express the
very secrecye of the mind, then the true declarynge of it by word, for that
is the very loking glass of the mind, which cannot be seen with bodily iyes.
And if we couete to have any man know the will of our mind, that thing is
brought to pass by no means more certainly or quickly, then by speech:
which being fetched out of the inward priui^ies of the mind conueiethe by a
certain secret efficacy, the mind of the speaker into the mind, of the
hearer, through the ears of the hearer. Neither is there any thing among
men more effectual to stire up every mocion of their minds, then to vttre it
by speaking. For and if we have authority, we may shortly appoynte with our
word what we will have done. Therefore he is called the son, because being
equal in all other things with his father, he is distinct^, and differs in
only propriety of person. He is called the word, because god, which in his
own proper nature can no ways be comprehended, would be known to us by him:
neither was his pleasure to be known for any other cause, but to thintente we
might attain everlasting felicity by the knowlage of him. This birthe is not
temporal or during but for a time, ne yet this word is like to man's word.
There is no corporal thing in God, nothing that passes with time, or can be
contained in place, neither is there in him any thing at all subject to
beginning, proceeding, age, or any mutabilitie, he is always one, whole, and
altogether in himself, and the son is continually begotten of him even such
an one as he is himself: eternal, of him that is eternal, almighty, of him
that is almighty, most good of him yt is best: in conclusion God of God:
neither later in time, nor inferior to his father: the everlasting word of
the everlasting mind, by the which the father speaks to himself al ways as
it were by a secret thought, yea before the world was made, being known to no
body, but only to himself and his son. He did evermore and shall begette the
son in himself, and in like wise did evermore bring forth his almighty
word, he had no need of any thing that is create, to whose felicity
nothing can be added: but of his natural goodness he has made this whole
ingine of the world, and set therein evangelical minds, and mankind as in the
mean between angels and beasts, to thinthent he might gather of things
wunderfully create, and also of himself, the power, the love, and goodness of
the makir thereof. And as if there were a great mighty king, whatsoever he
commanded to be done should be done by and by: even so the veraye almightye
father has made all things by his son and word. And first by this way he
showed forth his word by whom he would be known, as though he had spoken
unto us himself. And being so known by the wonderfulnes ^f his most fair
workmanship, might wind himself into our inward mocions. Therefore they do
err and go very far from the truth, which think the word of god to be so
after him in time, from whom it proceeds, as emonges us the mind goethe before
the speech. And so they also which take the word of God (by the which God
the father has made all things,) to be numbered emonges things create. But
their error is more rude and gross, which do suppose the son and word of
God than to have begun and never before, when he was borne bodily of the virgin
Mary. What thing soever is create has his beginning in time, but the son of
God was twice borne, once of his father before time, or rather with out time,
very God of him that is verily God: Again he was borne of the virgin Mary in
time appointed thereto eternally of the everlasting father, The word was with
god. etc.
very man of mankind. For it has pleased God after this sort to bring
furthe again to us his word, that is to say his son, to thintente he
might be known after a more plain way, or more familiarly. That person
therefore is wicked which makes argument that Jesus Christ was nothing else
but manne, or that contendethe him to have been create emonges other
creatures. An accide^t is a thing that may be or not be without corrupcion of
ye wherein it is, as for exaumple: one may take away the whightnes of a wall yet
the substance does still remain.
The father did be get him that was both his son and his word, and yet all
one, after soundry ways, once in time, as touching his manhed, and always
without all time, as touching his godhed. For before there was this
universal creacion of things, both yearthly and heavenly, the eternal word
was already with the everlasting father. And this word did so proceed from
the father, that yet it remained still with the father. He was of such an
inseparable nature with the father, that by propriety of person he was with
the father: And yet he did not cleue to the father, as the accidente does to
the substance: But he was god of god, he was god in God, and he was God with
God, by reason that they both had but one divine nature common to both. They
twain were so both one that nothing made difference between them saving
only the propriety of person of the father and the son, of the speaker and
the word that was spoken: like as he was the only beegotten son of his
only father, so he was the only word of the said father, being thereof the
only speaker.

And albeit this word was God, being almighty of him that was almighty, yet
differing in propriety of person, not by unlikeness of nature, he was with god
ye father, not brought forth in time, but before all times: so always
procedyng from the fatherly mind, that nevertheless he never departed from
the same. Neither was he create of the father, but the father made all things
that be create both visible and invisible, All things were by it. etc.
by this his word, being likewise eternal as he is himself. By the same
word he governs all things, and by the same he has restored all things,
not vsyng it as an instrument or minister, but as a son, of the self same
nature and virtue, that he is of: to thinten^ that all manier of things should
come from the father, as the excellent auctour and maker of the same, but by the
son, whom he had eternally begotten, and shall be get without end, like to
himself in all things.

And this word of god had might and power not only to make all things in
general both visible and invisible at his will and pleasure, as it were with a
beck, but also in that word was the life and strength of all things that
were create, that by the same every thing should have his natural strength and
force: and by the might which was once given to them, save themselfes in their
kind, by continual generation. For there is nothing idle or without use
emonges so great a multitude of things: Every herb and tree has his
strength put into it, and every beast has a certain wit in his kind. But as
by his providence he has framed al things, which he has create by a certain
power naturally graffed in them, every thing to work his property, and to
the continuance of his kind, so he has not left the most fa^^e
workmanship of this world without light. For as he is to all folks the
fountain of life, so is he also the fountain of light, by reason that his
father powers into him the fulness of the divine nature, by an everlasting
nativity. So that he only restores life, yea even to the dead, and by his
light puts away the darkness of men's minds be they never so dark. The
light shines in darkness. etc.
Therefore the word of God, which is Christ Jesus, is to men's minds the
self thing* that the yearthly sun is to bodily iyes, whose minds after they
were fallen through sin into most deep darkness and death, he labored to
help with his unspeakable charity. For before that time men did live in
ignorance, and abiding in the darkness of sins, wurshippyng dumme ydoles, instead of the true God, being synfully drowned in blind desires of their minds,
lacked the iyes of the heart, wherewith eternal truth is perceived. God had
sprinkled into men's minds some little spark of a quick perceiving wit, but
bodily affeccions and darkness of sins had blinded the same. And the darkness
of this world was so very great, that neither man's wisdom and philosophy,
neither the religion of Moses law, nor yet the light of the Prophets, could
put it clerly away. But at the last came that our eternal most bright sun,
to whose invincible light all darkness gives place, and he came to restore
life to all men, not only to the Jews but to all nations of the world. And by
putting away the darkness of sins to give sight to all people, that through
the light of faith they might acknowledge God the father only to be wurshipped
and loved, and his only son Jesus Christ. This bodily sun does not give
light to all men at once, for it has his soondrye courses: but this other
spiritual light by his natural power, does shine, yea even in the most
thick darkness of the world, offering it self to all men to thentente
they may have life again, and see the way of eternal salvation, which is
open to every body through the faith of the gospel. And although the world
being blinded with the filthiness of sin, and the cloud of sinful desires,
would not behold this light, yet could it be blemished with no darkness of
this world, how great soever it were. For he only was pure from all
impurenes of sin, neither was he any other thing but light: all manier ways
pure and uncorrupted. For the darkness of this world does continually strive
against the light, wiche the world hates as the bewrayer of his works, and
that darkness does either quench or darken the beams of many, but against
this lively and eternal light it could nothing prevail. The Jews have
striuen against this light, the Philosophers, the great men of the world, and
all those which has dedicate themselfes wholly to transitory things, but
this light has had the victory: it shines still in the mids of the darkness
of the world, and ener shall shine, making all men partakers thereof, so they
will apply themselfes to be apt to receive it. But what should a man do to
them which wittingly and willingly repel the light, when it is offered unto
them, which when they be allured and called to the light, of purpose shut
their iyes because they will not see it? Truly the son of God did leave
nothing undone, whereby any man should lack his light.

For he did not preace himself suddenly into men's sight, lest he should the
more have blinded them by reason of their incredulytie and lack of belief.
For who would have believed a thing so much to be meruayled at, The same came
as a witness.
except little by little, he had prepared men's minds by many ways to belyefe?
Therefore he not being satisfied to have declared to all men by this wunderull
creation of the world, both his almighty power, wisdom, excedyng great
goodness, and excellent charity toward mankind, neither yet contented as it
were to sygnifie his cumming before hand by so many prophecies of the
prophets, and so many shadows and figures of the old law, in conclusion he
sent a man more excellent then all the Prophets, wose name was John, who
although he deserved the chief praise of holiness emonge all men that were
borne until his time, and was called an Aungel for the dignity of his office
being greater then any Prophets office, yet he was none other but man, very
largely endued with many gifts of God. But all those came of Gods
liberality, and not of his own nature, that was given him at the first, yet
he was chosen and sent of God for this purpose, that according to the
prophecy that was prophesied of him before, he might bear witness of that
godly light: which being covered with his manhed, was conuersaunt in the
world, not (as who say) that he which was God, and so declared before by the
voice of the father, should need man's witness: but to the intent he might by
all manier of means cause himself to be had in credit with the people, he
would that John should be the goer before the light: as the day sterre
appearing before, shows the rysyng of the sun to the woorlde. And also that
by his preaching, he should prepare men's minds to receive that light,
which should immediately come after. And because sin is the let whereby the
heavenly light is not admitted and received, John did allure and call all
people to penance, proclaming openly that the kingdom of heaven was at hand:
for the first degree or step to the light is that men should hate their own
darkness. And this John was of so great authority emonge the Jews for the
excellent holiness of his living, that many took him for Christ himself,
whereby Christ would the rather be commended to the Jews by his witness, as
that time required: to thintente that little by little (as men do commonly use)
he might crepe into the minds of the people, for otherwise the meaner person
is always wount to be commended by the witness of the greater: And Esaias had
promised that at Christ's cu^ming, there should a certain excellent light
arise and spring up to them which did live in darkness, and in the shadow
of death: and for that cause before that Christ was notable by his miracles,
many suspected John to have been the light which was promised of the Prophet.
He was not the light.
But John was only the publisher before of the true light, and not the light
it self. Therefore Christ, as the opportunity of that time served, did, as ye
would say, abuse both the error of the Jews, and the authority of John, to
prepare the minds of all men to the faith of the gospel. Truly John was a
certain light, that is to say, a burninge candle, and geuinge light
fervently: burninge in godliness, and giving light by holiness of life,
nevertheless he was nor the light which should bring life to the whole world:
but the word of God, whereof we do speak at this present was that true
light, ever proceeding from God the father, the fountain of all light: from
whence, what soever is lightsome in heaven and earth, boroweth his light: what
spark of wit, what knowlage of truth, what light of faith soever there be,
either among men or Angels, all the same cummeth from this fountain.

As this world is blind without the sun, so all things are dark without
this light. The world also was full of darkness on every side, because sin
and abominable errors did reign in every place. And in the time of this
darkness there did often times shine forth men excellent in holiness of life,
as a little sterre in the most darkest nights, and gave some light as it were
through a cloud, howbeit they did it but to the Jews only or to the borderers
of Iewry, but this true light gives light, not only to one nation, but to all
men that come into the darkness of this world. The Jews went about to
challenge this light severally to themselves, because they thought it to be
promised to them only, for as much (as touching the flesh) it did spring of
them, and emonge them: but that light came to give light to the hertes of all
nations, Which lights every man.
of the whole world, through the faith of the gospel. Neither Scithian, Jew,
Spaniard, Gothian, Englisheman, kings, nor bondmen, be excluded from this
light. The light came to give light to al men as much as lay in it: but if any
continue in their darkness, the fault is not in the light, but in him that
frowardely loves darkness and abhors the light. For the light shines to al
me^, because none might pretend any excuse, when willingly, and wittingly he
perishes through his own fault. As if a man should get a knock at noone
days, because he would not lift up his iyes.

This word of God was always in the world, not (as who say) that he which
is without measure, can be contained in any circuit of place, but he was so
in the world, as the devise of the workman is in his work, and as the ruler
is in that thing he rules. Also at that time this light did shine in the
world, sumwhat opening the godly power, wisdom and goodness thereof, by these
things which were wunderfully creat by it, and by this means it did then,
after a sort, speak to mankind. But many putting their felicity in the
visible things of this world (whom for that cause of good right our lord
Jesus did accustom to call by the name of the world) when he taught them
eternal things, they being blinded with earthly affeccions, did not
acknowleage their maker. The darkness of minds was so great, that the world
knew not the maker thereof, but did wurship serpents, oxen, goats lekes,
oynions, yea and that which is more vile then all these, stocks, and stones,
dispising him, of whom they had received both that themselfes were, and all
that they had.

They being accustomed to darkness, did abhor the light, and being blinded
with sin did enbrace death instead of life: yea and when he did show
himself more familiarly to the world being conuersaunt and living in his
manhed emonges men, he was not known of them which had dedicate themselfes
wholly to this world. Neither is it any meruail though the gentiles being
woorshippers of ydols, and measuring all things by the commodities of this
life, being also ignorant of the prophets, and the law, did not acknowleage
him, whiles he lived here in the shape of a man. This is more to be meruayled
at* that when he came specially to his own people, to whom Messiah had been
promised by so many prophecies of the prophets, to whom he had been shadowed
with so many figures, of whom he had been looked for so many hundredth years
before which saw him do miracles and heard his teaching yet they were so far
from receiving of him, that with fierce minds they went about his
destruction, which came specially to save them. And procured that innocents
death, who freely brought life to his enemies. They saw and did not see, heard
and did not hear, and having intelligence did not understand: which through a
froward study of the law, did rise against him whom the law had promised.
Therefore by their malice it came to pass yt the light which brought eternal
life to the beleuers thereof, was to them occasion of greater blyndnes. But
their frowardnes could not hinder the health of them that believed in it, but
rather the blindness of the Jews made open way for the Gentiles to the light of
the ghospel. They which unto that time were taken for the people of God, which
only did boaste theimselues in the wurshipping of the true God, in the
religion of the law, in the kynred of the fathers, and in the promises of Gods
testament, turned theimselues from the son of god, when he came to them. And
therefore the Jews being righteously cast out as rebels to the gospel, the
grace of the gospel removed thence to the Gentiles: that the course of
things being altered, they which before swelled in pride through the false
color of religion, should openly declare their wickedness rejecting the son
of him, whom they wurshipped for God. And on the other part, they which before
were utterly contrary to true religion and did wurship beasts, and stocks for
their gods, should enbrace the holiness of the gospel by faith: howebeit
upon this occasion the Gentyles were so admitted to be saved by the gospel,
that neither the Jews nor any other nations at all, should be excluded from
having entry thereunto, so they would put away their stubbernes, and show
theymselues obedience to faith, which is the principal and only gate to
eternal salvation.

And albeit many both of the Jews and the Gentiles which loved the world
more then God, withdrewe themselfes from this light, yet the cumming thereof
was not in vain. First of all, it did manifest their infelicitie, which
through their own fault did deprive themselves of so great goodness freely
offered unto them: Neither could any man doubt, but that by the just judge
mente of God they should be reserved to eternal death. Furthermore it caused
that of the contrary part it should more evidently appear, how notable the
liberality of God was to them which with a simple and ready faith would receive
the word of the gospel. And for that cause, he that was both the son of God
and God, did humble himself to our low estate, to thintente yt through faith
he might exalte us to his highness. Therefore he took upon him the rebukefull
misery of our mortality, to make us partakers of his godly glory. Therefore
also he would be borne a corporal man of the virgin, to thintente we should be
borne again spiritual of God: and for that purpose he came down into the earth
to carry us up into heaven. The stately scribes and pharisees, the proud kings
and powers of the world, the stout and hau^ philosophers, were rejected
because they would not believe. But to this high dignity were admitted men of
low degree, of little estimacion, without renoume, unlearned persons, bondemen,
barbarous men, and sinners, whom the world has in no estimacion at all, of
whom nothing is required but pure faith, neither cunninge, nor noblenes of
blood, nor yet the professyon of Moses law: but all that did receive this
word, of what nation or condition so ever they were, of his behalf, he gave
to them this dignity, that they being graffed in Christ through faith and
baptism, and having professed his name, should be made even the children of
God, that they might be made by adopcion the same thing, which Christ was
by nature. And what can be higher then this honor, that they which before
were the children of the devil and inheritours of hell, should through faith
only be made the children of God, the brethren of Jesus Christ, and
coinheritours of the kingdom of heaven? As touching the flesh we were all
borne the children of wrath of our first father Adam, but by the word of God
we be released from that sinful kindred: and touching the spirit, we be
happily borne again of God by Jesus Christ.

For finally God takethe for his children, not such as be borne the children
of Abraham by man's sede, or actual lust in generation, but those that be
borne of God by faith. Our first father Adam had begotten us after an
unfortunate and miserable sort, for he begat us to death and hell. Moreover
they which are borne touching the carnal birthe, be not all borne to one
estate, for some he borne to a kingdom, and some to bondage: But Christ Jesus
the auctor of our new generation does regenerate al men without difference to
like dignity, that the bondage of sin and the misery of mortality put away
through faith and grace, they may be made children of the living God.

Neither is it any meruail though man be transformed after a sort, into the
fellowship of the godly nature, seeing the word of God did submit it self for
this cause to take our flesh, that is to say a mortal body of the virgin,
joining together in himself two things most unlike, God and manne: what
thing is more frail or more vile then man's fleash? and what thing is more
mighty or more excellent then God? Never meruaill that these things were knit
to gither. It was God that did it. Neither mistrust that men may be made the
children of God, seeing he loved us so, that for our sake he himself would be
made the son of man: doubtless he took upon him no fantastical body, for who
could love a vain vision, or a disceitful illusion? but truly he took upon
him the body of a man, that is to say, the full and perfect nature of man,
abhorring not so much as that part, whereby we be subject to death, and do
very litel diffre from the kind of brute beasts. And he bacame not man for a
small time ready by and by to put away that thing, which he had taken: but to
prove assuredly that he took his manhed not deceitfully or under a color, he
was long conuersaunt in earth, he was hungry, thirsty, diverse ways punished,
suffered death, was seen with iyes, heard with ears, and touched with hands.
And to the intent this dignity should always remain with mankind, the godhed,
having the manhed with it, and in it being glorified, sittinge on the right
hand of the father allmighty, does still dwell in us.

Nevertheless he lacked not his godly majesty, when he in his manhed walked
here in earth: for we which lived familiarlye with him, are witness, that he
was both God and man: we have seen him hungry, athirst, slepinge, wepinge,
vexed and dyinge. We have heard him speak with the voice of a man, we have
touched him with our hands, and by all profes, and tokenes we have found him
to be very man: yea and also we have seen his godly glory in very deed mete for
the only son of God, the like whereof was never showed to any of the angels,
Prophets, or Patriarchs, but it was such as God the father would have his
only son to be honored with. And this glory we have seen in the workinge of
his miracles, in the vttringe of his heavenly doctrine, and in the vision upon
the mount Thabor, when he was transfigured before our iyes, when also the very
voice of his father cumming down from heaven, professed him to be his dearly
beloved son, as the said father did notably set him forth in his baptism,
both with his voice and with the holy ghost, under the figure and similitude of
a doo^e. And again when the son before his death desired him to glorify him
with that glory which he had before the world was made, a voice came down
from heaven and knowledged him to be his son, saying: Both I have and will
glorifye the. In conclusion we have seen him in his resurreccion, both when he
already being risen from death to life, did show furthe to us his body,
which we might touch and handle, but yet was it subject to no evil, and
also when before our iyes he was carried up into heaven. And his glory did
appear and shine unto us not only by these things, but also his very death
did aproue his godly power and strength, when as the veil of the temple was
divided, the earth quaked, the stones braste in soundre, the graves and
monumentes did open, the dead bodies did rise again, the sun losinge his
light, brought sudden darkness into the world: And whiles immediately after
a vehementcrie, he yielded up his ghost, as who says he forsook his life
wyllyngly and not for lack of strength. By this so wonderful a death he did
so glorify the father, that both the thief which did hang by him, and also
the Centurion, did acknowledge him to be the son of God. And albeit when he
was conuersaunt here in earth, and went about the business of our salvation, he
had leauer show us exaumple of sobrenes, mekenes and obedience, then to boast
his own greatness, yet all his communicacion, all his deeds, yea his very
behavior and countenance did declare him to be full of all godly gifts,
full of eternal, and such truth as cannot be confounded. For although God
does give to other holy men also large gifts of his grace and truth, yet he
did power into him as into his only son the whole fountain of heavenly
gifts, to the intent that in him alone might be so much as should suffice all
men. And we did thoroughly see him to be such one even until his ascencion.

Let us now proceed and declare how he was first known unto the world, By his
brethren understand his disciples.
whereas until this time not so much as his own brethren believed him to be any
other but man, for he would be known little by little, lest so strange a thing
should not have been believed emonges men, if it had risen suddenly. And truly
many things went before, which might some manner of way have prepared men's
minds to faithful belief: as the authority of the prophets, the shadows
of the law, the agreeable song of the Angels at his nativity, the godly
devotion of the shephardes, the guiding star, the devout behavior of the
three wise men, the unquietness of king Herod with all Jerusalem for the birth
of this new king, the prophecies of Simeon and Anna, and also certain things
that he did, beyond the reche and course of man's nature, whereat his mother and
Joseph meruailed with them self what those things should mean: yet
nevertheless, when the time was come, wherein it was deereed eternally that he
should openly take in hand the busynes of preaching the kingdom of heaven, it
pleased him (as I said before) to be commended and set forth by the witness of
John also for a time: not that he neded man's witness, but because so it was
expedient, either to allure the Jews to believe, of whom every one had John in
hye estimacion, or else to rebuke the unbelief of the wicked, when they would
not believe, no not him bearing witness of Christ, to whom in other things they
did attribute so much, that they took him to be Messiah, which was promised by
the prophecies of the prophets to deliver the people of Israel. Therefore when
John preaching ye kingdom of God to be at hand, had already gathered together
many disciples, did daily baptize many and was had in great authority among al
men (but in very deed men had an ill opinion of Jesus) the said John does openly
beat into the heads of the multitude, and eftsons reherseth that thing which
diverse times before he had witnessed of him: And according to Esaies prophecy
which did tell before hand that he should in wilderness say with a loud voice,
make ready the way of the lord, he now not privily unto his own disciples,
but to all people indifferenly, which every day resorted to him accustomably
because of his baptism and doctrine, yea and came purposely to hear the very
certainty what opinion so notable a man had of Jesus, he, I say, spoke out with
a plain and a clear voice, saying: This is he of whom heretofore I have often
spoken unto you, before whom through error you do prefer me, when that I told
you there should be one which should follow me in age and time of preaching,
and should also be rekened inferior to me in the opinion of the multitude, he
has now overtaken me: and whereas he seemed to be after me, he has begun to
be before me. And no marvel, seeing that even then also he did excel me in
all gifts, although in the judgment of men he seemed inferior unto me.

He is the fountain of all truth and grace. All we whom ye have in so great
admyracion be nothing else but as it were little brooks or forth cumming
streams: for the little that we have every man according to his portion, is
drawn forth out of the fulness of this fountain, from whence, whatsoever
apperteineth to everlasting salvation springs unto all men. All the virtue
that was in the patriarchs, in the prophets, and in Moses, did come from this
fountain. I am nothing else but the goer before of him that is cumming, he is
both the very publisher, and also the auctour of the grace of the gospel,
which gives true and everlasting salvation to all men through faith. We are
bound to thank him for that by the voice of the Prophets we have been
enstructed to godliness: by the prescript and appointmente of the law we have
been forbidden to do eiuill, and for that we have received as it were the
shadow of true religion. Now does even very he offer to all men more
plenteous grace, who through the faith of the gospel, pardons freely all
sins, and gives everlasting life to them that deserved death. For Moses
whose authority is had among you as a thing hallowed or consecrate, is no
manier of way to be compared to him. The law was given by Moses.
Moses was only the pronouncer and setter forth of the law but not the
auctor, and he brought a law ineffectual, sharp, and hard, the which with
figures and shadows might be, as it were a preparacion to the light of the
gospel, that should come after: and thesaied Moses law, should rather make
sins to be known, then take them away: But grace and truth came by Jesus
Christ.
yea and to say truth, should rather make a way to health then give health,
or allure us with promises. But now in stead of the straytnesse of the law,
grace is given by Jesus Christ, which through faith of the gospel, freely and
wholly forgeueth all men their sins. He has given the law of truth in
stead of shadows, whereof he himself is not only the decla^^^, but also the
auctor, as he unto whom God the father has given all power.

And truly these be the secrets of God the father, these be the hid
counsels of the divine mind, by the which it has pleased him that god
should become manne, and after a sort to make men Godlike, to mix most
high things with the lowest, and to exalt the lowest unto the hiest. He did
never fully open these things to any of our forefathers, although he did
sometime shewfurth to them certain little sparks of his light, by Angels, by
dreams, and by visions. For no mortal man (were he never so great) did ever
see God as he is in deed: but covertly as it were in shadow. And although he
did utter in some part to Moses, to the Patriarchs and Prophets a litell
portion of his secrets, yet none but his only begotten son did receive this
fulness of grace and truth: who being made man, did so come down to us, that
nevertheless by his godly nature he does always remain in the bosom of God the
father, and as touching all things that pertayne to the obtaining of
everlasting salvation, he has declared unto us more familiarly and plainly,
without wrappyng, or coueryng the thing which he did signify to the other but
partly, or under a cloud, and as it were in a sleep.

When John had often times privily commended Christ by this manner of witness,
then did he openly declare, what manner of man he was, doing the duty of a pure
honest servant, which neither would wrongfully take upon him the honor of
his master, when the Jews would have given it to him, neither yet would
deprive his said master thereof, although he knew well enough that he
should not only by that means leese the estimacion and authority, which
already he had among the Jews, but also it should cause them to envy him
much, because they had rather have given that authority to John, whose birthe
also was famous and notable emonge the Jews, who for the dignity that his
father was of, being a head priest, was the more highly esteemed of them: who
for the straungenes of his diet, his wearinge of Camel skins, his being in
wilderness, his baptism, and the great number of his disciples, caused ye
people to have him in admiracion, whereas Christ for the baseness of his
kindred, and by reason of his trade of living and apparel, nothing differing
from the common use of people, at that time was litel set by: therefore seeing
that poor Christ himself did not content the proud Pharisees, yea and they
began sum what to envy John, only because he had commended Christ in his
preaching, the said Pharisees sent from Jerusalem priests and levites being
men of great authority, to enquire of John before the multitude who he was,
When the Jews sent priests.
of whom the judgment of the people did somuche vary. For some said that he
was Christ that should deliver the whole nation of the Jews from servitude.
Some supposed him to be Helye, whom according to Malachies prophecy, they
thought was come again to be ye goer before of Messiah to come. As touching
Christ very few regarded him, because both his parents, and himself lived
barely and poorly, yet nevertheless some began to envy him. And so the craft
of the Pharisees did then go about this thing to the intent they might frame
Christ to their evil desires. Which thing they thought should be brought to
pass, if he had not been allowed but by their authority and proof: for if he
had taught things repugnaunte to their affeccions and vices, they would have
disalowed and taken away his authority among the people, whose doctrine they
had perceived should hinder their commodities. This is the folishe policy of
worldely wisdom. But Christ whose doctrine is all heavenly, would not have
any part of their humain authority to be mix with his euangeliall doctrine.
Some of the Jews also did trust it should come to pass, that John although he
were not Christ, yet would accept so honorable a name that was willingly offered
him. They being bondmen most addict and given to glory, did know well enough
that most holy men be soon deceived with this pestilence of vainglorye: they
were not ignorant how much all that nation would have rejoiced, if John
would have taken upon him the name of Messiah* which already a good part of
the Jews did willingly attribute to him. If he had taken it upon him emonge
the people, they had occassion whereby they might exclude Christ, whom they
hated for his poor estate: Who art thou?
if he had taken it upon him they would furthwith have falsely accused him.
Therefore they ask John before the people by the authority they had of ye
Priests and Phariseis, saying* Who art thou? for already they had begun both
to be grieved with his authority, and sumwhat to envy his good renoume. He
being well assured that they asked him these questions for the hatred they had
to Christ, did not byanby open unto them his own opinion as concerning Christ,
but did repel the false suspicion that they had touching himself, which
might have hindered the glory of Christ among the people: and boldly contemning
the glory of an vnrightful title, did confess that he was not Messiah (as many
thought he had been) neither did he deny himself to be that thing he was in
deed, being ready to declare who he was, to whom the glory of that name was
due. Of which two aunswers, the one, that is to say the confessing what he
was himself, endau^gered him to lose his own estimacion: and the other (which
declared him ready to confess Christ) put him in ieopardy to be hated of the
Pharisees. But the manne being perfeicte without corrupcion passing nothing of
either of both these dangers, did openly confess that he was not Messiah,
which was promised by the prophecies of the Prophets, and by the voice of
Moses: not denying Messiah to be alredi come, I am not he^
but I am not he (says he). He showed the^ that this surname was due to an
other that excelled him, who nevertheless was less regarded after their
opinion. And so this maliciouse diligent search of the Pharisees came to none
other effect, but to stablishe the faith of the gospel.

Therefore after they were disapointed in this first question, they did proceed
to demand futher, saying: If thou be not the cheifest of all, and that which
many attribute unto the, seeing thou do usurp a new dignity without the
authority of the Scribes and Pharisees, and causeste the people wonderfully to
favor the, not without ye decay of the common authority of the priests and
Pharisees, at the least thou must be one very nie unto Mesias, and not much
under him. And we read in the prophet Malachie that before Messiah cummeth,
Elias the Thesbite shall cum: who shall repair again all things. Art not thou
therefore that Elias? Art thou Elias?
John denied that he was Elias, not but that he was Elias in sum respect,
because he was the goer before Christ in the spirit of Ely, but that he was
not that Elias the Thesbite which was rapte and suddenly carried up into the
aier in a fiery chariot, whom the Prophet judged to be reserved for this
purpose, that he may be the goer before of the second cumminge of Jesus
Christ. The Jews had read the prophecy, but they understood it not, neither
were they wurthy to learn this mystery, for so much as they enquired it of an
hateful mind, and because they knew that Moses had promised, that a certain
Prophet should come of the Jews kindred. whom he commanded they should give
ear unto. And some of them knew right well that this Prophet should be
Messiah himself, moreover some other brui^ed abroad, that one of the aunciente
Prophets was risen again, and they suspected John to be the same: therefore
they asked him whether he was that Prophet promised of Moses, or at least
some other of the Prophets, which being risen from death to life, should
take upon him that authority. He answered, no.
He did frankely and plainly confess, that he was no such thing as many took
him to be.

But now when they had no more matier to question with him of, seeing men's
conjectures touching John, were at a full point, they moved him er^nestly to
tell openly what he himself was: and because he should no longer make any
delay or excuse, they provoked him by the authority of the priests to
the intent that even for very fear of power, he should confess who he was. We
do perceive (say they) that thou take upon thee more then the Pharisees,
priests, What art thou?
and scribes do. We can no ferther divine or conjecture thereof, and yet we must
bring some answer to them which have sent us hither: I fall the people be
deceived in their so diverse and soundrie opinions of thee, tell thou thyselfe
who thou art: for undoubtedly thou art known to thyselfe well enough. Therefore
whom do thou profess thy self to be? Here now John because he spoke to
them that were learned in the law, lest he should seem to take upon him of
man's presumpcion that thing which he was in deed, he taught them out of the
very prophecy of Esaias, which was right well known to the Pharisees, both
how he was none other but the goer before Christ, I am the voice of a^rier
(...) wilderness, etc.
and that the lord himself was already come, whom they ought to receive with
clean hertes, whom also they being blinded with envy, ambicio^, and pride,
should crucify. I (says he) am neither Messiah, nor Elias, nor any of the
prophets reised up again to this life, neither yet have I taken upon me this
office by mine own authority, forasmuch as many years heretofore, I was
appointed to the busynes of this office, by the authority of God. For I am
even he of whom Esaias did write. The voice of the criar in desert, make right
the way of the Lord. You see the deserte, you hear the voice of the crier:
now there lacks no more, but that you cast away worldely desire, and prepare
your minds against his cumming, that he may come to you a very savior.
Moses did set him forth unto you as it were in a shadow and the Prophets did
long agone prophe^y that he should come: But I do show him unto you now
already cumming.

And you shall understand that they which were sent to John, were of the
Pharisees sect, for the Pharisees in those days did excel all other both in
knowledge of the law, in opinion of holiness, and also in authority. And they
were not fare of from the doctrine of the gospel, forsomuche as they did believe
the immortality of souls, and that there was an other life to cum after this.
But ambicion, couetousenes, and envy, had corrupted their minds. Howbeit at
that time their malice as yet was not so far inflamed, that they would
openly show themselfes adversaries to Christ, but within a while after when
they perceived his doctrine to be contrary to their ren^ume, advantage, and
authority, being utterly cast into an extreme rage, they went about to crucify
their Messiah, whom they had promised to the people by the prophecies, and in
the knowledge of whom they had much bosted themself. So hurtful and pestilent
a thing it is, yea the knowledge even of holy scripture, except a man's mind be
free and void from yearthly desires. But the prudence of God being far wiser
then man's inuencions, can clearly turn the malice of the wicked men to the
wealth of the good. For this so envious and so crafty enquiring of the
Pharisees has stablished our belief.

Therefore they now being more stired and provoked, and not only enuiyng
Christ, whom always they had in contempt, but also John whom heretofore they
had in reverence, go about further to charge him, and find fault with him,
saying: What is the cause, that thou takeste upon thee, the power to baptize
the people if thou be neither Christ, who (as the prophecies do declare) shall
put away the sins of the people, nor Elias the goer before Messiah, nor that
notable Prophet, whom Moses did promise, neither yet any other of all the
Prophets, why then dooeste thou enterprise to put away sins by thine
own authority, which thou neither have of God, nor by any decree of the
Priests, whose authority thou darkeneste with thy new customs? To this
slaundreous demand John did answer mekelye: but yet in such sort, that he
did both freely knowlage his own low estate, and did openly declare the
dignity of Christ. My baptism (says he) is even such like as my preaching
is. I baptize with water. and.c.
For as my preaching is not perfect but only prepares your minds to the
wisdom of the gospel, so my baptism which consists only in the water does
not wash a way the filthynesse of minds, but in a certain resemblaunce of
true baptism, frames the ignoraunte: that they being prepared with
repentance of their former life, may be hable to receive that baptism by
the which Messiah through his spirit shall wash away all at once, the
universal uncleanness and vices of all them that shall credit his heavenly
doctrine. And now he is not far hence, but is already present in this same
great noumbre of people, and as one of the multitude is conuersaunte even in
the midst of you. And he is therefore either despised, or not known of you,
because after the worlds estimacion he is but poor and of small regard,
vaunting himself with no pomp of those things, by the which they that
honor the world do exteeme a man. It has not pleased him as yet to put
forth his power and greatness, but in veraye deed he is an other manner of
person, then you take him to be.

I who in the peoples judgment seem to be sumwhat notable, in comparison of
his highness am nothing at all. This is very he of whom I told you before
that men took him to be mine inferior, and to come after me, but in dignity
he did prevent and excel me, to whose wurthines I am so vnwurthy to be
compared, that I know my self vnwurthy to serve him as a bondsman in the lowest
kind of service, yea to leuse the buckles of his shoes.

John did pronounce this so full and so honorable witness of Christ to the
Phariseis, Priests and Levites, in the presence of a great noumbre of people,
and that in a famous place, that is to say, in Bethabara, which is not far
from Jerusalem beyond Iordane a place very conueniente for him that was a
baptiser and preacher of penance, by reason that plenty of water was nigh to
it, and also the deserte, to which place a great preace of people out of
diverse coasts of Jury, did resort daily to be baptized. For John did both
preach and baptize there.

And hitherto he did so bear witness of Jesus, that he did neither name him,
nor point him with his finger, when he stood among the multitude, because he
would not styre up the envy of the Phariseis against him: And also because he
would set on fire the minds of simple folks the more to have a desire to know
him, whom the said John being so notable a man, had so highly commended in his
preaching, and for as much as at that time many of the people did make
diligent search to know, John sees Jesus cu^ming.
who should be that great man, to whose dignity, even John being in all men's
judgment taken for an excellent person, did so much give place to. Jesus
therefore came thither again the day following, and did not then keep himself
close among the multitude, but went to John severally and alone, partly for
good manier sake to salute his cousin, partly to knowledge his baptiser, but
specially to give him occasion to testifye more plainly and lively of Christ
among the people, lest he being yet not known should seem to go to John for
that purpose, that other did: that is to say, to be baptized or taught, or
else to confess his sins, for in that he was baptized of John, was to give us
exaumple of humility: but because no body should suspecte that he had need of
baptism, or that he had any spot in him, which the water of Iordane could
wash away, he separating himself from the multitude went to John aparte.
John being warned by the holy ghost what he should do, beholding Jesus
cumming toward him, turned himself to the people, and poynted Jesus to them
with his finger: that after they knew him by sight, they should accustom
themselves both to like him and love him the better, and should rather follow
him then John himself, yea and rather covet to be baptized of him then of
John. For the pureness of Jesus mind being full of the holy ghost did shine in
his very iyes and countenance. And did show it self forth both in his going
and all other behauiours of his body: as of the contrary part, a furyouse
mind and overwhelmed with vices, does express it self in the very
countenance of the body. Behold (says John) this is he whom many of you did
see me baptize, whereas in deed the water of Iordane did not purifye him, Behold
the lamb of God which takes away the sines of the world.
but he did rather halowe it. For he alone and none other is free from al kind
and spotte of sin. And verily he is that most pure lamb, whom God
(according to Esaies prophecy) had chosen and appointed to be a sacrifice
most acceptable to him, for to purge the sins of the whole world, which
was defiled with all manner of vices. This is he whom the lamb in Moses law
did signifye, whose vnharmeful blood defended the children of Israel from the
revenging sweord of the Angel. This lamb (I say) is so fer from being subject
to any kind of sin, that he alone is hable to take away all the sins of
the whole world. He is so well beloved of God, that he only may turn his
wrath into mercy: he is also so gentle and so desirous of man's salvation, that
he is ready to suffer pains for the sins of all men, and to take upon him our
evils, because he would bestow upon us his good things.

Yea this is very he of whom I have told you diverse times, though it were
sumwhat derkely, that one should come after me, who going before me in
dignity, and power, did ouerreche me: for because although he seemed to come
after me both in birth of his manhed, in the time of his preaching, and also in
authority, I knew him not.
yet in godly gifts he was far before me. In so much that I myself did not
certainly know at the first how great he was, or what he was. For he is so
great that I (whom ye have in such reverence) am no manner of way to be
compared unto him. He is the lord and auctour of all health. I am none other
but his servant and goer before, neither is my baptism or preaching any
other thing but an introduccio^ to the heavenly doctrine and virtue, which he
shall bring unto you. Neither yet am I sent for any other purpose by the
commandment of God, but to preach repentance of your former sins, to
show you that the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and to wash you with water,
to the intent that after he should be showed to me of his father by sure tokens,
he might at his coming be the better conceived in your minds, being already
prepared with these principles. His conuersacyon and life was simple and pure,
and being in no poyncte notable among men, he joined himself to the multitude
as one of the common sort of the people, and came to be baptized as though he
had been subject to sin.

Therefore I could not know surely by the disposicion of his body, nor by man's
conjecture that he was the only son of God, and that most pure lamb which
through faith should put away all the sins of the world, but that I was
taught by a notable sign from heaven that this was he, to whom I was
appointed to be the goer before. And what this sign was, John did openly
declare to the multitude. When Christ (says he) willing to show to the
world an exaumple of humility, I saw the spirit descend from heaven. etc.
and ioynyng himself to the company of sinners, came to be baptized, the
father of heaven did honor him with an heavenly token. For I my self saw the
holy ghost cummyng down upon his head in the likeness of a dooue and there
remaining. Until that time I did not certainly know him, whose goer before I
was: by reason that his corporal estate, did hyde his celestial excellency.

For as yet the time was not come in the which the father of heaven would
have him to be openly known to the people. Therefore when I knew by the
inspiracion of the said father that Messiah was already come, then to take
away the error and mistakyng of his person, or lest man's conjecture
should have any doubt therein, he, by whose commandment I took upon me the
office baptize you with water, taught me by a sure token: by the showing whereof
I might assuredly know who he was, that should baptize you with an effectual
baptism, and should by the holy ghost, wherewith he was replenished, freely give
to all them that trusted in him, remyssyon of all their sins. For before
Jesus came to me to be baptized, the father of heaven did advertise me before
hand, saying: By this token thou shall surely know my son. Emonges many whom
thou shall wash with water, upon whomsoever thou shall see the holy ghost in
the likeness of a dooue descending, and remaynyng, be well assured, that
the same is he which has power to baptize with the holy ghost. For man washes
with water, but he only by his heavenly power, takes away sins, Upon who^
thou shalt see the spirit descend etc.
and gives righteousness. I saw this token according to the fathers promise
in him when he was baptized. And for this cause, he gave me grace to see him,
that you also through my preaching, should know the autour of your salvation.
Wherefore like as heretofore I have witnessed, so do I now also openly
testify, that this is the son of god, from whence, as from the heavenly
fountayn, ye must require all things which perteyne to righteousness and
eternal felicity. For I will suffer you no longer to suspecte greater things
of me then I deserve, I saw and bare record that this is the son of God.
nor yet to be ignoraunte of him, whom to know is salvation. By these manier
of witnesses, John did often commend Jesus (being as yet unknown) to the
multitude, and gave over his own authority to him as to his better: to the
intent that from that time forth, the people should leave him and cleave to the
governance of Jesus: Gods prouydence in the mean time procuring this, to
thentent that they both might be to us an wholesome exaumple of a true preacher
of the Gospel. For truly John neither with the encisemente of so great
renoume being willingly offered unto him, was so much corrupt that he would
take upon him an other man's praise, nor yet so afraid of the envy of the
Priests and Phariseis, (whose ambicyous envy, and envious ambicyon would
suffer no body to be exalted but themself) that therefore he did cease to
speak of the glory of Christ: neither did he regard his own commodity, but
what was expedient for the people: hereby teaching how a preacher of the
ghospel ought to have a constaunt and sure stayed mind, yea, even to the
auenturyng of his life, not only against excess and covetousness, but also
against al ambicion. And as for Jesus Christ, when he came as one of the common
sort of the people to be baptized, and also when he behaved himself amongst
John's disciples, as if he had been one of them, whereas he was lord of all, he
taught us how we must come to true glory, by great humility and modesty of
mind, and that none is mete to be a master, unless he have played the part
of a good scoller, neither that any ought to take rashely in hand the office
of preaching, except he has been all manier of ways well tried and approved:
and in manier appointed thereunto of God.

Now to thentent that John's most excellent pureness and honesty might more
clearly appear, he thought it not enough to turn thaffeccions of ye people
from him to Christ, but he labors also to despatch from himself his own
peculier disciples whom he had, and to put them to Christ. For the day after
these things, which I have already rehearsed unto you, were done in the
presence of the people, John stood there again, and two of his discyples
with him. And Jesus walked up and down not far from thence (which thing
indede was done to signify a misterye thereby.) For John was a figure of Moses
law, and Christ was the auctour of the profession of the gospel. Therefore
the law, which was now come to the uttermost point, stayed, as though it
could go no further, but should cease byanby, and give place to Christ at
his coming, and commit his disciples to him, but nevertheless in the mean
while constauntly bearing witness of Christ: and as it were delivering the
Sinagogue to the true spouse, to be his church. Christ walks up and down
to declare that he should always grow greater and greater, He beheld Jesus as
he walked. etc.
and every where gathers disciples to hear his heavenly doctrine. Therefore
whiles John stood and beheld Jesus as he walked, knowing right well that the
said Jesus did desire and long for the salvation of mankind, and also did
covet to geat disciples mete for his heavenly doctrine, John turning him to the
twooe disciples which stood by him, being their master, because he would
put them to Jesus, that was a better master then himself, he poynted him to
them with his finger, as he was walking, and said: Behold yonder is the lamb
of God of whom I have so often testyfyed, who alone does take away all the
sins of the wholle world. Behold the lamb of god. etc.
I have prepared you for him, whosoever desires true and effectual baptism,
whosoever loves true innoce^cie, and whosoever coueteth true and perfect
health, must needs commit himself to his rule and order. For they that were the
true obseruers of Moses law, (as the law it self does witness) did profit
and go forward thereby to the perfeccion of the gospel, that is to say,
from faith to faith: whereas the Phariseis through their perverse and overthwart
love of the law, did persecute him who^ the law had commended to the^. Now
John's disciples made their master no answer, but giving credit to his
word, they left the said John that was the goer before the gospel, and
followed Jesus the auctour of the evangelical health. And ye two disciples
heard him.
And they said never a word, but followed him, being set on fire with the
love of his hye doctrine, the hope whereof they had conceived by the testimony
of John. But they dare not be bold to move any communicacion to him with
whom they had not been acquaynted.

Therefore Jesus perceiving for what purpose they did follow him, to declare how
ready he would be to mete and join with them which with pure minds do
thirste and covet the doctrine of the ghospel: he (I say) not tarying for their
calling upon him, of his own good will does encourage and alure their
bashefulnes, and turning himself toward them, did behold them as they
followed him, not yt he was ignorant whom they followed, or of what mind they
followed him, but because he would show to other their worth ye and mete
affeccio^ for the gospel. He speaks to them and asks what they would have,
to the intent that their desire being known, might also kindle and styre up
the minds of other. What seek ye?
But they forth with declared themselves to be very desirous to learn of
him, eue^ by yt very name they called him by, saying: Rabbi, where dwell
thou?
Rabbi (which word in the Siryans tongue is as much to say as Master) wheris
your abiding? And undoubtedly in that they called him Master, they confess
themselves to be his disciples. And whereas they enquire of him, where his
dwelling place is, by that they do declare, that they have a will to learn of
him certain secret things more familiarely, which (peradventure) he would not
speak openly before every body. Here now our lord Jesus taking pleasure in
their devout feruentnesse to learn, makes no excuse by reason of the nynesse
of the night, nor commands them to come again the day following, neither yet
signifies to them where his house is, in case they would at their conuenyente
leisure visit him: But he ientlye and courteously requires them to come talk
with him at his lodgeing, Cum and se
saying: Come ye and se. For he perceived that any delay should have been
paynful to their earneste desire. They rejoicing in that answer, They came.
And abode with him that day.
being even such as they would have wished for, came thither, and did not
only see the little house, where then Jesus had his abidyng, but also tarried
with him all that day: and were so enflamed with his holy communicacion, that
not only they rejoiced in their own behalf, but mocioned and procured other
also to come to the company of that felicity. And when they came to Jesus
house, it was almost the tenth hour of the day, that is to say, nigh upon the
going down of the sun. For there is no time nor place unfit or vnconueniente
for to learn those things which pertayne to everlasting welthe. And the
presence of the preacher of the gospel ought always to be in a readiness:
For such an one ought he to be that takes upon him to teach Christen
philosophy and wisdom, which is only the philosophy that can no skill of
any pride or statelynesse.

As concerning these two, which had followed Jesus by the counsayl of John, the
one of them was Andrew, Simon Peter's elder brother: to which Peter, although
he were the younger, yet for the excellent feruencie of his faith, Jesus
afterward did promise him the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and committed
his sheep to be fed of him, after he had thryse professed his love toward
Jesus. The godly love of the gospel has this difference from that which man
of himself is inclined unto, that if it have gotten any notable treasure, it
hydeth it not, or enuieth other: for many think that they do not possess
that thing, which is common to other as well as to themselves: but this godly
love rejoices that the commodity thereof should be common to many. Andrew
being much comforted with so great felicity, for as much as by the report of
John, but much more by the familiar communicacion of Jesus himself, he found it
true that Jesus was yt heavenly Lamb, which only should take away the sins
of the world, that he was the son of GOD, the only redemer of mankind: and
that also he was Christ which was promised of the Prophets, and looked for
so many hundred years before: the said Andrew (I say) as soon as he had
found Simon Peter his brother, whose presence he desired greatly, for this
purpose, that Peter whom he knew did look for Christ with great feruencie,
We have found Messiah. etc.
might be made partaker of the felicity of that assured knowledge which
Andrewe himself had of Christ: We have found (says he) that Messiah, whom
the Prophets had promised should be redemer of the world. And Messiah in
the Sirians tongue is as much to say as Christ, that is to understand
anointed: because that anointing pertains to kings and priests. But Christ
was the only anointed of God, to him only all power was given both in heaven
and earth, and he only was ye priest eternally after Melchisedechs order,
which has reconciled God to mankind with the sacrifice of his body. Simon
being glad of so pleasant and welcome a message, and not satisfied only to
have heardest, joyfully preaseth himself also to see Jesus. And brought hi^ to
Jesus.
Andrew who had already proved the gentleness and graciousnesse of Jesus,
furthwith brought Simon to him. And when Jesus beheld Peter, he did not only
vewe his face, wherein nevertheless did shine a pureness of heart, but he rather
looked upon his mind which was endued with doouelyke simplicity: and thereby
apt to receive the grace of the gospel. And Jesus beheld him. etc.
The said Jesus taking pleasure in his pure affeccion, does tell the name of
Peter's father (by that declaryng how nothing was hydden from him) and
therewithal prayseth the godly simplicity of Peter's mind, gathering an
argument thereof, by the property of his fathers name: and by the dark sense
of the chaungeing of Peter's own name, he tells before that in time to come,
there shall be in him stablenesse of inuyncible faith. For Jonas is as much to
say, as a dooue or grace. Simon, by interpretacion, signifies obedient, for
out of the obedience of Moses law, is had some furtheraunce to the faith of the
gospel. Therefore after that Jesus had looked upon him, Thou art Simon the
son of Ioanna. etc.
he does like both his present simplicity, and also does sum what open, as
you would say darkely, his steadfastness to come, saying: Thou art that
Simon the son of Ioanna, right aptly agreyng both to thine own name, and thy
fathers: But hereafter when this faith shall have gathered strength, that it
may be able to stand stable and unshaken against al temptacions of the deiuill,
Thou shall be called Cephas. etc.
thou shalt be called Cephas, which in Greek is as much to say as Peter, in
Latin* saxum, and in English a stone. And this was the first instruccion and
principle of Christ's church: this was also the first beginning of the schole
of the gospel.

The day after, it pleased Jesus to go into Galile, whche was least set by of
all the provinces of Iewrie, because no man of any great renoume or fame, had at
any time come from thence: and yet nevertheless Esaias did prophecy before that
the light of the gospel should first appear and have his beginning about ye
place. Also the divine counsayl thought it good so to be, because he would
begin his church of mean persons, untaught and unlearned, borne and come
out of a country that was barayne, and of no regard. For both Peter and
Andrew, which without calling followed Christ, were men of Galile: and that
the one brother did persuade and draw the other to Jesus, was a fortunate
pronosticacion of the church now newly beginning, which consists in
brotherly charity and mutual concord. Therefore when Jesus should go his way
into Galile, having already two disciples of Galile to wait upon him, because
he might come sum what the better accompanied, he takes to him two other also
of the same country, and of like nobility. For Jesus found one called Philip
borne in Bethsaida a city of Galile, which is nigh unto the lake of Genazareth
being the country of Andrew and Simon, He found Philip.
to whom the name of Peter was added. Furthermore in that they were all of one
country, it betokens the concord and agreement of the gospel: And that
the diversities of all manner of people, should be joined and brought together
into one church, as it were into one city. Philip seemed to have met with
Christ by chance, but the very thing in deed was done altogether by the
providence of God, which had eternallye decreed and appointed, whom he would
have to be ye first rulers and beginners of his church. Therefore Jesus said
to Philip when he met with him: follow me. He tarried nothing at all, Follow me
etc.
but byan by followed Jesus* of whom already he had known many things, both by
the witness of John, and also by the common rumor of the people. The word of
the speaker was of so great effect, and the mind of the hearer was ready of his
own good will. It chanced verily, that as Andrew had allured and drawn his
brother Simon, so Philip now rejoicing that he was in the service of Jesus,
Philip found Nathanell.
when he had found Nathanell, whom he knew to be wondrefully desirous of
Messiah cummyng, for which cause he was wont very diligently to mark and
observe in the prophecies of the law and the Prophets, from whence and when
the same Messiah should come, Philip (I say) because he would make Nathanaell
partaker of that joy wherein he did rejoice withal his heart, We have found
him. etc. Jesus ye son of Joseph. etc.
says unto him: We have found that true Messiah of whom Moses has written,
that there should a Prophet rise out of the kindred of Israel, and of whom the
prophecies of the Prophets has uttered and declared so many things: This is
Jesus the son of Joseph of Nazareth, for all that time every man took Jesus to
be Joseph's son, and he was better known by that name then by the name of
Marie his mother. Moreover he was called among the common sort a Nazarean, not
that he was borne there, for Bethleem was hallowed with his birth and infancy,
but because he was conuersaunt and brought up there of a child, with his
parents. When Nathanael heard this, truly he lyketh well the most joyful
tydinges: but he is offended with yt doubt, wherewith he was secretly troubled,
through the prophecy, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?
which (as every man knew) does promise that Christ should come forth out of
Bethleem: therefore he desyring to be taught more certainly, says unto Philip:
Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? of the which town the prophecies of
the Prophets has made no mention? When Philip himself being yet untaught,
and having no ferther knowledge but his plain simple faith, Philip says:
come and see.
could not discuss this hard matier, he advises and allureth Nathanaell to
go to Jesus the fountayn it self, not doubtyng but that he would believe as
soon as he had seen and heard him. If you doubt (says he) to credit me,
come your self and see.

And Jesus who as yet was of no fame or renoume by working any miracles,
sumwhat to open his godly power by the knowlage he had of secret things,
Behold a right Israelite. etc.
when he beheld Nathanael cu^myng toward him, turned to his dysciples, before
Philip gave him any warning of him, and before he named him, and showed
Nathanaell to them, saying: Behold a very Israelite in deed, in whom there is
no guile. In these words Jesus did both praise the true meaning belief of
Nathanael, and also his pure desire to have knowlage, whereas they which
untruly do boast themselves to be Israelites, are wont to be busy and curious
of a desire they have to lay matters to men's charge. Nathanaell perceiving
that Jesus showed by these words, Nathanael says unto him. etc.
how that he knew well enough the communicacion which was between Philip and
him concerning Jesus himself, and meruaylyng how this came to his knowledge,
for as yet he took Jesus to be none other but man, says unto him: how know
thou me? But Jesus yet declaring more evidently how he knew the thoughts of
men, were they never so secret, says: before Philip called the when thou wast
under the figtree, I had already seen the. The co^municacio^ was but between
them two, and there was no witness by, that could make any relacion thereof. The
place was expressed, and the figtree was noted and spoken of by ye way in a
mystery, as a thing privy and of counsel to his first fault (that is to say,
of his unbelief) which fault they must needs leave, that will know Christ.
It was manifest by these arguments that Jesus knew the matter of their whole
communicacyon, whereof nevertheless he makes no great rehearsal, lest he should
seem to up braide him with his lack of faith, which was sham fast, and asked
the question of a good simple mind. As Soon as Nathanaell heard these things,
who was persuaded, that the secrets of the heart was open to god only, and
that the thing which he heard was more than man could do, now being nothing
offended with the doubt concerning the name of the place of Christ's birth,
Rabbi thou art even the very son of God. etc.
he gave his verdit of him, saying: master. Thou art the very son of god,
by whom the father has determined to deliver his people. Thou art that king of
Israel which was long a go promised by the prophecies of the Prophets.

Jesus gladly enbracing the man's so ready and chereful faith, and his so
evangelical profession, does stablishe also the opinion that Nathanaell had
of him. And now more evidently declaring his godly nature, says: Thou have
hereby conceived a belief that I am the very Messiah and king of Israel, which
was promised, because I told thee how I saw thee even then when thou waste
with Philip under the figtree, and therefore thou have a very good opinion of
me: In time to come thou shall see more apparaunte signs, whereby thine
opinion of me may increase. Thou shall se greater things the^ these, etc.
And forth withal Jesus turned him to his other disciples, (of whom as yet,
never a one did judge of him according to his dignity) and he said unto them.
Take this for a surety, hereafter y^ shall see the heavens open and the
angels of God ascendyng and descendyng over the son of man. By this derke
saying, our Lord Jesus did stir up the faith of his disciples, which
although it were simple and uncorrupted, yet was it not fully enstructed,
Uerely, verily, etc. ye, shall se the heavens open.
and beside that far from the perfect knowledge of the excellency of Christ:
He did stir up their faith (I say) to the lookyng for of greater miracles,
and thereby to have higher knowledge. For although the disciples did fantasy,
as it were in a dream, some thing to be in Christ passing man's nature,
whereat they marueiled: nevertheless they did not as yet utterly believe that
the fullness of the Godhead was in him. Nathanaell did confess the selfsame
things which Peter did after confess: But because his meaning was not like
Peter's, he had not therefore like answer that Peter had, which was: Upon
this stone I will build my church. And to thee will I give the keys of the
kingdom of heaven. And in very deed for because some that were very me^, are
called the sons of god in holy scripture, for their great holiness, and other
besides Christ also did many times se before, things which should follow, by
the inspiracyon of the holy ghost: therefore it is not to be marueiled at, if
Christ knew without relacion of any other, what was done secretly between the
two disciples. Furthermore in that he called him king of Israel, intending
thereby to honor Jesus, as it were with an hye and glorious title, it
declares that even as yet he dreamed of a worldelye kingdom. And to have a
kingdom in this world is but a very base and an earthly thing: But it is a
thing of far more honor to be king of all the whole world, and also of
angels. This thing mente Christ when he said that the angels as ministers
diligent to do service, should ascend, and descend over the son of man.
And although the disciples did not yet understand at that time this saying of
Jesus, nevertheless he did hyde it and laid it up in their minds, as a seed
which should bring forth fruicte in due time: For afterward we knew how
the angels did often knowledge him to be king of all things by their
obedient service, as when Gabriel brought tidinges of his concepcion, when they
song at his nativity: Glory be to god that is above: when at diverse times
they appearing to Joseph, did procure the safegarde of the child, when they
did him service after he was tempted of the devil, when they did coumfort him
in his conflict at the time he swe^ water and blood: and whiles they did often
appear in the time of his resurreccion: Again also, when in all men's sight he
was taken up into heaven, the angels were present, as suerties of the promise
of his return. And that in deed shall be done most specially, when he shall come
in the clouds with the majesty of his father, and with the whole host and
company of aunge^s, to judge both quick and dead: and to deliver a kingdom
to god the father.

The.ii Chapter.

ANd Jesus had not tarried long in Galile, but through working of a miracle he
began to declare ye John's witness of him was not untrue. In deed Jesus was
better known in Galile then in other countries of Iewrie, The mother of Jesus
was there etc.
but yet they had no notable opinion of him, when as at ye time also even his
brethren and kinsfolks had no right judgment of him. Therefore the third day
after he came to Galile, there was a solemn marriage made in Cana, which is a
town of ye country. Jesus mother was bidde^ to this wedding, because she was
of alyau^ce to the^. And by this occasion Jesus himself also was bidde^, and
his four disciples with hi^, which he had gathered together a little before. Now
then when ye feast was at the hottest, and the bridgrome for lack of wine was
like to be abashed, as if he had made but a nygardely feast: And besides that
it was to be feared lest his geastes carfulness for lack of wine should
make the feast the less cherefull: They have no wine.
Marie the mother of Jesus of a certain womanly carefulnes desyring to have this
disco^moditie remedied, seeing that already by many tokens and also by the
witnesses of John she was not ignorant of the power of her son, she is bold
to call upon him, saying: Son, they have no wine. In that she dare speak to
him, it declared her motherly authority: And in that she does not prescribe
nor appoynte any thing to him, what she would have done, it shows her
reverence toward her son. But Jesus intendyng now to take in hand the
heavenly business of the gospel, whereof he would have his father to be the
only auctour, suffers not man's authority to be mixte therewith. Jesus says
etc.
For he did not miracles for this purpose to please the affeccions of his
kynsfolkes, but to cause his spiritual doctrine to be the better believed
through corporal signs and tokens, among the unfaithful people of that
country. Therefore he answers his mother sumwhat roughly, not that he did
not love her entierely being such a one as she was, considering he loved all
mankind so much, but to thentent yt he would keep his authority of working
miracles fre from worldly affeccions, and to cause the whole glory thereof to be
ascribed to the power of God. For this was a thing expediente for man's
salvation, which Jesus did greatly thyrst for and covet. Woman what have I to
do with thee?
Therefore not utterly denying his mother, but declaring that she had little to
do with ye business he went about, he answers her: woman what have I to do
with the? I have a time appointed me of my father, when and after what sort I
should weorke the salvation of mankind, that time is not yet come. Hitherto I
have showed my self obedient to thy will, from hens forth I must do all things
according to my fathers will, and not after man's prescript and appoyntmente. In
other things thou have been my mother, herafter I will take thee but as a
woman, as often as I am occupied about my fathers business. Whenever his
glory shall be to be served, I shall not need thy calling upon. I will do of
mine own good will, yt which ye thing it self shall require. I have a time
appointed me of my father. So before yt time also, when he was but a child, he
told his mother of yt she did interrupt him, when he was disputing in ye
temple. And of the like thing again he warned her, when she bad one call him
forth to her, whiles he was preaching among ye people.

But Marie the mother of Jesus, being neither offended with her sons answer,
although it were sumwat roughe, nor in the mean time mystrustyng either his
goodness or his power, makes no answer again, but calls the servants of
the house to her, and secretly in their ears says thus unto the^: Do ye,
Whatsoever he saie^h unto yo^, (...) it.
whatsoever he shall bid you do. Undoubtedly the godly pitiful carefulnes of
his mother, did procure that, lest ye servants lack of belefe, or their
unready service, should be a let whereby that which lacked at the feast should
not be amended. But how and what time ye thing should be dooen, she holding her
peace leaves it secretly to her sons will and appointment. These things were
not done by chance, but Jesus deferred the miracle for ye nonest, because the
lack of wine should be the better perceived of every body, and should be well
seen to be given for necessity, and not for any vain boasting or glory: For
so our Lord wrought all his miracles, that he seemed not to do them for
thaffeccion of any worldly praise, Fill the waterpottes with water
but to succor and relieve men of their eiuilles and griefs: he did them so
temperatly and in so due order, that they could not be don more faithfully nor
with more truth. Therefore now whiles the geastes tarried and were careful for
lack of wine, Jesus perceiving the time to be come that he should be known
to his own, commands the servants to fill with water six pottes of stone,
which stood there for this purpose, that if any, according to ye custom of the
Jews, would cleanse himself with washing, he might have plenty of water ready,
forasmuch as that country was very dry, and in few places well watered with
fountaynes and running rivers. This truly did cause the miracle also to be
rather believed, because ye use of those waterpottes was a solemn thing among
the Jews. And the said pottes never received any other licour but water.
Moreover the greatness of ye vessels setfoorth the belefe of the miracle, for
they contained two or three firkens a piece, so that they could not easily be
removed out of their place. The servants did obey him and filled the
waterpottes with water, as they were commanded even to the brimme. When that
was done, because he would have no witnesses of the miracle, And they filled
them up to ye bri^me.
he commanded them to draw out of the waterpottes and to offer that which
they had drawn, to him that was the chief ruler and had the ordreyng of the
feast. And this Jesus did, partly because the ruler was sober, for he that
has the charge committed to him to see all things well furnished, is ever wont
to abstayn from wine, whiles other folks do drink: And partly because he
being well skilled in taste, and having a fine judgment therein, might more
trewely give verdite of the wine the^ the rest of ye geastes, whose tastes
might seem to be dulled with drynking of much wine before.

But as soon as the ruler of the feast had tasted of the wine, that was turned
out of water, and knew not where they drew it, suspecting the fame to be in
the servants, that contrary to the custom of other, they deferred to bring
in such wine until the latter end of the feast, he calls the bridgrome to
him, desyring to know of him by what occasion ye fault chaunsed. Others (says
he) which make a solemn feast, at the beginning thereof, bring to the table of
the best sorts of wine, afterward when their geastes being already drunk
have their mouths out of taste, and power in drink vntemperatly, the^ they
bring and serve of the wurst sort. But thou contrariwise have reserved unto the
end of ye feast, this wine which is better and more pleasant than any yt was
served yet. And by this o^casio^ ye miracle of ye thing yt was doe^, spread
abrod little by little emonges ma^^. And afterward by examining the servants of
this thing, it was known that the water was not only turned into wine, but
also into very good wine. And as forth waterpottes they had no mistrust, but
that they were only dedicate and ordained for water. The servants put water
to water, and filled them up to the brimme, and after they had drawn of the
same which they powered into the vessels, they offered it to the governor of ye
feast, who was sobre. The bridgrome knows well enough that there was no such
wine provided nor prepared. They went to the waterpots and found them full of
ye selfsame good wine. The beginning of miracles did Jesus. etc.
With this deed our Lord Jesus began the working and setting forth of his
miracles in Cana a town of Galile, intending by little and little to show forth
tokens of his godly power to the world. For first of all this thing was done
in a matier not very weighty and also privately, yea and almost to please his
mother and kinsfolks withal: which had him in less admiracion because they
were his familiars and of his kin. And this miracle was not much noted of
very many, but afterward it grew to be had in greatter credit with more:
yet in the mean while ye faith of his disciples yt were present was stablished
concerning Jesus, who having promised greater things, performed that which he
had promised. And besides that, this miracle (whereby he framed as it were a
beginning to ye rest that he should do afterward) was not in vain. For first
of all he would honor the marriage with his presence, knowing beforehand that
in time to come there should be some which would condemn it as an vnpure and
filthye thing, whereas an honorable marriage and undefiled bed, is a thing most
acceptable to God. Moreover Jesus did as it were shadow unto us by a certain
figure, that thing, which he then chiefly went about. For now was the time
come yt in stead of the unsavory and waterishe lettre of Moses law, we should
drink the pleasant wine of the spirit of the gospel, by reason that Christ
turned into our more wealth that thing which was without strength and
unprofitable. For the law was not only unsavory to ye Jews without Christ, but
also hurtful and deadly. They which have not believed in the ghospel, do still
drink of the water of Moses law, but they, which have believed Christ do
happily wax warm, and grow lively toward the love of heavenly life, through
the moist and sweet licour of his heavenly doctrine. And this was not done
before that Christ had joined unto him the church his spouse. Also the mother
of Jesus was present there, representing the form of the sinagogue, whose
authority is diminished, yet she tells the lack of the wine, but she her
self does not remedy it. Nevertheless she was for our behoufe mother unto him,
which does rejoice and coumforte our minds with the sweet wine of his spirit.
The names of the places also do agree to the mystery of ye thing. For Cana of
Galile betokens possession of a ready passage from one place to an other. For
now was ye original beginning of a new people gathered together, which should
remove from the letter of the law, to the spirit of the gospel, from the
world, to heaven.

After Jesus by this miracle had begone to declare his mighty power emonges
his kinsfolks in a town of small renoume, he went down to Capernaum. That
city is in the selfsame Galile of the Gentiles, all ryottouse and swelling in
pride, by reason of the plenty of richesse therein: being also nigh unto the
lake of Genazareth and in the coasts of zabulon and Neptalim. But according to
the wisdom of the ghospel, that thing which is highely esteemed in the world,
is abject, and little set by before God. Jesus mother with his brethren and
disciples went down thither with him, but they tarried there very few days.
Neither was there any miracle done in that place. But this benefit seemed to be
done in the mean time, for his mothers and kinsfolks pleasure: who^ now he
would no longer carry about with him, for as much as he would take in hand
greater things, because that worldly affeccion and love should challenge unto
it no part of those things which were done for the glory of the heavenly
father.

Therefore Jesus leauyng his kynsfolkes behind at Capernaum, seeks time and
place mete to declare openly his power and authority, which he had received of
his heavenly father, and not of men. For even then the most high and solemn
feast of the Jews was at hand, which is called Easter, and after the Hebrewe
tongue, is as much to say as a passing over. They did keep this day as an holy
feast every year in the remembrance of the old story: because their elders
had safelye passed over out of Egipte: when they went into the land which
God had promised them. But now that thing which they did honor but in figure,
was done in deed by Christ, yt is to say, he now brought to pass that men
having forsaken the darkness of errors, and cloud of sin, should be
removed, and brought, through the faith of the gospel^, ^o innocence, light
and immortality: forasmuch therefore as at that time there was at Jerusalem a
great number of people which out of all the parts of Sirya did assemble there
against that feastful day, Jesus went thither now going up toward his
fathers business, Jesus went up to Jerusalem* etc.
whereas before he went down to Capernau^ to obey and please his kinsfolks
withal. And furthwith he goes into the temple, which place is wont to be often
gone to of a religiouse mind, to serve god therein: And verelye Christ was the
master of true religion, who when he entered into the temple which was
ordained for devout religion and wurshipping of god, found there thapparaunce
not of a temple, but rather of a market place. For he found very many there
which in yt holy place did exercise themselves about filthy, And found those
that sold oxen.
yea and sinful gain, and so turned into robbery that which was ordained to
give occasion of godly religion. For to thinte^t that straungiers might have
somewhat to offer, they sold to them of an hye price, sheep, oxen dooues, and
other such like things, which (according to the custom of ye Jews) were
woonte to be offered or given to the priests: but in the mean while ye
sellers bargained with the priests and levites that the said priests and
levites should sell again to the^ by a less price, the selfsame beasts that
the priests had received of them which had offered, which thing the sellers
did, because they might sell those beasts again to other straungiers with a
double gain. So it was brought to pass that by powling the strangers, the
filthy gain which rose double by selling one thing twyse, should be divided
between the merchauntes and the ministers of the temple. And to have more
quick and ready marchaundise, there was present, according to the custom of
their common market, chaungers of money and bankers, such as did change the
greater coins for money of smaller coin, or gold for silver, or else did
exchange strange coin for coin of that place. And thereby also they had
shameful gain, little dyfferyng from usury. Jesus then declaryng by his very
act how great a pestilence corrupt desire of lucre is to the church, and how
far al they ought to be from this disease, which profess themselves rulers of
religyon of the gospel, made him (as it were) a scourge of small cords, as
though he would drive dogs out of gods temple. And both with great
indignacion and authority, he drove them all out of the temple, displacyng and
throwyng down both the merchauntes and their wares: And did not only put out
the men, but also the sheep, and oxen, that there should remain behind no
such filthy baggage.

Yea and besides that, he scattered abroad the chaungers money upon the ground,
and overthrew also their boardes, teaching how these things ought utterly to
be trodden under foot of the wurshippers of true religion. Moreover as if he
had been moved with indignacion thereat, he said to them which sold the dooues:
have these things hence: and make not my fathers house an house of
marchaundise. And his disciples when they saw Jesus, being at all other times
quiet and meke, here now how earnestly he chased out those which did unseemly
use and defyle the godly religion of the temple with their foul and sinful
gain, the disciples, I say, remembered the prophecy which is in the three
score and eight psalm. The zele of thy house has even eaten me.

But as for the Jews when they had heard that he namyng his fathers house,
did as it were by a certain peculier and singular way, declare himself to be
the son of god, and saw him also so hyely take upon him openly and in
apparaunce to be so very angrye with them, which seemed to further both the
priests profit, and also the religiouse service of god, they cry out upon
him and say: If god be thy father, and if thou will revenge the contempt and
injury of thy father, do so^e miracle yt we may perceive thou do these
things by the authority of thy father. If thou do these things by thine
own authority it is presumpcion: And if thou do them by gods authority,
what token she west thou that we may believe thee? But Jesus knowing yt they
would slander him in case he had wrought any miracle to show himself thereby,
seeing he never yet did any miracle but only to succoure them that lacked
help in their need, to thintente yt the same thing which was a proof of his
godly power, should be also a benefit and help unto the necessity of man, he
promised the^ a toke^ under a parable, which toke^ if he had the^ openly
declared, they would not have believed, in so much as they did not believe it
when it was doe^ in deed. The toke^ was concerning his death and resurrection.
The same was also signified by Jonas, which toke^ Jesus had promised after he
had done many miracles, and also at such time as they required him to show su^
toke^ yt should cu^ from heaven. But now he promises (although more darkely)
yt selfsame token to the^, who as yet were but ignorau^^: The temple wherein
they were at that time, occasioned him to say as he did: of the which temple y^
Jews did boast themselves beyond measure. Destroy this temple, and in three
days. etc
Break down this temple, says he, and in three days I will set it up again.
This parable not so much as his Apostles did understand. But at length when
they had known and seen his resurrection, they perceived the meaning of his
saying, by theffect of the thing it self: For Jesus meant it by the temple of
his own body, which they through their malice should pull down, by putting it
to death: and he by his godly power, should raise it up again within three
days. The Jews thought this saying not only to fond and without reason, but
also ungodly and wi^ked. For it was an ungodly thing to command a temple of so
great religion to be broken: and to set up again within three days so
laboriouse a building, seemed to be a saying contrary to all reason.

And as they understood the thing, so they answered accordingly, saying: Men
labored very sore ye space of.xlvi. years after that the Babilonia^s had
brought Iewry into captivity to repair this temple, and will thou set it up
again in three days? Our lord Jesus made no answer to that obieccion, knowing
that he should have done no good, in case he had made plain his dark saying,
when not so much as his own disciples, yea, after they were instructed by his
doing of so many miracles, and his so manifold preachinges, could abide to
hear his death spoken of, nor believe the mystery of his resurreccion. Yet this
saying did cleue and remain still, as a certain seed in the minds of the
hearers: but it brought forth sundry fruits in soondry persons. For the Jews
keeping the same still in their remembrance, did lay this saying to his charge
before the wicked priests, as a cryine worthy of death. The disciples in as
much as at that time they could not understand it, yet bearing it in their
minds, did meruayl what it should mean until the time that after his
resurreccion the holy ghost taught them how Christ by the name of the temple,
But he spoke of the temple of his body.
meant his own body that was much more holy then the temple, which the Jews
did honor so religiously: for so much as the fullness of the godheade did
dwell therein. And yet emongeste them it was sacrilege to defile and violate
that temple of stone: but they were nothing afraid synfully to throw down the
most holy temple of his most holy and precious body. Howbeit Jesus the very
Solomon who had builded this temple for his own self, of the virgin Marie,
did restore it again within three days after they had pulled it down,
according to the prophecies of the prophets. Therefore the disciples conferring
the scryptures with Jesus saying at this time, And they believed the scripture.
etc.
did perceive this his resurreccion to be the greatest token whereby he declared
to the Jews his godhed. For albeit we have red that some men have risen again
from death to life, yet no man did raise up himself to life but only our lord
Jesus. For he only had power in himself to leave his life and to revive it
again, when he would. And so by these principles and beginninges, Jesus did
sti^re up all the Jews minds to look for greater things in him against their
hye feast, which was now at hand.

But after yt he had tarried at Jerusalem certain days of the feast of Ester,
and by his miracles and doctrine had, as it were, sown some seeds of the
faith of the ghospel, many being moved rather with the miracles which he did
the^ with his words, did credit his saying: and believed him to be the son
of god, whom he preached himself to be. For the Jews be not so much moved
with reason as with the sight of miracles: but Jesus then showing to us the
very form and fashion of a teacher of the gospel, to whose wisdom it
apperteyneth not even at the first to commit to the minds of ignoraunte
persons all the mysteries of his hye doctrine, whose ge^tlenesse it behooves
to bear with, and to suffer them that be yet but weak and imperfect until
they may attain to hier things: Jesus, I say, because he knew their faith
was yet but wavering and imperfect, and their minds not hable to receive the
mysteryes of the wisdom of the gospel, he did not adventure himself among the
common sort, lest the peoples affeccions should be suddenly altered, where by
some commocion were like to rise. For there were many that were sore vexed with
this authority of Jesus, specially they which did suppose that his doctrine
and glory should hinder their lucre and authority. The envy of the Phariseis
and Scribes had not yet brast forth into open slaundering of him, but
nevertheless they kept envy and malice close in their hearts, deceitfullye
sekyng occasion to hurt him. And therefore because at this time Jesus could
do little good among them, lest he should give evil persons occasyon of
greater evil, he withdrewe himself from them, forasmuch as he knew the secret
thoughts of them all, neither neded he to be told any thing of any manne.
For he, who was ignoraunte in nothing, knew even of himself the very
secrecy of every man there. Neither yet in the mean while did Jesus make any
prouisyon to save himself, who willyngly came of veraye purpose to suffer
death for the salvation of the world, but he took away from their malice
occasyon whereby they should else have sinned.

The.iii. Chapter.

Amongst many which had conceived some good opinion of Jesus by seeing him do
his miracles, there was a certain man called Nicodemus, who was of ye phariseis
sect: and one of the noumber of them which were taken among the Jews for
chief rulers. This Nicodemus knowing right well that there were many of his
order and sect, which did envy Jesus, and lay in wait to do him displeasure,
went unto Jesus, but it was in the night time: declaring by that deed how he was
as yet but weak and wavering in his love toward Jesus: whom although
heretofore he had in great admiracion, The same came to Jesus by night etc.
nevertheless he would not for his sake sustain any loss of his own renoume
and glory among men: nor yet for his love would he be brought to be hated and
envied of his own cumpany: but this came rather of fear then of ungodliness,
and surely more of worldly shamefastnes, then of frowardness: and of truth
this manner of shamefastnes has so great power in some folks minds, that they
which can little regard both their goods and their life, cannot overcome
this kind of affeccion, which is specially graffed in those hertes that be
naturally disposed to gentleness. For he which was the chiefest among the rulers
of the Jews, was ashamed to be taken for poor Jesus disciple. And he who was
placed in ye hiest seat of the Synagogue, feared to be put out of that place.
But Jesus the most mild and gentle teacher, who does not break the broused
reed, nor quench the smokyng flax, did not repel or refuse the said
Nicodemus, that came to salute him, though he were both fearful and came out
of due time, but does courteously receive him who was doubtless a weak
spirited manne, but yet without malice, and for that cause worthy to be
promoted little by little, to higher things. Now byanby Nicodemus declaring how
much he had profited by seeing Jesus do his miracles, makes suite to get his
good will with this preface. Master, says he, we do already evidently
perceive this thy doctrine not to be such as the Phari^eis is, for the thing
it self does show that thine authority of preaching is given the not of man
but of God. For no man could do these miracles, which thou do except God
were present with him and did help him. Nicodemus did set forth this opinion
concerning Jesus, as an hye and great estimacion, howbeit it was far under
his dignity: for Nicodemus supposed him to be none other, but sum Prophet
whom God did favor, and was present with in the doing of his miracles, as
though he had not wrought them by his own power.

But Jesus does neither reprove Nicodemus imperfect opinion concerning him,
neither does he forthwith boast of his own greatness: but with gentle and
fre^dly behavior, little by little brings him that is so apt, and easy to be
taught, unto further knowledge of more secret mysteries of the eua^gelicall
doctrine. The Jews which had as yet dru^ke but only of ye water of Moses law,
which had known nothing else but the baptism of John, neither had they yet
tasted the wine of the evangelical doctrine, nor had been baptized by the
spirit and fire: The Jews (I say) understood all things carnally, and for
that cause were very rude and unfit for the Philosophy of the gospel, which
^s all spiritual. Therefore our lord did not cast him in the teeth with his
ignorance, nor with his halting mind on both sides, in that he did partly
apply himself to the world, and partly to God, nor yet spoke that thing to
him which afterward he required of his disciples, when they were come to more
knowledge, saying to them: whosoever shall be ashamed of me before men, I will be
also ashamed of him before my father. Our lord, I say, did lay none of these
forsaied things to his charge, but by his dark sayings he causes Nicodemus
to utter his ignorance, to the intent that little by little he may instruct him,
and bring him from carnal affeccion to spiritual understanding. Nicodemus
(says he) take this for a very suertie, Jesus answered. etc.
except a man be borne again new, and as it were changed into a new man, he
cannot see the kingdom of God: So very new is this doctrine which thou
desire to learn of me. Forasmuch as Nicodemus thought that saying to be to
no purpose, he answers in deed ignorauntly and grossly, but nevertheless
simply and plainly, saying: how is it possible that a man being already of so
many years as I am, can be borne again? Can it any way be brought to pass
that he should enter into his mothers womb, and come thence again and so be
borne a new?

Jesus being not offended even with this so gross an answer, vouchesaueth
ge^telly to enterprete and declare what it is to be borne a new, or from above.
Nicodemus (says he) the thing that I have said to the is most true. He that
has a will and desire to be hable to receive the euangelical doctrine, must be
borne again: Except a man be borne of water and of the spirit.
but the manner of birth that I speak of, is after an other sort: for it is
not carnal but spiritual, and it does not consist in multiplying of bodies
by generation, but in turnyng of sowles into a new form: neither by this birth
be we made again the children of me^, but ye children of God. Therefore be well
assured (as I toulde you eue^ now) that except a man be borne again by water
and the holy ghost, That which is borne of flesh. etc.
and of a carnal man become spiritual, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God which is altogether spiritual. Like is borne of the like. That which is
borne of the flesh, is none other thing the^ flesh: but that which is borne of
the spirit is spirit. And verily as much difference as is between the flesh,
and the spirit, between ye body and God, so much is this generacio^ (whereof I
speak) more excellent then that which brings forth one body out of an other.
They which be borne after ye flesh, do sauer none other thing but the flesh,
nor believe any thing to be, but yt which they feel and perceive with their
senses. But those things which be not seen, be most excellent, and of
greatest strength, where as the flesh is weak and impotente.

Wherefore seying that there be two sundry ways how to be borne: there is no
cause why thou should marvel that the same very man, Marvel not thou
that I said to thee, ye must be borne from above.
which is once borne naturally after the flesh, whereby he might be the child of
a man, should be borne again of the spirit invisible, that thereby he may be
the child of God, who is a spirit, and also might be made apt for the
kingdom of heaven which is spiritual and not carnal. But if thou do not
yet understand me, take unto the a similitude of such things as be sumwhat
agreeable to spiritual things, The wind blows. etc
and yet may be perceived with our bodily senses. God in very d^de is a most
sincere and pure spirit, and very far of, from all bodily senses: but this
air, whereby we be co^serued in life, and whereof we feel so great strength and
profit, is called a spirit or wind, because in comparison of our bodies it is
right subtle and fine: but this kind of spirit the wind, is not stayed at
man's will and pleasure, but of his own violence is carried whyther soever he
list: spreading it self over all things, and putting into corporal things a
marvelous force and strength. Sumtyme it brings life, sumtime death: it is
otherwhyle calm and still, and otherwhile more boysteous and violent: sumtyme
it blows out of the East, sumtime out of ye West, sumtime out of one part of
the world, sumtime out of another, showing himself by theffect thereof: and so
thou hear the sound of it when thou see no body at all, nor any thing
which thou can catch or lay hand upon: thou perceyuest that it is present,
yet do thou not see it when it cummeth, nor to what place it conueyeth it
self when it goes from thee. So is every one that is borne of the spirit.
This spiritual birth is of like sort. The spirit of God does rauishe and
transform the minds of men by secret inspiracio^s: Therefore there is felt an
vneffable strength and efficacy, and yet the thing which is done is not
perceived with our iyes. And they which be thus borne again, be not now led
with a worldly and carnal spirit, but with the spirit of God, which gives
life to all things and governs the same.

Nicodemus being as yet rude and gross, did not repugne against Jesus, but not
perceiving the meaning of his words, and desirouse also to have those
things, which he had heard, more plainly declared, says to Jesus: By what
means can these things be brought to pass that a man of bodily substance
should be turned into a spirit by a new birth, How can these things be?
and of God be borne godlyke? Now Jesus to declare that those things which
pertain to the heavenly doctrine are not perceived with man's reason, but
rather are comprehended with faith, and showing likewise that the philosophiers
of the world being proud of their natural wit, were unapt to be taught
these things, yea and the Phariseis also which stoutly professed the
litterall sense of the law, Art thou a master in Israel? etc.
when in deed they knew not the spiritual meaning thereof: but to declare
therefore that this his doctrine is the same wisdom which the father of heaven
would hyde from worldly persons, and open to them which as touching the world,
are simple witted, and taken for fools: Jesus (I say) makes this answer to
Nicodemus saying: thou art taken for a master in Israel, and professest thy
self to be a teacher of the people, and art thou ignorant in these things
which thou ought most chiefly to know? how far of then are the common
sort of people from spiritual doctrine, if thou being so great a teacher of
the people, do not understand these things? but in the mean while it shall
profit thee to believe that thing which thou can not understand. Faith shall
cause the to feel and perceive these things although thou see the^ not: for
if thy wit cannot serve thee, to come to the full knowledge of the nature and
violence of this worldly air, when thou felest it with thy senses, how shall
thou attain to the knowledge of these things which are far hier and further
of from al bodily senses? For truly in as much as they be godly, they do far
pass and surmounte the capacity of men's minds, except their minds be
inspired with the holy ghost.

But thou may surely and safely believe me which do not only by
inspiracion feel these things that be heavenly, or have only heard them after
such sort as the Prophets did (of whose number thou take me to be one) but
we speak things whereof we have full proof and sure knowledge, We speak as
we do know. etc.
yea and we bear witness to you in earth of ye thing which we have seen in
heaven. But ye which be not yet borne again by the spirit, do not believe
these spiritual things. Ye believe a man when he hears witness of those
things which he has seen with his bodily iyes, and yet ye do not credit him,
who being heavenly himself, has seen heavenly things with his spiritual
iyes. As heavenly things be of more certainty then earthly things: so they
be more assuredly perceived of him which has heavenly iyes. Uerily our Lord
Jesus spoke these things covertly and darkely, signifying that he was
naturally God, although he carried about a mortal body: and to show also that
this witness which Nicodemus did attribute to him as an hye thing (that is to
say that he was sent from God) was far under Jesus dignity, after his sort
of meaning which he spoke it: for Nicodemus as yet judged no higher thing of
Jesus, but that he was sent from God as we read other Prophets have been, and
in such wise as John also was sent from God. But the son of God was after an
higher sort sent from God, who alwaie had been with God the father, before he
was sent: yea and eue^ then was with the father as touching his godhead: by
reason whereof, he never departed from the father. And for because those things
which hertofore Jesus had spoken concerning how to be borne a new by water and
spirit, might appear to gross or rude for the highness of this mystery, that
is to say how Gods nature and man's should be united together in one person,
that the same person should live in earth a very mortal man, and be so
immortal God still remaynyng with his father in heaven: Therefore (I say) Jesus
spoke further, saying: If you, by reason of your carnal and fleshly mind, do
not believe me speaking to you as yet but of earthly things, how will ye believe
me, if I shall tell you those things that be altogether heavenly? which
nevertheless both I my self have seen, and known more assuredly then ye know
these things which ye see with your bodily iyes.

For who among either men or angels was ever able to ascend up to heaven,
there to behold celestial things, and presently to look upon the divine
nature as it is in deed? No man asce^deth up to heaven.
No man at al ascends up into this heaven, but the son of man, who came
down from heaven into the earth: and the very same does yet still remain in
heaven, being never separate from the perfect beholding of the godhead, albeit
in the mean while he seems here in earth, to be base and little regarded. But
thus it was thought mete to ye determinacio^ of God, to declare his glory to ye
world by worldly reproach, and low estate: to the intent yt by the very same
way, men after they have forsaken false glory: should make haste to the true
and eternal glory. And if any manne ask what necessity compelled the son
of God to come down from heaven, and to live here in earth as a poor abiecte
person: truly none other thing was cause thereof, but the most hye and
excellent love of God the father toward mankind, for whose salvation he has
given his only begotten son to suffer death, yea and such a death as is
most shameful after the worlds estimacio^, his will was to bestow and give
one for the salvation of al men. As Moses lyfted up ye serpent.
Nicodemus (says he) let not this thing seem to thee to be suddayne and
strange, this is the very thing which Moses by a figure did signify should
come, when, at such time as the people did perish through the vehement invasion
of serpents, he did hang up a brazen serpent upon a stake: that whosoever had
looked thereupon, should be safe from the deadly biting of the serpe^tes.
Therefore as that brazen serpent having in deed the likeness of a venomous
beast, but yet being so void of all venom, that it did also help others
which were poisoned, was hanged up in the desert, that all men might see it,
for their safety: so must the son of man be exalted, to th^ntent that all,
which through faith shall lift up their iyes unto him, may be delivered from
the deadly poison of sin, that not only the people of Israel, but generally
what manne so ever with a pure heart puts his full trust in him, should not
perish, as subject to sin which brings everlasting death: but through the
death of one innocent, should obtain eternal life. Truly our lord Jesus by
this manner of dark sayings opened to Nicodemus the mystery of his manhed,
and of redemyng the world by the cross: albeit he was not yet able to receive
and understand these things. In the mean while declaryng therewithal, how
great difference was between them which did read the law after a carnal
sense considering nothing but the plain story thereof, and them, which by
inspiracion of the holy ghost (of whom heretofore we have spoken) did
perceive the mistical sense that l^eth hid, covered over with the text. But
nevertheless our lord Jesus did then, as it were, sow seeds of faith into
Nicodemus mind: that hereafter he might perceive this thing to have been done
not by casualtie or chance, but by the appointment of God: and so the good
seed being received into apt ground, might bring forth in due time, the
fruit of faith, not only in Nicodemus heart, which did hear these things,
but also in all their minds, unto whom these things should be declared by his
report.

For who would have believed the charity of God to have been so great toward
the world being rebel to him, He gave his one* ye begotten son.
and guilty of so many great faults, that not only he did not revenge the
ungracious acts that had been committed therein, but also sent down his only
son from heaven into earth, and delivered him to suffer death: yea even the
most shameful death of the cross, to thintente that what man soever would
believe in him, were he Jew, Grecian, or never so barbarouse, should not
perish, but obtain eternal life, through the faith of the ghospel. For
albeit that in time to come the father should judge the universal world by
his son at his last cummyng, yet at this time, which is appointed for
mercy, God has not sent his son to condemn the world for the wicked
deeds thereof, but by his death to give free salvation to the world through
faith. He that believes on him is not condemned
And lest any body perishyng wilfully, should have whereby to excuse their own
malice, there is given to al folks an easy entry to salvation. For
satisfaccion of the faults committed before, is not required: neither yet
obseruacion of the law, nor circumcision: only he that believes in him shall
not be condemned: Because he has not believed.
forasmuch as he has embraced that thing, by the which eternal salvation is
given to all folks, be they never so much burdened with sins, so that
the same person after he has professed the gospel, do abstain from the
evil deeds of his former life, and labor to go forward, to perfect godliness
according to the doctrine of him, whose name he has professed: but whosoever
contemnyng so great charity of God toward him, and putting from himself the
salvation that was freely offered him, does not believe the gospel: he has no
need to be judged of any body, forasmuch as he does openly condemn himself,
and reiectyng the thing, whereby he might attain eternal life, makes
himself giltye of eternal pain. God has offered salvation to all folks by
his only begotten son, and yt through faith, to thyntent we may knowledge
and wurshyp him as the auctour of salvation, and put the hope of all our
felicity in him. Whosoever refuses thus to do and despises the goodness of
god being so ready to be had, and dishonoreth his son, whom the father
would have to be honored, and also estemeth as nothing his death that he
suffered for us, that person (I say) does declare himself even in very deed
to be worthy of everlasting punishment. For who perceyueth not him to perish
of good right, and through his own fault, which willingly and wittyngly does
embrace that thing, by the which he perishes, and resists that thing, whereby
he might have recovered health?

Error and sins be the darkness of minds, and sins do engender
everlasting death. The son of God is the light of the world: for the light
is truth, Men loved darkness more then light.
to believe him is everlasting health. Therefore when through the bountiful
goodness of God, light came into the world, which was blinded through lack of
knowledge of the truth, and with innumerable vices, to the intent that the
truth being known, it should be converted and saved: yet men loved their own
darkness, more then the light that was sent from heaven. If the sick man
perish, which hides his disease from the phisician, because he would not be
helped, does not he give judgment of himself that he perishes through his
own fault? So men that were altogether given to the world, did refuse the
light when it was offered them* because their works were evil. For as he
which commits a shameful act, does love the dark night* Because their
works were evil.
and shunneth the light of the sun, lest his deeds should be known, so
they which know themselves guilty, hate the light of the euangelical truth,
by the which all foul and naughty doings are bewrayed, because they might
be amended: for he cannot be helped that loves his disease. The sinner must
m^slyke himself, that he may please God. But he whose works be good, loves
the light of the sun, that he may be commended for his well doing. So he
that has a good conscience, or at least he which desires to be healed, and
does not dissemble or color his sins: For every man y^ evil does hates
the light.
(for this is also a kind of truth to knowledge the evil that is in thee, and
to covet the good thing which thou lackest) he, I say, does willyngly offer
himself to the light of the gospel, that his works may be made manifest:
and those deeds which be good may be praised, because they proceed not from
the spirit of the world, but from God: and those which be evil may be
corrected and amended. But they which do presumpteously attribute to
themselves perfect righteousness by the obseruacion of the law, when inwardly
their minds swim in vices, they also which set their felicity in the
defenses of worldly wisdom, and in the commodities of this world, either
they live in great darkness in case they believe this in their heart, or else
they live in greatter darkness, if they being blinded with their naughty
affeccions, do stiffly uphold and maintain that thing, which they perceive to
be evil; and obstinately refuse that thing which they see to be helthfull. Our
lord Jesus did (as it were) lay up in store certain seeds of such like
mysteries, in Nicodemus heart. And verily this is that Nicodemus, which
afterward did defend and answer for Jesus, against the false surmises of the
Phariseis by mean of his authority, saying, how no man ought to be
condemned, but upon due prose of his acts. This is he also which did honor
his burial with his service, when he was dead.

Jesus then, after he had laid these foundacions of the glory of the ghospel
in Galile, He tarried with them and baptized, and John also baptized, etc.
and Jerusalem, to the intent he might more and more be known abroad, went into
the land of Iewry, which country had his proper name of Judas the author of
that tribe, of the which Jesus lineally descended. And there he tarried a little
while with his disciples, beginning his evangelical preaching with the same
principles wherewith John had begun. For he did allure them to penance, and did
baptize them. And at that time also John did still baptize, for Herod had not
yet put him in prison. But now he did not baptize in Jordan as he was wounte to
do, but in a place less notable, which was called Enon, There was much
water. etc.
not far from Salim, (which signifies in the Syrians tongue, guishyng
streams of water) by the reason whereof, there was ple^tie of water to baptize
the people withal. Many did come to that place, and were baptized of John: Sum
went to Jesus, and were baptized of his disciples. And by this occasion certain
John's disciples did envy Jesus, forasmuch as concerning he himself was lately
baptized of John: and had behaved himself as though he had been his disciple,
and also had been co^me^ded and set forth to the people by his witness, he would
now suddenly make himself equal to him: yea and moreover prefer himself
before him, in that his disciples did take upon them the thing, And there arose
a question, etc.
which hitherto none but John had done. And first of al they labored to
withdraw the people from the baptism of Jesus disciples, and went about to
persuade them that John's baptism was of more effect, in washyng away of
sins, And they came unto John.
then the baptism of Jesus. When they could not persuade the people to believe
this, they went to John, making their complaynt to him, thinking that he would
be miscontented therewith, and by sum means stay this their grief and grudge.
But this worldly affeccio^ of John's disciples, did ye more set forth Christ's
glory, and caused John to testify more manifestly of Christ. And they do
complain of the matter with these words. Master (say they) he that was lately
with you, All men come to him.
when you did baptize besides Jordan, and was baptized of you himself, yea and
even he whom ye did commend with your witness emonges the multitude, when he was
unknown to al folks, now takes upon him to do as you did, that is to say,
to baptize openly: and all men run on heaps to him, by which thing it must
needs come to pass, that by him thine authority shall be darkened. John's
disciples spoke these things of a certain carnal affeccion, desiryng to have
their masters glory and renoume to be daily increased, and for this cause they
did envy Christ, whose authority seemed to hinder John's estimacion.

When John had heard these things, he did so go about to remedy the evil
desire of his disciples, that he did not only show himself not to take
grievously that the daily increase of Jesus glory should darken his, but also
did greatly rejoice thereat. He showed that he had fully accomplyshed the office
that he was charged withal, and that now Christ's time was come, who should
perform things far more excellent. Therefore he answers on this wise. Why
will ye glory in me, of a carnal and worldly affeccion? do ye desire that I
should make my self greater then I am? Man can have nothing, except it be
given him from above. A man can receive nothing except it be. etc.
For these things be not done by man's help and strength, but by the
authority of God: that office which he has assigned to me, according to my
ability, the same have I performed faithfully. I have done the office of a
goer before: I have allured and provoked men to penance, warnyng them that the
kingdom of heaven was at hand. With the baptism of water I have prepared
many to the baptism of the spirit and fire: Ye your selves are witnesses.
etc. I am not Christ, but am sent before him.
I have showed you whom ye ought to follow from hence forth, and of whom ye
must ask perfect health. If ye regard mine authority, why do ye not give
credit to my words? your selfs can bear record, that I have diverse times
openly confessed my self not to be Christ, whom many took me to be: neither
yt I was sent for any other purpose but that I going before, should make ready
the way for him against he came. I am his servant, he is Lord of all things.
But if he now begin to be known to the world, and that his fame and renoume
does derken mine, I rejoice that my witness was true. For I did only wish and
desire, that my service might grow to that end and effect. He yt has the
bryde is the brydegrome.
For as the bryde is his by right, which is the very bridegroom in deed, and
yet he which is not the bridegroom but only his friend, does not envy the
bridegromes felicity, nor takes his spouse from him, but reioyseth on his
behalf, whom he loves in his heart: and holdyng his peace stands by him,
and also with great joy of mind hears the voice of the bridegroom whiles he
talks with his spouse: so I, who have wished for nothing more, then that he
should known to be so great a man, as of truth he is, and that I should be no
more taken for a greater man than I am in deed, do greatly rejoice, in that I
perceive this matter to have so good success. Of right he must increase, which
hitherto has been reputed to be much less, then he is in deed. And it is mere
that I should decrease, who have always be taken to be greater then I was. Thus
it is expedient for man's salvation, both that mine estimacion should be
darkened, and his glory should daily grow greater: and that my disciples
should leave me, and go to him: in comparison of whose power, mine is but
weak and of none effect. And my baptism is as far underneath his, as fire
is of more might then water.

that he testifies, and no man receives his testimony. He that has received
his testimony, has set to his scale, that God is true: for he whom God has
sent speaks the words of God. It is mete that yearthly things should give
place to heavenly, worldely to Godly, imperfect to things perfect. He that
cummeth from the earth, is earthly, and speaks things that be earthly and
base. For what other thing can man speak but things pertaining to man? What
he has seen, and heard that he testifies
but he which is come from heaven excels al men, be they never so great. We
have received but a small knowledge of heavenly things, and as we are able, so
we testify: but he does bear witness most faithfully among men, of that
thing which he has seen and heard in heaven with his father. And men have me
in admiracion, who am much his inferior, but no man almost receives his
witness: they do require me that am but a servant, to bear record of him.
And they refuse the witness that he bears of his father. And in deed if any
body do not trust me, he does but mistrust a man: if any do not believe him,
which is the only son, as the father has witnessed with his own voice,
that person makes God a lier. The Jews do wurship the father, and they
contemn and dishonor his son whom he sent: howbeit every reproach and injury
done to the son redou^deth to the father. Therefore whosoever receives the
witness of the son, he giving credit to the son, does certainly affirm God
to be true, which speaks in the son. For the son which is sent from the
father, speaks not the words of a man, but the words of God. God has
spoken both by the Prophets, and also has made every man partaker of his
spirit, according as they have been able to receive it. But God has given his
spirit to this his only son, not after any certain measure, but he has
powered upon him, the whole fulness of his spirit, so that the father has
nothing, but the son has the same.

And whatsoever the incredulity of men would take from the son, the father
imputes it to be taken from himself: for the father loves his only son
most intierly, The father loves the son. etc.
and has put in his hand, the whole sum of all things, not depriving
himself of his own power, but makes that virtue and power which he has,
common to both. And what thing soever God has willed to give and bestow upon
mankind, his pleasure was to give it by his son. And verily he offreth to
all men no small or mean thing, for he offreth everlasting life, but by him
which is the only fountain of eternal life: howbeit that person makes
himself unapt to receive this so excellent a gift, which refuses to take
it. And surely he refuses it, which does not believe that the son can give
and perform that which he promises. Moreover he does charge the father
with untruth, as who says he should promise by his son vain and untrue
things. Therefore the reward of belefe is great: and the punishment of
unbelief is fierce and terrible. For of truth, whosoever puts his hope and
trust in the son, has already the son, and whosoever has the son, He that
believes not the son shall not see life.
has eternal life. Contrariwyse he that trusts not in the son, forasmuch
as he has, as it were closed up his own iyes, that he cannot behold the
light, he shall not see life, because this light is the life of men: but he
continewyng in his sins, remains bound, and gyltie of the vengeance and
wrath of God, that is to say, everlasting death.

The.iiii. Chapter.

ANd so John with these words corrected the unmeasurable love and affecion of
his disciples toward himself, and their evil and wicked opinion concerning
Jesus: secretly prouokyng them, that they should leave him, and now follow
Jesus, of whom all men ought to ask al things. Therefore when Jesus (from whom
nothing at all was hid) did perceive the like thing to have chanced to him,
which is wont to happen amongst men, that is to say, that envy follows
praise and renoume, and also that now already the Phariseis took in evil
part, that he should allure and draw to him many disciples, and that more
people had recourse to his baptism the^ to John's, although in deed not Jesus
himself, but his disciples did baptize. (Even the^ declaring yt to preach the
gospel was a more excellent office, then to baptize.) And the Phariseis were so
much the more grieved and displeased, because his disciples did take so much
upon them as they scantly would have suffered John to have done, to whom they
did attribute very much: Jesus, I say, partly because he would not provoke,
sharpen, and stiere up their envy, in case he should have longer tarried there
and thereby should seem to have contemned them, partly because at that time he
would as it were show before, that in the time to come, after the Jews had
refused and repelled the grace of the gospel, it should be brought and given
to the Gentiles, he leaves Iewry, having begun there already the principles
of the evangelical doctrine, and prepares himself to return into Galile,
from whence he came.

But in the mean while his way was to go through Samaria, which country
the Gentiles did in old time enhabite, after they had expulsed ye Israelites
from thence, and brought thither strangers assembled out of diverse places to
dwell there. For it was so that he must needs go through Samaria.
The Samaritanes being at last taught of God by many troubles and affliccions,
did partly enbrace the religion of the Jews, for they began to wurship one
God, although after a contrary sort, and also they referred their petigrew
unto Jacob, Abraham's sons son, because he the said Jacob dwelled in times
past emo^ges the Caldeis. The Samaritanes did receive Moses books only, but the
Prophets they did not allow. And that people took their name of the mount
Samor. Than he came to a city. etc.
Therefore the Jews did bear cruel and common hatred against them, remembryng
how once they won their country by violence, and had put the inhabitauntes
thereof out of their dwelling places. And also forbecause of their contrary
rites and customs, in most part of things. For they had so received Moses
law, yt yet there did remain many tokens of their old supersticio^. Therefore
when Jesus was cum to a city of Samaria called Sichar, and he lacked meat
(for the disciples did so much attend upon their master, that they had made
no provision for any vitels) Jesus himself went not into the mids of the
city, because he would not give a just occasion to the Jews to lay to his
charge, that having forsaken the Israelites, he did go to the heathen and
wicked Gentiles, as afterward in great despite they called him Samaritane, and
a man possessed with a devil, but he suffered his disciples to go into the
city to bye meat. He himself tarried there alone, partly to look for and
abide the return of his disciples, and partly because he would not be absente
when occasion should serve him to do a miracle. For he knew before what should
happen after: and there was that portion of ground which Jacob had given
Joseph his son to possess. The place was holy and famous emo^ges the
Samaritanes for the memorial of the old story, because Leui and Simeon had
revenged in that place the vilanye of the rauishyng of Dina with a great
slaughter and destruction of the inhabitauntes there. There was also a well very
notable among the people, even for because Jacob had dug it, in whom, as I
said before, the Samaritanes do glory as in their first progenitour and
auctour of their lineage. Then Jesus being weary of his long journey, which he
had goen all on fore, and not on horse back or in a wagon (even then giving us
an exaumple what manner a man a preacher of the gospel ought to be) sat him
down there, as the place served nigh unto the well, And it was about the sixth
hour.
and (as it were) refreshed himself with the air thereof. And it was then
about six of the clock after the Jews computacion, when the son already
drawyng toward nonetyde, does with heat double the paynfulnes of Jesus
labor. And by these tokens Jesus did declare himself to be a very man in
deed, subject even to the self same passions whereunto the bodies of other men
be subject. In the mean while in came a certain woman of Samaria thither to
draw water out of the same well, nighe unto which Jesus did sit. To whom
Jesus, because furthwith he would mynister to her matter of communicacion, and
would go about to bring her to salvation upon the occasion of that thing which
she did herself, says in this manier: Woman give me drink. And it chanced
well yt the Apostles in the mean while were absent, because Jesus would speak
certain secret things to her, which if he had spoken in presence of others,
it might have been thought a point of lightness. In the which thing* certes the
Lord Jesus showed and gave to the teachers of the gospel an example of sobre
behaueour and gentleness, His disciples were goen away unto the town to bye
meat*
who does so little disdayn to talk with a sinful woman, and one that had
naughtely and vnchastely misused her body with diverse, that also by the means
of his being with her alone, he did provided for the bashefulnes of the unchaste
woman. The woman perceiving by Jesus tongue and apparel also that he was a
Jew, and knowing right welt how much the Jews are wont to abhore the
cumpanye of the Samaritanes, insomuche that they thought themselves also to be
defiled when they do either mete or speak with any of them, she having great
marvel that he of his own good will called to her, and asked drink of her
answers in this wise: How comes this to pass, that thou being a Jew (as
I may well conjecture by thy speech and garment) do contrary to the
custom of the Jews, ask drink of me that am a Samaritane, consyderyng that
ye Jews are wont to abhor to have any thing to do with the Samaritanes,
accomptyng it a thing detestable to have any familiarity or conversation with
us. But Jesus who did not so much thirste for that kind of water (albeit as
concerning his manhed he was a thirst in deed) as he did couete the health of
the souls, little by little does allure the poor woman to the knowledge of the
grace of the gospel: aunsweryng her after this sort by a dark saying: to
the intent he might the more kindle in her a desire to learn. If thou did
know, says he, how excellent that gift is which now God does offer unto
you, and in case thou knew him also which at this present asks water to
drink of thee thou would rather ask drink of him, and he could give unto
thee far better water then this is, that is to say, the water of life.

Forasmuch as this was spoken of the spirit which the beleuers in the
gospel should receive, it is no meruaill though a poor selie woman of
Samaria did not understand it, seeing that Nicodemus being both a Jew and a
master could not perceive that thing, which Jesus had spoken sumwhat more
plainly, concerning being borne again from above, yea and yet did he answer
more grossly then this woman. For he said: can a man when he is old enter
again into his mothers womb, and so be borne a new? But this woman after she
had conceived a certain great high thing of this saying of Jesus, (If thou
knew the gift of God, and if thou knew who he were, and he could give
thee water of life,) she was not misconte^t that he seemed little to regard
Jacobs well, which she had in great reverence, neither yet did she mock the
bold sayings of him, which was to her both a stranger unknown and also a
Jew, but she desyryng to learn what this was which he did so set forth as a
thing strange and notable, in token of honor calls him Lord, as who says,
she had already conceived no small opinion of him. But in the mean while this
exaumple of the woman of Samaria was thus devised and brought to pass by the
ordinance of gods counsel, to rebuke and declare thereby the perverse
frowardnes of the Jews, which were so far from showing themselves easy to
be taught of our lord Jesus, that they did wiekedly despise his benefits, and
find fault with his wholesome doctrine, whereas this poor woman having a desire
to be taught, did courteously and gently answer to al things, insomuche that
she tarying still in the heat, and having forgotten the thing for which she
came, gave head to his words, who was to her both unknown and a stranger,
and of whom as yet she had heard no notable report. Sir, says she, thou
do promise unto me water far more excellent then this, The woman says
unto him. etc.
but thou have no vessel wherewith to draw the same, and the well is diepe.
Therefore, how should thou come by this lively water, which thou do
promise? Art thou greater the^ our father Jacob, whom ye Jews also have in
reverence? He gave this well unto us as a notable gift, and did so much set by
this water, that he himself was wont to drink thereof with all his family, and
also his cattle. Jesus perceiving that the woman was apt to be taught, which
did not suspect him to be a southsayer or an enchaunter, but some notable great
man whom she thought worthy to be compared with Jacob (a man highly esteemed of
her) Jesus, I say, does not disdeyne to allure her by little and little to have
him in higher and greatter estimacion, showing how the water whereof he did
speak is spiritual, which should not refreshe beasts, but souls. Whosoever
drynketh (says he) of this water which the Patriarche Jacob gave unto you,
does but only for a short time slake the bodily thirst, which within a
while after will return again. But to thintente that thou may understand
how much this gift of God (whereof I have spoken) is more excellent then the
gift of Jacob, and how much the water (which I promise) is better then this
water which flows forth out of the veins of the earth: if any man drink
of this water which I shall give him (if he desire it,) he shall not thirste
eternally, neither shall any thirste ever after put him in any ieoperdye, nor
yet shall he need from time to time any where else to ask water, but after he
has once drunken this water, it shall remain in him which has druncke it,
and shall bring forth in the same a fountain perpetually springing up even unto
life everlasting. Jesus spoke these things by a dark similitude, knowing that
the woman was not yet hable to receive the ministry of faith, by the which
the holy ghost is given, who being once received, never failleth, but does
still go forward whilst it brings man up to eternal life. But the
simplicity of this woman was so great, that whereas the Jews are wont
ouerthwartly and wrongfully to interpret such manner of parables, she not
understanding what he said, but yet both believing and loving him, said: Lord
I pray the give me part of this water, that I be not compelled by being often
and sundry times a thirst, to go unto this well, and draw thereof. Albeit this
answer was gross, yet nevertheless it did declare that her mind was inclined
and ready to believe.

Therefore because she had already conceived no small opinion of Jesus, he
does inuit and move her further with greater tokens and proves of his godhead
to think yet more highly of him. Jesus then, as though he would not open so
secret a matier to her, unless her husband were present, commands her to
call her husband, and bryngyng him with her, to return again to him by and
by. When the woman had heard this, thinkyng that she spoke but to a man, and by
the reason of womanly shamefastnes, desiryng to dissemble and hide her vicious
living, and with denial of matrimony to keep secret her aduoutrie, she
says: Sir I have no husband. Here Jesus both declaryng his godhed and
gentely reprouyng the woman's life, says unto her: In that thou say thou
have no husband, thou have told the truth, for although thou have had five
husbands to satisfy thy filthy lust, yet never a one of them was lawful, yea
and even very he whom thou now have, is not thy lawful husband. Therefore in
this point thou have spoken nothing but truth.

father in spirit, and in the truth: For such the father also requires to
wurship him. God is a spirit; and they that wurship him must wurship him in
spirit and in the truth. The woman when she perceived the rebukeful sins of
her life, committed at home, not to be hidden from Jesus, being a straungier and
also a Jew, who could not know by the report of men, that thing which he
did disclose, she shrynketh not away from him, as one confounded with shame,
neither is she with anger moved to answer him again spitefully, but so much
the more she is inflamed to have him in great admiracion: whereas if Jesus had
spoken any such thing unto the Phariseis, they would have cried out and said:
he is an enchaunter and possessed with a devil. Sir I perceive that thou art a
prophet.
But what answer made this godly sinner the Samaritane? Sir says she (as I
perceive) thou art a prophet. The feith of the woman was come to this point.
At the first she calls him but a Jew: and meruaileth that he did no more
earnestly observe the Jews religion, because that contrary to the custom of
other Jews he did ask drink of a Samaritane. Anon after she calls him
Lord. Here now she attributes unto him the name of a Prophet, because even
of himself he knew the secrets of other. our fathers wurshipped in this
mountain.
And at last she desyryng to learn certain higher things of this prophet,
ceased to speak of low and mean matters, and propounds to him a question,
(as a thing) to her thynkyng, impossible to be assoyled concerning the way and
manner how to wurship God, because in this point the Jews and the Samaritanes
did very much disagree. For albeit both those kinds of people did wurship
one god, yet the Jews had an opinion that God should be wurshipped in no place
but only at Jerusalem in the temple, as though God did no where else hear the
desires of them that did pray. Co^trariwyse the Samaritanes with like
supersticion (but after another sort) denied that God should be wurshipped in
any place but in the mount Garizim, because that place was appointed by Moses
where the Patriarchs should bless the people that kept the commandments of
God. And forasmuch as both these nations, being well pleased with their own
several rites and customs, did the one of them contemn the religion of the
other, the woman desired to learn of Jesus (as of a Prophet not ignorant in
such things) which of those two nations had the holiest way in seruyng of
God, as one that would follow that way which she should know to be best.

And ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to wurship.
Therefore she says: Our elders were wont to wurship God in this mount, and they
think it not lawful to wurship him in any other place, where as you Jews
contrariewyse accoumpt it abominable to do sacrifices in high places and
groves, and that it is not lawful to wurship God any other where then at
Jerusalem in the temple: whereof they do glory, as though God were shut up in
a house builded with man's hand. Because this question of the woman did
apperteine to the learning of true godlynes, Jesus opens and declares to her
how that after the true and spiritual wurshippyng of god should be set
forth by the doctrine of the ghospel, the supersticious religion of the gods
and devils of the Gentiles should be utterly extinguished: yea and also that
the manner of the Samaritanes wurshyppyng of God, should be abolyshed, which
had no such judgment of god as they ought to have: but took him to be as a
certain special deuell, and did mix the wurshippyng of him with the
wurshippyng of devils, mingling and confounding together the wicked
supersticion of the Gentiles with the wurshyppyng of God, as a man should put
fire to water: and following the said Gentiles exaumple, did their sacrifices
in hye groves and mountains. And furthermore he showed her that the Jews
religion which (as the time required) had been hitherto gross and carnal: and
did rather represent certain shadows of true godliness the^ very godliness it
self, should encreace unto more perfeccion, and that God being afterward more
fully known through the son and the holy ghost, should be wurshipped not
only in Jury, but through the whole world: yea and that in more holy temples
then the temple of Jerusalem was, that is to say, in the pure minds of me^
which God had dedicate unto himself with his spirit, and is not now to be
pacified with the sauoure of burt offreynges of beasts, but with holy prayers,
godly desires, and chaste affeccions. But before Jesus would open this mystery
of the godliness of the gospel: he speaks first of feith, without which none
is mete to be a hearer of the evangelical doctrine, neither fit to be a
wurshipper of Christ's religion: for faith only does purify the hertes and
makes them apt to be put in trust with the secrets of heavenly wisdom.
Woman (says he) believe me (if thou take me for a Prophet in deed) the time is
come now, when both the vnpure wurshippyng of the Samaritanes shall be abolyshed:
and also the carnal religion of the Jews shall be turned into better, neither
shall ye herafter wurship the father in this mountain (who is not only the God
of this mountain, but also of the whole world) ne yet at Jerusalem: Ye
wurship ye w^^ no^ what, we know what we wurshippe. etc.
but wheresoever shall be the congregation of good and godly people, there shall
hereafter be Jerusalem. In the mean while, we Jews do excel you in this
behalf, that we wurship God whom we know by the law, and whom we do confess
to be the Lord of all things and all people: nor we do not defile the
wurshipping of him, who is only to be honored, with the wurshipping of other
Gods. You wurship you cannot tell what, supposing God to be no bodies God but
the Jews and your own, yea and ye take him to be such a one as would suffer
himself to be matched with deuyls: whereas all godly honor is due to him
alone. The law has taught the Jews these things. And by Gods commandment
there was a temple builded at Jerusalem to wurship one God therein, which should
be a figure of the spiritual temple. There were priests ordained, and also
rytes and ceremonies of sacrifices as it were with certain shadows betokening
the holiness of the gospel. Therefore the Jews do excel you herin, that both
we have a better judgment of God then you have, and also that we do not
pollute or defile ye wurshipping of him with any profane wurshippinges of
other Gods. And moreover we do excel you in that we do wurshippe him in a
place appointed of God himself, and with rytes and ceremonies of his own
teaching. Howbeit in ye mean while this our religion although it be not
perfect, yet it is (as it were) a step or furtherau^ce toward perfect honoring
of God. Therefore eternal health came first of the Jews, to whom the
Prophets have promised Messiah to come, which by the means of the law have
the fygures and shadows of the religion of the gospel. Now the time is come
that the false religion of the Gentiles must give place, and that both the
carnal wurshipping must give glace to the spiritual wurshipping of God, and
also the shadows of the law to the light of the gospel. For now I tell you
the time is at hand, yea it is already present, when true wurshippers, shall
wurshippe the father not in temples, not with beasts, nor with bodily things,
but in the spirit: not with shadows, but with truth. For God seeing he is a
spirit, is not delyted with the pureness of the body, nor with the walls of
the temple, neither yet to have beasts offered in sacrifices, but he loves
spiritual wurshippers, of whom he may be wurshipped according to the spirit
and truth. For there has been hitherto enough attributed to the shadows and
figures of Moses law: Hereafter whersoeuer there shall be a mind pure from
sin through the faith of the ghospel, there shall be a worthy temple for God.
Whersoeuer there shall be heavenly desiers, pure prayers, and holy thoughts,
there shall be sacrifices wherewith God is pleased.

The simple and pacient belefe of this woman of Samaria did so much profit by
the forsaid communicacion of Jesus, that she now supposes him (whom first she
had called a Jew, then a Lord, and after a Prophet) to be Messiah himself.
For the Samaritanes also by the promise of Moses, did look for that excellent
Prophet to arise and come of the Jews. Therefore she answered after this
sort: I know that Messiah shall come whom the Jews do look for, I know y^
Messiah shall come* which is called Christ.
of whom already there is a rumoure among the Jews. Therefore when he shall
come, he shall declare unto us all these things which thou haste spoken
concerning the new manner of the wurshippyng of God, neither shall he suffer us
to be ignoraunte in any thing. Jesus perceyuyng the belefe of the woman apt to
be taught, and such feruente desire to know the truth, as he had not found
the like among his country men the Jews, he vouchesalueth therefore to open
and declare unto her who he was. Thou lokest (says he) for Messiah to come,
Jesus says unto her: I that speak unto the am he.
be thou assured he is come, and even now thou see him, for I that do talk
with the am he in deed. And as soon as these things were spoken, his
disciples returnyng from the town came thither, and before they came at him,
perceived that he talked with a woman of Samaria, and did marvel at his so
great gentleness. Yet no man durst ask him what thing he required of the
woman, or for what cause he had talked with her. But the woman being amassed
with the saying of the Lord Jesus, did answer nothing at all: but leaving her
waterpotte at the well (for now the thirsting for that water was clearly gone
and forgotten, after she had tasted of the water which Christ had promised)
she makes haste toward the city, and of a synful Samaritane suddenly became
a messenger, and as it were an Apostle in that she does declare this thing
openly to all folks, to the intent that the knowledge of many should confirm
her feith: Come, says she, and see a man to be meruailed at, and one that
knows all secrets, who although he be a stranger and one that I never saw
before, yet has he told me all the secrets that I have done, it is possible
that the same is Messiah. Trust not my words, prove the thing your selves and
ye shall find me no liar.

In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying: Master eat. He said
unto them: I have meat to eat that you know not of. Therefore said the
disciples amongst themselves: has any man brought him ought to eat? Jesus
says unto them: my meat is to do the will of him that has sent me, and to
finishe his work. Say not ye there are yet four months and than cummeth
harvest? Behold I say unto you, lift up your iyes and look on the regions
for they are all white already unto ha^uest, and he that reapeth receives
reward, and gathers fruit unto life eternal, that both he that sows and
he that reapeth might rejoice together. And herein is the saying true that one
sows and another reapeth. I send you to reap that, whereon you bestowed no
labor. Other men labored and year entered into their labors. Whiles the
woman did brute abroad this rumor emonges the citizens of Sychar, in the
mean time Jesus disciples supposyng him to be payned with houngre, moved him
to take such meats as they had brought. But Jesus every where taking occasion
to draw men up from the care of bodilye things, to the desire of spiritual
things: like as he had allured and drawn the woman to the knowlage of the
faith of the gospel by his speaking of the water, so by the occasion of
meats he provoke his disciples that were as yet but ignorant, to be
diligent in preaching the ghospel: yea and peradventure at that time he did not
so much thyrste for the water of the well, and although he did so, yet did he
more desire and thirst for man's salvation: nevertheless the affeccion of the
woman which came to draw water, gave him occasion of this godly
co^municacion: In like manner although he was then hungry in that he was a very
man, I have meat to eat that ye know not. etc.
he was much more hungry to save mankind, for which cause he descended from
heaven. Therefore he said unto his disciples which moved him to take his
bodilye refeccion: I have other meat to eat (says he) and such meat as I
delight more in, then in that which you bring me. His disciples meruailyng what
this saying mente, and yet not bold to ask their master for reverence they
bare unto him, lest he should be any thing offended therewith, talked thus
among themselves: what means he by this? has any other body whiles we were
absent brought him any meat? But Jesus because he would now imprint in their
minds the thing which he had spoken before darkely, Jesus says unto them:
my meat is to do the will of him that has sent me.
says now openly: I pass very little (says he) upon this bodily meat.
There is an other kind of meat which I do specially care for: that is to
say, to accomplish that thing for which cause my heavenly father has sent
me hither. This is my houngre, this is my thirst to go about the thing which he
has commanded me. Both the time provoke, and the promptenes of men's minds
to the faith of the gospel, do also require the diligence of preachers. If
you which do so much care for the wealth and commodity of ye bodies, know
that harvest is at hand four months after that seed time is past, Say not
ye there are yet.iiii. months end than cummeth harvest?
how much more ought we to regard the time of our spiritual harueste? And as
when the corn begins to grow yealowe, it does (as it were) require a
fyckle, and the diligence of reapers: so if you will lift up your iyes and
behold the corn that grows in men's minds, yea even in them emonges the
Samaritanes and Heathen, which make haste to the doctrine of the gospel, ye
shall perceive the regions and countries on every side to be as it were reapyng
ripe to the harvest of the gospel and to require our labor and dilygence.
But if the hope of yearthly fruit does soon provoke the reaper to his
labor, how much more ought we to be forward to gather this harueste to our
father, which both shall obtain for the reaper a right large reward in
heaven, and shall gather for God, not wheat into the barnes, but the souls of
men into everlasting life? And so it shall come to pass that both the sowier
and the reaper shall rejoice together. For that thing happens to you which
is wont to be spoken, in a common proverb, one sows and another reapeth:
there is more pain and labor about the tilling and sowing, And herein is
the saying true that one sows and an other reapeth.
then in the harvest and reapyng. The ground must be plowed, the cloddes
must be broken with the harowe, the field must be dunged, the sede must be
sown, covered with earth, attended and kept, the cokle also must be weeded
out, but after when the corn is ripe, there is not so great a do about the
reapyng thereof: and the fruit being ripe and ready does mitigate the
tediousness of the labor, but in this spiritual harvest it happens much
otherwise then in the bodily harvest: for there (according to the common
proverb) as often as the fruit and commodity of the harvest, cu^meth to
another then to him that sows, the reaper in deed rejoices but the sowier is
grieuosly vexed. In this spiritual harvest it is otherwise, for both the
sowier and the reaper reioyseth, and neither of them lacks their fruit and
commodity. I have sent you to reap the corn, in sowyng whereof ye bestowed no
labor. The prophets have tilled the ground with their travail, and have with
their doctrine prepared to the gospel, the world being as at that time
intractable: ye now succeed and enter upon their labor, and go about a thing
prepared to your hand, by reason that the world now applies it self to
receive willyngly heavenly doctrine, and men goes about to prease into the
kingdom of heaven, in manner by violence.

Whiles our Lord with the sayings does exhort his disciples toward the
bu^sines of the gospel, the thing it self does declare that to be true
which he had spoken of the corn waxing white and ripe toward the harvest.
For in the city many Samaritanes did believe that Messiah was come: whereas
that woman had testified nothing else of Jesus, but that he had opened and
declared unto her the secret shameful deeds of her life time. As yet they
had neither heard him speak, nor seen him do any miracle. So ready was yea
even their belief which seemed to be far from the promises of the Prophets.
Therefore a multitude of the Samaritanes came renning out of the city to see
him, whom the foresayed woman had so earnestly commended and set furthe unto
them. Neither does his presence diminishe their opinion of him, neither be
they offended with his homely and course apparel, ne yet with his slendre
train of his simple and unlearned disciples: whereas the Jews after that they
had seen so many of his miracles, heard so many of his sermons, and received
so many commodities and benefits at his hand, did either falselye accuse him,
openly rebuke him, or else chased him away with castyng stones at him. In
conclusion the Samaritanes upon a woman's report and witness, go forth to
mete with a man which was not of their own nation, whom as yet they had
never heard speak, of whom they had never seen any notable thing done, And he
abode there ii. days.
and yet do they require and desire him to be contented to take a lodging in
their city. But what did most gentle Jesus? he knew the envy of the Jews,
he knew what hatered they bare to the Samaritanes, and yet the time was not
come that the gospel should be taken from them being rejected for their
invincible lack of belief, and should be preached to the Gentiles. Therefore
he so tempered the matter, that he neither gave by apparaunt proof, any
occasion to his own country men the Jews to complain that they were
despised of him, and the Samaritanes preferred before the^: considering the
Prophecy promised that Messiah should come to them: neither yet would he
utterly disapointe the godly belief of the Samaritanes. For in that he went
through Samaria, he did even of very necessity. And at their request, to tarry
there but two days, was good manner and gentleness, wherewith no man of right
could find fault. And now when they had heard Jesus, many more there did
believe, and their belief was stablished, which upon the report of one woman,
had conceived a notable opinion of Jesus. And now they bear a full witness of
Jesus: and such a testimony as was right semyng for a very true Jew, saying
to the woman: Thou haste reported less of him then the thing requires. For we
now do believe him to be Messiah, not by the persuasion of thy words, but we
our selfs do assuredly know by his woonderful communicacion that he is the
very true Messiah which was looked for of the Jews: who shall bring salvation
not only to them but to the whole world. With this so cherefull, and so full a
witness, the Samaritanes did both declare their own belief, and therewithal
reproved the wicked unbelief of the Jews.

Therefore Jesus because he would give no occasion to the Jews of greater
hatred and envy: wrought no miracle among the Samaritanes neither turned he in
to them but by the way, and at their desire, nor yet did not he lodge among
them longer then two days, but forthwith he makes an end of his purposed
journey, and so goes forth on his way into Galile. Moreover albeit his own
country lay in his way here in this journey, yet would he not turn into it:
not that he did despise it, but that by reason of the contempt and lack of
belefe of his own countreymenne, to whom he was known and also of kindered,
as concerning his ma^hood, he had no hope that the gospel should bring forth
any fruit there, and than his preaching should have doubled the fault of
their unbelief. For by this means their fault was the less in not believing
Jesus doctrine. And when our Lord was asked the question why he did not go to
his own nation to show of what power he was: in his answer he used that
ancient proverb which the common people uses, that is to say: a Prophet
is nowhere contemned but in his own country and among his own kinsfolks.
For such are the affeccio^s of men, that familiarity brings contempt. And
they exteme many things for none other cause, but that they come from far
and strange countries. Furthermore forasmuch as in Galile by reason of John's
testimony and the miracle which Jesus himself had done there of late, a right
honest brute and fame was spread of him, they of Galile received him when he
came thither, specially because at Jerusalem they had seen him drive the buyers
and sellers out of the Temple, and other things which he had done there with
great authority in the presence of the people: for at that time they also of
Galile were assembled at Jerusalem to keep the holy and feastfull day. All
these things verily do condemn the incredulity of the Phariseis, and
betoken that the grace of the gospel shall remove from them to the Gentiles.
The Samaritanes do believe at the report of one simple woman: They do in
manner force him being a stranger to lodge with them: They confess him to be
Messiah and the redemer of the world, when as yet he had not vouchsaued to
work any miracle among them. The people of Galile (being but a gross nacio^
and unlearned in the law) who never had any Prophet among them, after they
had seen his miracles, began to believe. They of Jerusalem both priests,
Phariseis, and Scribes, which seemed to keep most perfectly the religion of
the Jews, and also were excellently learned in the law: did obstinately find
fault both with Jesus doings and sayings. Therefore the more just and
religious every man thought himself to be, so much the farther was he from
the godliness of the gospel: and again the further of he seemed in man's
judgment from the knowledge of the Prophets and the law, which did promise
Christ, and the more contrariouse to the Jews religion, so much the nerer he
was unto Christ: whom the law had promised to come, and more apt to receive
the doctrine of the gospel.

Therefore Jesus being entered into Galile, went again to Cana a town of the
said Galile: where not long before he had turned water into wine. That miracle
at the first being known but to a few, when afterward it was commonly bruted
abroad: caused the people to have some good opinion of Jesus, but yet not such
as was wurthy for his dignity, for very few did believe that he was Messiah,
and many took him to be but a prophet. Therefore Jesus went again to Cana not
to get any praise for the miracle which he had done there, but now at this time
to reap some corn of that sede which he had sown secretly: for this was the
thing that he thirsted for and coueted, that is to say, the faith of men wurthy
of the gospel: and here again an occasion rose to lay to ye Jews charge
their unbelief: for at that time there was in Galile a certain ruler which was
the Emperors deputy in profane and temporal causes, who was neither Jew
nor Samaritane, but an heathen manne, and clean contrary from the Jews,
religion: he had a son whom he loved entierly, which lay very sore sick and
in great danger of life in the city of Capernaum: when he heard that Jesus
had left Iewry and was come into Galile, he leaving his son at home, departed
out of the city of Capernaum and came to Jesus, requiring him very earnestly
to go with him to Capernau^ and heal his son, because the vehemency of his
disease was such, that the sick man could not be carried to Jesus: for he was
eue^ at the point of death when the forsayed ruler departed from him. Now
Jesus declaring ye faith of this ruler to be as yet imperfect, in that he did
not rather believe that his son could be healed unless Jesus himself had gone
thither, as though he called upon a physician, or else as though Jesus could not
restore even the dead unto life: but Jesus rather rebuking the incredulity of
certain Jews, which would not believe, after they had seen his miracles, says
unto the ruler: I do allow their belefe (says he) which do credit my
word alone, without confirmacion of miracles: ye believe not me unless you see
tokens and miracles. The ruler was so myndful of his sons peril and
ieopardy, that he made no answer to this saying of our Lord Jesus, because he
thought such co^municacion was but a wasting of time, whereas the disease
required a present remedy. The ruler says unto him.
Therefore he requires him more importunately to make haste to come to
Capernaum, before his son were dead, as though he should come in vain in
case he did come after he had given up the ghost, whereas it was as easy to
Jesus to call again the life after it was once past, as to keep the same in the
body when it was ready to go out thereof. Jesus says unto him: go thy way,
thy son lives.
Therefore Jesus without rebuking the rulers faith, shows by the deed it
self, that he can do much more then the ruler trusted that he could do: I
need not (says he) for this cause go to Capernaum. Go thy way, thy son whom
thou did leave at the point of death, is now alive and in health. The
rulers faith was somewhat stayed by this saying, Then he enquired of them the
hour wha^ he began to amend.
for he (trusting to Jesus word) makes haste homewarde. And as he was going
thither, his servants met with him to bring the father good tidinges of his
child: that is to say, that he which was a little before at point of death
was sodeinly recovered: and that he should not trouble Jesus, of whose help
they had no need: for they supposed that the child had recovered his health
but by hap, as men that were ignorant what was done between the ruler and
Jesus. In this point verily the rulers lack of full trust, being mixte with
some hope, caused the miracle to be better believed. For the ruler desirouse to
know the truth certainly whether his son was restored to health again by
chance, or by the power of Jesus, enquired of his servants at what hour his
son began to amend. Yesterday (say they) at the seventh hour, that was about
one of the clock at after none, the fever sodeinly left him, and byanby your
son was whole. The father knew that even at that very hour Jesus said unto
him, So the father knew etc.
go home, thy son lives: and than he was well assured that his son was
revived not by chance, but through the power of Jesus. And though this miracle
was wrought upon an heathen man, And he believed, and al his hou^holde.
yet much fruit came thereof: for not only the ruler himself believed that
Christ was Messiah, but also by his persuasion and exaumple his whole household
believed the same, which must needs have much people in it, considering that he
was rich, and a man of high authority, whereas Jesus after he had wrought
many miracles amongst his own countreyme^ and kinsfolks, had much a do to win a few to the gospel. This is the second miracle,
This is the second miracle that Jesus wrought when he was come out of Iewry
into Galile, to the intent that he might confirm again the former miracle
which he had wrought in Cana, with doing an other that was greater then it,
and by the example of a profane and heathen manne, might provoke his own
countrymen unto faith: and did even than by that occasion, as it were,
pronosticate and signify, both that the Jews should be repelled for their
incredulity, and the Gentiles through faith received to the grace of the
gospel.

The.v. Chapter.

AFter that Jesus had in this wise begun his matters among the Samaritanes,
and the people of Galile, he goes again to Jerusalem, even about the feast of
Penthechost, intendyng there by reason of the great resort of people, to
declare and setforth his authority to many, and to reprove ye Phariseis of
their infidelity, (which swelled in pride through false persuasion of holiness
and knowledge) whom now the Samaritanes and heathen did so much excel. And
there is at Jerusalem by the slaughter house, apoole. etc.
At Ierusalm verily there was a poole or a certain deep lake of water, which
the Greeks calls probatica, taking that name of cattle, because the priests
were wont there to wash the sacrifices that were to be offered: and of a like
reason it is called in Hebrew Bethsaida, as a man would say, a slaughter house,
or an house of cattle. This lake has five porches over it. In these porches
lay a great number of men that were sick of diverse bodily diseases: and
besides that, there was a great multitude of folks that were blind, that
halted, and were lame, abiding and lokyng for the mouyng of the water: for the
Angel of the Lord went down at certain times into the poole, and
therwithall the water was moved: who so than (after the Angel had stiered the
water) stepped first into the poole, he was made whole, were he sick, or
whatsoever bodily mayme he had. And even at that time was this a figure of
baptism, whereby the filthiness and diseases of our souls (be they never so
deadly) are washed away at once, so often as the office of the baptiser and
Gods operacion from above, be concurrant with the element of the water. There
is no doubt but by this occasion much people at that time were in that place,
either of such as were gathered together there, to behold and see what was
done, or else of them which did attend upon the sick folks that lay in the
five porches.

And a certain man was there, which had been diseased.xxxviii. year: when
Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he now long time had been diseased, he
says unto him: wylt thou be made whole? The sick man answered him: Sir I
have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the poole, but in the
mean time while I am about to come, an other steppeth down before me. Jesus
says unto him: rise, take up thy bed, and walk. And immediately the man
was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. And because the miracle might
be the more notable, Jesus did chose out from among all the sick folk, one
which was of them all furthest from hope of recovery, whose disease was
dangerouse and almost incurable, and had also holden him a long time: finally
the said manne most of all lacked the help and succor of other men, and was
so poor, that he was not able to provide any man, by whom he might at due time
be carried down into the water. Nor any one of the multitude was cured but only
he, whose chance was first to go down into the water. This man's great misery
must needs setforth the greatness of the miracle, and the same man's faith helped
much to the example of other. For the palsy had vexed him.xxx. years
together: to teach us that there is no disease of the soul so deadly and of
so long co^tinuaunce, When Jesus saw him lie. etc.
but that baptism and faith in Jesus, may easily take it away. Therefore when
that most merciful Jesus had beholden this sick man of the palsy, whom
every body pitied, lying withal his members looce and shaking by reason of
that disease: and also perceived that sickness so much the more to be
dispayred of, for that it had holden already the miserable creature thirty
years together: He said unto him: will thou be made whole?
Jesus, I say, being moved with mercy, said unto him: will thou be made
whole? wyllyng to declare hereby to the standers by, the faith and sufferaunce
of that man, and also to make them besides this, perceive the violence of that
disease, declaryng thereby, how no man can be cured of the vices of the soul,
unless he hate his own sickness, and have a desire to be made whole. For it is
not to be doubted but that he desired health, which so many years had lain
besides that poole with a constante hope of health, and being so often
disapointed, Sir I have no man. etc.
ceased not from his hope nor dispaired. Therefore the sick man of the palsy,
made no answer to Jesus question, and yet conceyuing some good hope upon his
so cherefull demand, shows that he lacks no will, nor that he mistrusteth
for all the greatness and long continuance of his disease, but that he should
be healed, in case he were brought into ye poole: howbeit (he says) he lacks
a man to help to bear him, who might in due season carry him into the poole,
as soon as the water should be stirred. For when other perceived that ye poole
was stirred, every man made haste for himself to enter first and so to obtain
alone the benefit of health: but as for the said sick man, being slow by
reason of his disease, and lackyng one to bear him, did but in vain crepe
forth toward the lake, for as much as an other had gone into it before him.
Truly the sick man's meaning in this his saying was lowely and shamefastly,
to desire Jesus that he being a man of strength, and piteouse as it seemed by
his words, would when time were, carry him down into the poole: which thing
he durst not require of him openly: but yet after he had disclosed his
necessity, he showed what hindered his health, for the sick man knew not Jesus.
But Jesus being well pleased with the man's pacient sufferau^ce, which did not
as the most part of such miserable creatures are wont to do, that is to
say, cry out, wish himself dead, and curse the day he was borne in: neither
was he offended with Jesus askyng him whether he would be made whole or no, and
therefore did not say or make any clamor that Jesus had him in derision: our
Lord being in likewise moved with his so constant hope to recover his health,
and in conclusion willing to show, both that they which were healed by the
mouyng of the foresaid poole, were cured by his power, and that it was an easy
and ready thing for him, even only with a beck to take away all diseases,
both of body and soul, he said unto the sick man: rise, take up thy couche,
and go thy way. And the word was no sooner spoken, but the man was healed,
and so healed, that not only he was clearly delivered from his disease, who else
should have been fainte and feeble, like as they are wont to be, which are cured
by phisike: but this man (I say) was so thoroughly healed, y^ without any stay
of man's help, he rose up upon his fete, carried away his bed upon his
shoulders, and so being strong enough to bear his own bed, did walk forth,
and bare it home in all men's sight, as a remembrance of his long continued
disease.

And the same day was the Sabbath. etc.
And it was the Sabbath day when the sick man of the palsy did these things,
whereat the Phariseis took occasion to find fault with him: which Phariseis
did supersticiously maintain such things of the law, as were carnal and
given but for a time: and conte^ned those things which were chief and should
still continue: among the^ it was counted a wicked deed to do any business on
the Sabbath day, but to deceive their neighbor upon the Sabbath day, they
took it but for a trifle. They would have it seem an ungodly thing that a poor
sick man should carry away his bed upon the Sabbath day, but to grudge and
envy his health, they thought it no fault. They knew this man which was sick
of the palsy well enough, and that he had lain sick many years. They did well
perceive that he was now strong, and had no toke^ or appearance of his disease
in him. Of so great a miracle, they ought both to have glorified God, and to
have reioysed in his behalf which was cured, unless they had been very wicked
against god, and enuiouse toward their neighbor. Therefore these, like
peruerters of true religion, fall in hand and chide with him, which carried
away his couche. This is the Sabbath day (say they) which ought to be kept
with rest and quiet. It is not lawful for the to carry away thy couche: he not
dissemblyng the benefit that he had received, and to deliver himself from
their envy of that fault, by the authority of Jesus, showing that he which
could do so great a thing with his word, seemed to be greater than either
man or the Sabbath day, the poor man (I say) makes this answer to ye
spiteful Jews: he that made me whole with his very word only, commanded me
to carry away my couche and walk. When they heard this (whereas they ought by
reason of the miracle to have believed it) they did not only envy him that was
cured, Tha asked they him what man is that. etc.
but also went about to devise matter against him by whom he was cured: who is
ye man (say they) which badde thee carry away thy couche and walk? for they
would have burdened him with the fault of breaking ye Sabbath day, as they had
done many times before. Now he that was healed, knew not Jesus by name, but
only by sight: howbeit at that time he could not show him unto them, because
that Jesus after he had spoken to the sick man of the palsy, immediately
withdrewe himself from the multitude: partly lest his presence should more
provoke the Jews envy, and partly that he being absente, the miracle should
be the better known by the report of him which had felt the benefit of
health.

But after the miracle was made manifest and evidently proved, Jesus willing
that the autour thereof also should be known, when he met with the man upon
whom he had bestowed that benefit of health, he said unto him: behold, thou
have obtained health, The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus.
and art delivered from the bodily sickness which came to the, by reason that
thy soul was sick, I have cured thee of both those diseases. Take thou good
head hereafter that thou fall not again into thine old former sins, and
thereby cause thy self to have some wourse disease. Therefore after the man that
was made whole knew that this was he which before had commanded him to
carrye away his couche, and which now also having testified himself to be
the author of health, did monish and warn him to beware lest he should fall
again into some sorer and wurse disease, by committing and renewyng sin:
also perceyuyng that his name was Jesus, the said manne went to the maliciouse
and slanderous Jews, and told them how it was Jesus whom he might thank
for his health, thinkyng that it should be profitable for many, to have him
known to all men, which with a word could so help a desperate disease.
And here now again the Jews perverse and damnable frowardnes, shows it
self: for whereas the Samaritanes had honorably received Jesus, by the report
of one woman, whereas the people of Galilee being evil spoken of commonly
among the Jews, for their baseness and ignorance of the law, had given
credit to Christ: when a great ruler also being a gentile, and an heathen man
with all his family and householde for one only miracle had confessed Jesus
to be the savior of the world, yet the citizens of Jerusalem being proud as
well of the nobleness of their city, as also of the wholly religion of their
temple, and in likewise auauntyng themselves to be men exactely learned in
the law, picked quarrels to Jesus, Because he does these things on the
sabbath day.
of such purposed malice, that albeit the benefit of health was so evident
that it could not be denayed, and so holy that it could not be found fault
with, (for what thing is more holy then freely to give health of body to a man miserablye afflicted?) yet do they lay to Christ's charge as a fault,
that without regard of the Sabbath day he has commanded him to carye away
his couche, as who say man had be made for the Sabbath day, and not rather
the Sabbath day ordained for manne, or as though the ceremonies of Moses law
ought not every where to give place to more holy precepts and duties. But
what great blyndnes was this, to disdain Jesus because he had healed a
piteouse creature upon the Sabbath day? when they which thought themselves
most precyse kepers and obseruers of the law, were not afraid to help up
their ass being fallen into the ditche upon the Sabbath day. They falsely say
that in helpyng the manne, God was offended, without whose help the man could
not be cured, but in helpyng up the ass they thought not the religion of the
Sabbath day be bro^^n. This is the overthwart and disordered religion of the
Jews, imbracyng outward apparaunce of religion, and thereby subuertyng the
very perfeccion of true religion: styffely observing the shadows of the law,
and with obstinate minds persecutyng him who was the cause that the law was
written. For they did not only slander Jesus but also persecuted him, because
he had done an holy and good deed upon the Sabbath day.

But Jesus, to show that he was master of the Sabbath day and not bond, the
very auctor, and not subject to it, therewithal declares that the thing
whereof the Jews slaundred him, being son to the father of heaven, and one
that did work whatsoever he did by his fathers authority, did also redounde
to his fathers dishonor: Jesus (I say) went about to repress and put away
the Jews false report of him with these words. My heavenly father (says
he) whose religiouse wurshippers ye would seem to be, who also made the
sabbath day for you, when after he had made the whole world in six days, he
rested the seventh day and wroughte not: he (I say) did not so bind himself
to rest and quiet, but that he may work whatsoever he will as often as it
pleases him. For although the sabbath day does yet still endure,
nevertheless he ceasseth not from his work whereby he governs all things
which he has made, whereby also he causes from time to time by procreacion,
one thing to succeed of another: and finally whereby he restores things
decayed. Therefore like as he does not cease daily to do good both to men and
all other things that he has create (notwithstanding the religion and
obseruaunce of the Sabbath day, wherein as scripture says, he ceased from the
creacion of things) so I, who am his son, having both power and exaumple of
him to work such things as pertains to man's salvation, am not let by
the religious obseruacion of the Sabbath day, but I may perform those
things which my father has commanded me. But if ye blame me for breaking of
the Sabbath day, by the same means ye condemn also my father, who gives me
both exaumple and authority to do these things. But if ye think him
faultlesse and glorify him for restoryng health to a desperate creature:
wherefore do ye lay to my charge the fault of breaking the Sabbath day? and do
not rather acknowledge the virtue and power which is greater than the keeping
of the Sabbath day. I have restored life to a miserable man. And you craftily
go about to procure my death for doing so good a deed. Therefore the Jews
sought the more to kill him.
These most sacred words which Jesus spoke, did so little assuage the fury of
the Jews, that they were thereby the more sharpened and vehemently styred
against him, sekyng occasion to put him to death, because that now he did
not only break the Sabbath day, but also did (as they said) wrongfullye take
god to be his own father: making himself equal with god both in his works
and authority to do whatsoever he would.

himself does, and he will show him greater works then these, because you
should marvel. ^or likewise as the father rayseth up the dead and quickens
them, even so the son quickens whom he will. Neither judges the father any
man, but has committed all judgment unto the son, because that all men
should honor the son, even as they honor the father. He that honors not
the son, the same honors not the father, which has sent him. But after
our Lord Jesus had perceived their malice, he proceeds further with them, and
opens more manifestely unto them his power which he had received of God the
father: thereby to make them afearde to proceed in their wicked cruelty: and
does so tempre his communicacio^, that otherwhiles he talks of certain hye
things, to signify unto the^ covertly his divine nature which was all one
between God the father and him: And otherwhiles again in his communicacion he
brings in lower things, to testify his ma^hed thereby: that it the affinity
which was between him and them in that he was man, would not stir them to
love, at the least the majesty of his godly power should let them from their
wicked rashenesse: but yet he does so challenge to himself like power with his
father, that nevertheless he attributes to him the preeminence of authority.
And he spoke on this wise: Ye marvel that I have taken upon me to be of
equal power with my father in his workyng. This I do assuredly promise you,
the son which does wholly depe^de of the father can do nothing of himself:
forasmuch as he is not of himself, but does that which he sees his father
do. The son can do nothing of himself. etc
They have both one will and one power: but the authority rests in the
father, from whence proceeds to the son whatsoever the son is, or may do.
Therefore whatsoever ye father does, the same in likewise works the son by
the equality of power communicate to him through his eternal nativity. Among
men oftentimes children be unlike in manners to their parents, neither is the
fathers will and the sons all one, nor yet their power like: but in this case
the thing is far otherwise. For the father loves the son. etc
For the father loves his son intierly, and has begotten him most like to
himself, pouryng into him egall power of workyng, and shows unto the son
how to do all things which he does himself. The exaumple cummeth from
him, but the workyng is common to both: he has create the world, and he also
governs the world, yea even upon the Sabbath days. He has made man, and it
is he also that preserves man upon the Sabbath days. Therefore whosoever does
slaundre the works of the son, does injury to the father. These things
which ye see me do on the Sabbath day, I do them by the fathers authority,
and at his appointment: but if ye think it a thing to be merueyled at and
above man's power, to restore health with a word to a man sick of the palsy,
the father (at whose commandment the son does all things which he does)
will declare that he has showed to his son greater works than these,
because ye may she more marvel. For it is a thing of far greater power to
raise the dead to life, than to restore health to the sick, yet the father has
given this power also to the son, and he has given him it as his own for
ever: that as the father with his only beck rayseth the dead and calls them
again to life, so the son also by that self power may call again to life,
whom he lust: for whatsoever the father does, he does it by the son:
whatsoever the son does, he does it after the will of the father: and the
father and the son have both one will, like as they have both one power. The
most hye and chief authority of God is to judge the world. For he is king and
Lord of all things. And yet has he made his son partaker with him of this
whole power, Neither judges the father any man.
unto whom he has given al power to judge whatsoever is in heaven, in earth
and under the earth. Like as the father has create all things by his son,
governs al things by his son, and has restored al things by his son,
so he judges nothing but by his son: to the intent that either of the^ may
glorify and honor the other. The father is known by his son, by whom he
works: He that honors not the son. etc.
the son on the other party declares the majesty of his father, from
whence he has whatsoever he works: so that either of them being known by
the other, all men may honor the son as they do the father. For it is mete
that they which be egall in power and will, should be also fellows in honor.
Think not that ye can have the father merciful unto you, if ye be alienate
and fallen from the son. Whosoever honoreth the father working in the son,
he honoreth also the son working by the power of the father. And whosoever
does not honor the son, which is most intierly beloved and most like to
the father, that person does dishonor the father who sent the son to
the intent he might through him be honored: for every thing is common between
them, be it honor or dishonor. He that mistrusteth the son, mistrusteth
also the father which sent him into the world, by whose will and appoyntmente,
he does all things that he does: and by whom also the father speaks unto
the world. Like as the faithful shall have great reward, so the unfaithful
shall have no small punishmente.

For this I tell you for certain, whosoever hears my word and believes him
which both sent me, and speaks in me, that person has already everlasting
life. For whosoever is justified from his sins, and lives to God through
righteousness, he has God and also life eternal: neither shall he need to
fear the damnacion of eternal death, which is ready to receive the
unfaithful, yea rather which does already possess the unfaithful, but the
true beleuer being cleansed from his old sin by faith, passes through from
death to life. For it is a greater thing to raise a soul that is dead by
sin, from death to life, than to restore a dead body to life: but the father
has given power to the son to do both these things.

Be ye well assured of this, the time is now at hand, yea it is already
present, that even the dead also shall hear the voice of the son of God:
and whosoever hears it, shall live: for they being as it were raised out of their
sleep shall come forth out of their graves, and shall declare unto you (being
astonished therewith) that they live in very deed. In like manner also ye dead
souls do live again, if they will hear the voice of the son of God: but
he does not hear it, which hears it without faith.

In time to come all dead bodies shall rise again at the voice of the son of
God, The time shall come and now it is. etc.
now having showed a likelyhoode of the resurreccion to come by raising of a
few from death to life: a greater matter is in hand, to raise up souls from
death to life at his word and call. As nothing is more preciouse than life, so
nothing is more godlike than to give life, or to restore the same. There is no
cause why any man should mistrust the power of the son, For as the father
has life in himself. etc.
if he believe in the power of the father. No man doubts but God is the
fountain of all life, from whence all l^uing things either in heaven or
earth, have their life: but as the father has life in himself to give it or
restore it to whom he list, so has he also given to his son to have in
himself ye fountain of all life. And besides that, has given him power to
judge both quick and dead. For by the sentence of the said son, Maruail^
not at this. etc.
which cannot be exchewed, they that have o^eyed his doctrine, shall go from
hence to eternal life: and contrary, they that would not obey it, shall be
appointed and judged to eternal punishment. Marvel not that so great power
is given to a man, considering that the same is the son of God. The self
thing is now committed to him, which he always had common between him and the
father. Endeavor your selves in the mean time that through faith ye may be
wurthy to have life. For the time shall come that all which be dead and buried,
shall hear the almighty voice of the son of God: and furthwith the bodies
shall live again. Then shall they which have been dead and buried, come out of
their graves, to be rewarded in sundry sort, either according to their belief
or unbelief: for they which have done good works in this life shall than
live again, to enherite immortal life: on the other side, those which have
done evil here, shall live again to suffer pains of eternal death. And like
as faith is the well and fountain of all goodness, so is infidelity the spryng
of all evil.

Neither is there cause why any man should slaundre the judgment of the son
as though it were not indifferent. If the fathers judgment cannot be but
indifferent no more can the sons judgment (which is all one with the
fathers) be but in like manner indifferent. For the son judges none otherwise
but as the father has appointed and prescribed unto him. Whosoever fears the
fathers judgment, I can of mine own self do nothing.
ought also to fear the sons judgment. I can do nothing of my self. As I
hear of my father, so I judge, and therefore my judgment is just, because I
have no other will* but that which is my fathers, so that in no wise there can
be a corrupt will, whereof may proceed a corrupt judgment. Among men small
credit is given to him which bears witness of himself, and he is counted
arrogant and proud which by his own report, attributes great things to
himself. If I alone be mine own witness, then let my witness be taken among you
to be but vain and untrue: if I should bea^e witness of my self.
but there is one which has borne witness of me, that is to say John, to whom
ye do attribute very much in other things: but here now as unsteadfast men,
ye do no^ credit him, whereas I know his witness to be true, forasmuch as he
has not uttered it of himself, but by the inspiracion of my father.

Ye cannot deny but that John's record and witness is much set by among you:
your selves have sent grave men unto him, that by trusty men you might know
of him (as of a most true auctor) whether he were Messiah or no. He did not
take upon him that false praise, which ye would have attributed unto him, but
confessed the truth, openly testifying himself not to be the manne that he was
taken for* but said that I was the Messiah which should take away the
sins of the world, and give life to the same.

At the least his witness (whom ye did so much exteeme, that ye did believe him
to be Messiah) ought to have been regarded among you, specially seeing it was
not procured on my behalf, But I receive not the record of man. etc.
but brought to light by your own selves. I as concerning my self have no
need to be commended by man's witness, but I do report unto you Ihons witness
of me: not because I (who care nothing for worldly glory) would be the more
made of among you: but to the intent that you, which so much regard John's
authority, should credit me, of whom he has borne witness: whereby ye may
exchewe the condemnacion of infidelity, He was a burning and a shynyng light.
and through faith obtain salvation. John doubtless was a great man, yet was
not he that light which was promised to the world, but only a burning candell
tynded at our fire, and geuyng light by our light. And yet whereas ye ought at
his tellyng and declaracion to have made have to ye true light which does
alwaie illuminate every man that cummeth into this world, ye had leauer for a
short time to boast and glory in his light, than to embrace the true light
which gives everlasting glory, and is never darkened nor dies. John gave
light before the son, as one that should immediatelye give place to the same,
and be derkened through the shining of the true light. You would have taken
him for Messiah, which denied himself to be worthy to vnleuse the latchet of
Messiah shoes. Why do you then so little regard his witness that he bare of
me, But I have greater witness the^ the witness of John.
seeing in other things ye have had so good an opinion of him? I do not depend
upon John's witness, but yet I would wish that ye would give credit unto it,
that ye do not perish through infidelity. And though ye do not believe his
witness, yet have I a more certain testimonye of my self, that is to say my
fathers testimony and witness, who is greater than John, and whose witness
cannot be reproved.

There is no record more sure than the very deeds that a man does: if ye do
perceive those works to be worthy for God which ye have seen me doo^, for the
works which my father has given me to finishe. etc.
they bear sufficient witness of me that I do nothing of my self, but by
him which for your salvation has sent me into the world, wherefore ye have
no cause whereby to excuse your infidelity, and diminishe my credence, as who
says I alonely were mine own witness, and did declare great things of my
self. Ye have John's witness, which among you is much regarded and taken to be
very weighty, howbeit in deed he rather needs my witness les^e he seem to
have borne false witness. Ye have the testimony of my works, so that now ye
need not to believe any man's sayings when ye look upon the deeds themself.
And if all this do not satisfy your unbelief, yet have ye heard at Iordane
the voice of my father from above bearing witness of me. But yet my father
(forasmuch as he is a spirit,) neither has voice which may be perceived
with man's ears, nor form or shape that may be seen with bodily iyes. For
Moses did neither hear him, nor see him in the veraye form of his own mere
nature, as you suppose he did. Only his son has seen him, and heard him
after that sort* yet nevertheless he has made himself known to your senses,
Ye have not heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape.
by some kind of voice, and through some manner of form. He spoke to the
Prophets, and by the Prophets has spoken to you. He has spoken to John, and
by John to you, but unto me he has spoken as he is of his own very nature,
and by me he speaks unto you. If ye can make no excuse but that John did
bear plain and manifest witness, why do ye not believe him? If ye think that
God in very deed did speak, and was seen of Moses and the Prophets, wherefore
do ye not credit those things which he has spoken by them?

Uerely ye believe that the scriptures are come from God: and albeit you do
diligentely occupy your selves in searchyng of them, and put the ^ope and
felicity of your life in them, yet even as ye would not believe John, (to whom
in other things ye gave very great credit,) when he bare witness of me: so you
believe not the very scriptures in that which is the chief point of all: for
they promise life, but through me.

The father does there bear witnesses of me, and promises that he will send
his son, by whom men shall be saved. But as ye have heard John and not
believed him, and also the voice of the father and not given credit unto it: so
neither the witness of the law nor of the Prophets sticks in your minds.
And although ye have their books ever in your hands, and their words always
in your mouths, yet do ye reiecte him whom those sc^iptures do promise:
and do not believe him whom the father has sent according to the promyses of
the Prophets: and whereas there is none other entry into life but by me, who
has been approved to you by so many testimonies, yet ye will not forsake all
thing and come to me, whereby ye may obtain life without difficulty. For the
gate and entry of salvation is to have believed the son who^ the father sent.
There is no cause why I should seek for worldly glory among you by the
testimony of John, or the Prophets, but I am sorry for your destruction,
which through your incredulity do in manner envy your own salvation. And
besides that I leave you no manner of excuse to make for your self, if you will
not believe: for I have brought forth thus many witnesses, which in other
things be of very great authority among you: and only in matters
concerning me (for whose cause all things were written and spoken,) ye do not
allow them: ye pretend to wurship and love God, ye have the prophets in
reverence by whom he spoke: and yet you do despise him, which was promised of
God: and does declare himself by his works what he is. This is a plain
argument that ye wurship God with counterfaicte holiness, and that ye love not
God in deed, whom the law commands you to love with all the power of your
soul, and your strength, inasmuche as ye contemn and regard not his son.
Therefore your infidelity is not for want of witnesses, but for lack of true
love toward God. You love worldly glory, you love money* you love pleasures,
and to get these things you misuse your selves with false pretense of
religion. But ye persecute the son of God: because he teaches those things,
which be contrary to these your wicked desires, albeit his reachyng agrees
with the will of the father. Ye have not the love of god.
These things declare that ye love not god with your heart. For he which
loves does also believe and obey: and whosoever loves the father cannot hate his
most entierly beloved son. In like manner he that loves the sender, cannot
mislyke and contemn the messanger specially considering I covet neither glory,
kingdom, nor richesse among me^, but only the glory of my father. And also I
covet that, to thentent you may be saved. You see works wurthy for God, and
yet I do not ascribe the worldly praise to my self, but to my father, who
works by me. Therefore although ye would ^eme religiously to wurship my
father: yet ye do not receive me who am come in his name, and do none other
thing but that which he has prescribed unto me. And look how peruersely you
do discredit me, who cummyng in my fathers name do freely offer life and
salvation: even so fondely shall ye believe whosoever cummeth in his own name,
presumpteously taking upon him the glory of God, and therewith attends his
own business and not Gods, bringyng such thyng^s unto you as may lead you
into eternal death. If ye love God, why do ye murmr and cry out against him
that seeks his glory? If ye love everlasting life, why do ye reiecte the
autour of life? If ye account him wicked which chalengeth the glory of God to
himself, wherefore then do ye receive him which does presume fal^^y to take
upon him the glory of God? what is then more to be said, but that ye must
needs confess your holiness toward God to be but feigned? ye wurship God with
words, with outward abseruaunces, and ceremonies, but ye hate him in very
deed: ye have always in your mouth, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the
Lord, the temple of the Lord, but your h^rte is set upon richesse. Ye talk
much of the law and the Prophets, but in your heart ye covet and desire
worldly praise: you be ever speaking of these words of the law, love thy
Lord God with all thy heart, and thy neighbor as thyselfe, but in your heart
remains envy, hatred, and manslaughter. To deserve praise before God is the
true praise in deed. True godlynes is to give and ascribe all glory to god.
Therefore how can ye believe me setting fueth to you none other thing but gods
glory, when you despisyng the true glory which proceeds from god, go about to
seek false glory and praise amongst men, one of you flatteryng another, and
envying that God should have his own due praise and glory? sekyng also under
a false pretense, to be thought holy before men, and not regardyng the sincere
and pure conscience which God beholds, whiles ye travail to get the vile
lucre of this world, ye lose eternal life. Therefore it is no meruail though
God be angry with you whom ye resist so stubbernely. Think not that I, or
any desire to revenge the contempt ye have me in, will accuse you to my
father. I need not to be your accuser. Moses himself shall accuse you, whose
authority you amongeste you take to be right holy, and in who^ ye put very
great trust, taking whatsoever he wrote as a thing spoken of Gods own mouth.
But as ye pretended but a feigned reverence toward John, whose witness
concerning me ye do not believe, and as ye do show your selfs to regard the
sayings of the Prophets but feynedly, in that ye do now persecute him,
whom they have promised, finally as ye do untruly wurship god, whose works
ye do not acknowlage, whose son ye do hate: So ye do honor Moses but
after a feined sort, whose authority ye set little by in yt thing, wherein ye
ought most to regard him. And yet even veraye he has written of me, for when
your elders being agreued with the terrible voice of God, and with the
perilous fire, made intercession that from thencefoorth they might no more
hear the voice of God, or prove that dreadful fire, God did grant their
request, and promised Moses that he would raise an excellent Prophet like
unto himself, which should cumme of your brethren, whose gentle and pleasant
voice not fearyng men with threatenyng, but alluryng them to salvation, it
should behoue the^ to hear. But God did threaten punishment to him that
would not obey this Prophets words, saying: Truly I will be revenged of him
which will not hear the words that he shall speak in my name. And again he
commands him to be destroyed which will hear a Prophet cummyng in his
own name, and speaking such things as God has not commanded him.

Therefore none other shall more accuse you before god, than Moses your friend,
whose writings ye contemn: he has promised that I should be quiet,
gentle, and should speak all things according to Gods will. Such a one am I
being here present, and yet ye refuse me: he also commands that person to
be killed, which shall cum in his own name and speak of his own spirit. Such
a one do you embrace and make much of, for the hatred ye bear to me, as one
that is more agreeable to your wicked desires. Therefore you be not only
stubberne against me, but also against Moses himself, whose promyses you do
not credit. For truly if ye believed Moses, ye would credit me also, whom he
has promised, and whose saying he has commanded to be believed. Therefore it
is no marvel though ye believe not my words whom ye do openly contemn as
one that is but a mean simple person, when ye give no credit to Moses
writings, whose authority ye would seem to have in so great estimacion, and
of whom ye have so notable an opinion. With these sayings our Lord Jesus
being the light and truth, did reprove and disclose the feyned religion of the
Jews, a thing as much contrary to the godliness of the gospel as may be,
to the intent he would make it evidently known to all men, that they through
their own fault and defecte did perish, which would not be moved with so
many records and testimonies of him, nor be allured by his benefits and
gentle words, nor feared with his threatenynges, neither provoked to faith by
the desire of eternal life, nor yet turn from their infidelity for fear of
hell. But if Jesus had spoken these things among the Samaritanes or the
Gentiles, specially causing his words the better to be believed through
miracles, they would have been converted to penance. But the Scrib^s and
Priests of Jerusalem make no answer to these things which they could not
reprove: but yet nevertheless they do still remain in their murderouse
thoughts: and procure his death, which offreth to them the benefits of
eternal life.

The.vi. Chapter.

Now therefore, to give place for a time to their fury, and to withdraw
himself from amongst those that swelled in pride through an opinion they
had in their false feyned religion, and in their vnexperte knoweledge of the
law, Jesus presented himself to more plain meaning men: going not now again
into Cana, but into that Galile which lies beyond the great lake Tiberias,
taking that name of the city Tyberias, which city Tiberius the Emperor
builded upon that ryuers side. And a great noumbre of folk followed him going
thither partly being moved so to do of the great mind they had to his
miracles, because they had seen him healpe men of their diseases by a rare
and strange power, partelye because that they which were sick of incurable
diseases might be helped of him, and partly for that they desired to hear
his doctrine. But when he saw the feruencie of that disordred and confused
multitude to be so great, that forgettyng provision of vitels, they went
far into the deserte with him: now to make his disciples mete for the miracle
(to whom most specially he would have the thing that he should work to be
known and imprinted in their hertes, for as yet they were but rude and
ignoraunte:) Jesus I say, got himself secretlye up into the mountain, and
his disciples with him: teaching even by the same deed, that albeit he which
professes himself to be a shepeheard of the people, do accumpany himself
often with the mean and low sort to profit them, yet it behooves such a
one to eleuate and lift up his mind to more high things, so often as through
holy study or prays his mind is to be stirred and provoked to the
contemplacion of heavenly things. The people abides benethe upon the plain
ground, and only Jesus disciples went up with him, for it behoue the
bishops to be without all vile care of temporal things: and as men that
have mounted higher, to contemn those things which the ignoraunte people
sets much by.

Therefore Jesus being sumwhat separate from the people, sets him down on the
hill, accumpanied with his disciples: but so that he might look upon the
people: for bishops ought not to go back from Christ, although the common
people stick much to lower things.

And in deed above all in the hill is convenient for men to sit, that is to
say, in study of celestial things must men take rest, and as for lower
and inferior matters (which things are to be handled and gone about as
charity, and time requires) men must rather walk therein, then sit down
and rest. Nor our mind ought not so to be delited in the contemplacion of hye
things, that we fall to be careless of our common flock: for the solitariness
of bishops ought to be to this end, that they more liuelye and better
enstructed, might repair again to look to the peoples profit. Neither does
it beseme them which are in Christ's stead to leave coumpany for bankettyng,
wantonness of body, dicyng huntyng, or such like inordinate pleasures: but
through quietness to renew the mind (which before was much buisied and
weried with more low and mean buisinesse.) And to make the same by pure
desires, instant prayer, by holy study and devout communicacion, mete for the
office and ministry of the gospel. Moreover whylest these things were
dooen in Galile, Easter was at hand: A feast which the Jews kept verai
religiously. Wherefore if he had sought for to have been noted of their
religion, it had been more convenient for him now at this time, to have been at
Jerusalem, but to show sum likelihood that in time to cum their house should
be leaft desolate, after the Jews were once becum rebels against God through
incredulity, and also that after the holy gospel should be openly setfurth,
al their carnal wurshippyng of God should cease, and there finally the feast
of Easter to be most specially celebrate, whereas (worldly affeccions
renounced and put away) the mind should be brought unto the love of
celestial things: upon these consideracions (I say) Jesus had rather be
among the people of Galile in deserte solitarily, then at Jerusalem in the
temple.

Now then when Jesus had opened his iyes and looked upon the people,
perceiuyng the noumbre to be exceadyng great, he so prepared the minds of
his disciples toward true credence of the miracle, that first he would have
the lack of meat well marked and considered of them, and also that the
multitude which stood beneath in their sight was innumerable: besides this
that there was but very few loaves which they themselfes with their own
hands should take unto Jesus, and from him distribute the same among the
people. Finallye, how that there should be leafte many baskettes full of
broken meat, which the same disciples should gather together as fragmentes of
the feast: And all this would Jesus have them to consider, because they
should not be ignoraunte in the thing, neither afterward forget the same. For
he knew that as yet his disciples were but of small understanding and
forgetful. Whence shall we by bread that these may eat.
Therefore to prove what mind Philip was of, and little by little to make him
believe better the miracle, Jesus says unto him: where shall we bye bread
that this great noumbre of people may have sumwhat to eat? Our Lord Jesus
asked these things, not that he was ignorant what store of bread and other
vitels they had, but partelye (as was said even now) to cause his Apostles
more aduisedlye to considre the miracle: and partelye also yt all men might
know how without care of bodilye sustenau^ce the disciples were which
followed Christ, and how well contented with common and homely meat. But
Philip, as yet lookyng for no miracle, although he had seen Christ before
turn water into wine at the marriage, when he wayed well how little money they
had to succoure theymselfes withal, and further what a great multitude of
men there was, he answered: Sir, why speak you of bying bread? I assure you,
in case we bestow two hundred pence in bread, yet will it not be enough, I
mean for to satisfy these men, which by reason of long abstinence are very
much an hungered, it will not so relieve them that every one eating but a
little, may escape thereby the peril of famishyng.

When Philyp had spoken thus, Andrewe (brother to Simon Peter) being sumwhat
wyser, lifted up his mind some hope or a miracle. Howbeit as yet with no full
confidence, for he had seen the water turned into wine and therefore did not
altogether mistruste but that the loaves also might be multiplied, nevertheless
as he thought, none otherwise then after a moderate portion, so that of fewer
loaves, the less bread, and of mo loaves more bread should increase. Whereas
Jesus (of truth) had no need at all of any matter to make bread of, who
creates even of nothing what he will, and when he will. Andrewe therefore
said, here is a certain boy that has five barlye loaves and two fishes,
but what can so little do to so great a multitude, being already hungry?

When Jesus saw they perceived the lack of meat, and pondered what a
multitude there was, Jesus says, make the people sit down,
he entendyng to stiere up their minds to look for a miracle, commaund^d his
Apostles to see the people placed and set down upon the grass, whereof in
that place was great plentye. The disciples do not now answer again, and
say: what needs it to have them set down when we lack meat to set
before them? For that which we have in store will not suffice our selfs, but
simply they without more a do obeyed Jesus commandment, and caused the
people to sit down in order, as it were to a feast. The people also like
simple plain men, trusted well, and did obedientely as the Apostles badde them,
although they saw no provision of meat. There was that sat down almost five
thousand. Jesus therefore took the five barley loaves, And Jesus took the bread,
and when he (after his customable manner) had given thanks to the father, he
brake them, and so took them to his disciples to distribute the same unto the
people, then framyng and fashionyng them, that by this corporal similitude
they should enure theimselues to play well the shepeherdes: and being
ministers of the ghospel, to feed and norishe the souls of Christ's flock
with spiritual food. For he is that very bread, which came down from heaven,
to give eternal life to them that desirously eat thereof. This bread verily
do bishops bestow and ministre unto the people, but from no where else, then
out of Christ's hands, and not without rendryng thanks to the father of
heaven, of whom we must knowlage our selfs to have received whatsoever
apperteineth to the salvation of mankind.

And unto whom as to the very auctour, our Lord Jesus referred all notable
things which he did here in this world, monishyng us therewith by the way,
that in case we should have any ex^ellente virtue in us, we should not
challenge the praise thereof, but clerelye put from ourselves all the glory
of the same and give it unto God, from whom proceeds al things that of right
deserve praise.

Furthermore, Jesus did even here now the same thing by the two f^shes, that he
had before done by the five loaves, deliueryng it unto his disciples, and at
his will and pleasure, the meat did increase between the hands of the dealer of
it, so much in quantity as he knew would suffice them all, yea and also a
great deal more, to make the miracle the better to be believed.

Finally, when that great cumpany was well filled with meat, Jesus setting
forth the certainty of that deed by an other proof, lest any manne should
find fault and impute the thing to be a delusion or a countrefayte thing,
said thus to his disciples: Gather up the broken meat which is left of the
reaste, that nothing be lost. And they found so much broken meat after
every one had eaten his fylle, as filled twelve baskettes: The bountiful
goodness of Jesus augmented that scarcity and small store of vitayles (that is
to wete, of five loaves and two fishes) into this so great plentye, to teach
us by the way that we should not niggardlye do our charity unto the poor.
But by this his miracle much more he teaches how that it behooves him which
has taken upon him the charge to feed the flock of Christ, largely to
bestow out of the rich treasourye of holy scripture whatsoever apperteineth
to enstructe, to counsel, to coumforte and encourage them that needs such
food.

Moreover, when they which had eaten enough at full, were not ignorant how
there was at the first found out but five barleye loaves and two fishes, and
had already seen so many baskettes full of broken meat remain, they
begone highlye to report of Jesus, saying: Truly this is thatsame Prophet
which has long time been looked for, to cumme into the world. This is even
the nature of the common people, they do sooner feel the benefit of the
belly then of the mind. They had seen greater miracles, yet did they never g^ue
him so hye a praise. Plentye of meat could cause them speak thus.

And at this present, (because as yet they were ignoraunte and gross, lookyng
that Messiah should cum to get himself a worldelye kingdom) they did
consulte among theimselfes to take Jesus, and make him their king, well
assuryng theimselfes thereof, that in case they might have such a king, they
should have plentye of all things, vittayles enough, riches, liberty, and
other worldly commodities abundantly.

But Jesus which did covet an other manner of kingdom, and came to teach us
to contemn riches, pleasures, and worldely glory, knowing right well what
they intended and went about, did now again secretelye convey himself to
the hill (from whence he came down to the people.) From them that called him
to a kingdom, he withdrewe himself priuelye all alone, so that no man
could perceive his going away, but of his own free will he meteth them that
pulls him to the cross, therein geuyng a plain exaumple to them that
should hereafter be his deputies. For he can never preach the gospel
purelye, that loves a worldelye kingdom and pomp, which things spiritual
shepeherdes ought so little to seek for, that it behooves them to refuse those
things, though they be freelye given them. For the kingdom of the world
agrees not with the kingdom of heaven, no more v^rilye then darkness and
light accords.

When the disciples had long looked for their master in the hill, and euenyng
was now at hand, lest the dark night should cum upon them being in
deserte, they went down to the lake to row over unto the city Capernaum
(for Jesus had there a little place to repose himself in) well hopyng either
that he in sum other ship should mete them as they were sailyng over the
lake, or at the least they should find him in the city. And it was dark
already when they prepared their passage over: neither did Jesus in the mean
while cumme to his disciples, being long and much looked for of them, knowing
well enough how much they were agreued with his absence.

But Jesus mind was through his absence to make his disciples more desirous of
him, and therewyth also to teach in what great daungier we be in, what great
darkness, what worldely trouble hangs over us, as often as we be disseuered
from Jesus. In the mean while a matter was prepared for a greater miracle.

The lake was so great that they called it the sea, which the night made more
terrible. And to make it more ways dangerous then one, they had the winds
so outrageous against them, that the lake was exceadyng rough withal: yet
nevertheless the disciples were so desirous of their master, that they did
adventure to row upon the water. Now therefore, when they were far from the
land and had rowed upon a five and twenty, or thyrtie furlonges, being
almost in despair of their lives, our Lord Jesus was cumme nighe unto them
unlooked for: notwithstanding the darkness they se him going on foot upon
the sea, as though he had trodden upon the hard ground, to declare himself
thereby lord not only of the earth, but of all elements also. And of truth
the charity of the gospel has iyes and can see ^uen in the dark, neither
is there any night where Jesus is present, nor any deadly tempeste whereas
he is nygh, that makes all things clear and caulme. But now when our Lord
was cum nighe unto the ship: the disciples were suddenly aferde, and because
they could not well see and perfectly di^cerne in the dark, they now suspect
the thing to be but as it were a vision in the night, a ghost or such like as
the vulgar people believe many to be seen of them that sail by night.

Nevertheless, to put them out of all fear with speaking unto them in his
own propre voice (which they knew, and were well accustomed therewith) Jesus
said unto them: it is I, be not afraied, signyfiyng thereby that such as have
the assistence of our Lord Jesus, ought not to be afraid of worldly
trouble, be it never so great and necse. All they truly which in
simplicity and plainnes of heart do consta^tly and faythfullye depend upon
him, has him present even to the worlds end. Now the disciples being
boldened at the voice of their master, were desirous to take him into the
ship: for even they verily were sumwhat afraid, whose trust and hope yet
was both weak and unconstant. But to the intent that our Lord Jesus might
declare to his disciples the whole thing yt was done, to be wrought by his
divine power, and that the storm was not swaged and ceased by casualtye, the
ship which incontinentelye before was tossed hither and thither ^ far of
from the shore, did suddenly ariue to the land, whereunto they intended to
go. The disciples (whose faith was to be framed and confirmed by all the
ways that could be possible) by these proves and tokens did more
diligentelye imprinte in their minds this miracle.

And in deed the people were not altogether ignorant of this strange thing
and miracle, for the next day after these things were dooen when the
multitude which remained still on the other side of the water, saw that none
other ship was there, save that one wherein the disciples went over, whom
when they saw shootyng on the shore, they were well assured that Jesus went
not with his disciples into the ship, but that they went away alone: The
people (I say) meruailed to what place he had secretelye withdrawn himself,
for so much as not withstandyng the multitude whom he had fed the day before
did much desire and long for him, yet in the morning did he no where
appear: But yet supposyng that he would not be very long absente from his
disciples, which were already gone over, even these folks also were
determynyng to row over the water to prove if they could find him on the other
side. And there was present at the same time certain ships which had cum,
not from Capernaum, but from Tyberias, a c^tie also standing by the sea side,
^igh unto the place where they had been fed, and eaten their fill with.v.
barley loaves, wherewith being satisfied they gave thanks to god which had
sent to his people such a prophet. Therefore when these shyps were in a
readiness to carrye over the people, and Jesus that was much sought for,
could no where be found, the people took shippyng there to ^eke Jesus,
because he had there a restyng place, and because they also knew that the
Apostles were sailed over thither.

When they had found Jesus here, and saw that he had passed over the lake,
and knowing right well that there was no ship to conueigh him over, much
meruailyng by what means he could pass over the water, asked of him, saying:
Master when cameste thou hither? desiring to gather by the very time how he
had passed over: For they supposed even this thing also to be done by
miracle, like as he had the day past fed a vey great multitude. But the
feruencie which they had the day before, whereby the other day they went
about to force him to a kingdom even against his will, was now well cooled.
And lest Jesus should seem to auaunte his own power, he makes no answer to
these things: to the intent they should be mo^e crediblye enfourmed of the
miracle by his disciples, and also by euidente (...) thereof. But Jesus did
sore rebuke and earnestely reprove the affeccion of the multitude (as not only
vnconstaunte, but also rude and gross, and far unmeet for the doctrine of
the gospel,) because that albeit they had seen greatter miracles which
did more prove his divine power, yet nevertheless one plenteous diner did more
stir them, then the desire of eternal salvation. And they set more by
bodily susteinaunce (wherewith that thing is now and then and but for a time
releued, which within a while after shall perish) then they did hungre
after that meat, without which the soul do the everlastingly perish.

Finally, he did correct their gross judgment of him: whereby they
thought he did work his miracles, to the intent to deserve therewith, at the
rash peoples hand, a worldly kingdom: whereas Christ in veraye deed
(according as the time required) did show sum prou^e of his divine power by
certain miracles, for none other cause surely but that through sensyble and
bodilye things, he might cause more credit to be given unto his doctrine:
which promised those things that cannot be perceived with bodilye senses.
And by this way also to bring up those (that were yet rude and weak) by
certain degrees, to the capacity of more hye things: Like as a trusty
Master would wish, that (if it could be) his scholar should forthwith take
and understand his whole science, yet for a time he fourmeth and fashioneth
the rude and vnframed wit with certain pryncyples, until he have brought
him up to the perfect knowledge of his faculty, so that he shall after need
none of those introduccions. And though the teacher do not teach the veraye
letters and his first rules without werines, yet he does bear that
tediousness and wear it away with the hope of profityng his scholar,
labouryng all the ways he can, to get him soon out of those course
principles. Therefore Jesus to declare here also his godhead, in that he knew
their thoughts, when he saw the people had now again recourse unto him,
for the desire of such miracles which should rather fill the bellye then
instruct the mind: he took occasion of the meat that he had once given
them, to teach them what food they ought to have most desired. The effect
of his saying was this. Uerely this thing is true (says he) which I will
tell you: ye call me master, not because ye be much desirous of my doctrine
which is all spiritual, but because ye seek for worldelye pleasures and
small commodities, which are more esteemed of you then things which do
far excelle them. And at this present ye do seek me with great affeccion,
and yet (^wisse) not so much for to see miracles, which ought in deed to
allure you to mind celestial things, but yesterdayes there does more
provoke you, then that ye be enamoured of goddely power. And ye coumpte it a
great matter if a man feed your body without your charge. It is but a small
matter to feed this body, that otherwise must needs decay and be
destroyed: neither shall they that be desirous of the doctrine of the gospel,
lack meat. Therefore turn all your care to get that food, which where it
is taken, does not perish by disgestion, nor does prolong life of the
body for a short time, as the common material susteinaunce does, and yet
within a while hungre cummeth again* But get such food (I say) as
tarrieth still in man, noryshing the soul with spiritual food: Labor not
for ye meat which perishes
and gives eternal life thereunto. The son of man will give you this
excellent bread, if he perceive that you do long and hungre for it. For
certainly God willing to give eternal life to mankind, did specially
appoint this son of man, geuyng unto him power, and with miracles bringing
him to great estimacion, that he should give spiritual food to all that
desire eternal life. And also for this purpose he gave unto the same, power and
authority and with miracles brought him to great estimacion. For Jesus came
not into the world to get unto himself worldelye honor, or to make men
blessed with worldly commodities, but he came rather about this buisinesse,
that is to were, to lift up men from vile filthy cares, to care and study for
heavenly things.

When as the rude and ignorant people (minding altogether their belly)
understood not these things, no nor once considered them, they answered
Jesus on this wise. For so much as thou councelleste us to work a certain
meat, that should still remain in us, and bring with it everlasting life,
what shall we do therefore, that we may work those things which are mete
for God, and that we may deserve eternal life, for which causes you say
that you were sent into the world? Jesus being nothing offended with this so
gross an answer, proceeds by li^le and little to call them from their
fondness to more perfect things. If ye ask (says he) what is the work
whereby ye may deserve to have God, which is a spirit and is pleased with
spiritual things, This is the work of God that ye believe.
ye shall understand, that it is no sacrifisyng of beasts, no keepyng of the
Sabbath day, no outward washynges, no choice of meats, no relygion of
garments, nor other things which does consiste in corporal ceremonies:
but this is the work which God requires of you, to believe his son whom
he has sent, and by whom he speaks unto you: lest he should seem to
grant everlasting life to you that be unthankful persons, or rather unworthy
such a benefit. The people which challenged a wondrefull religion through
the obseruyng of Moses law, made now answer unto these things, not only
grossly, but also vnkyndelye and wickedlye, and say. If you take upon you a
special authority above our elders, whose authority we have hitherto
followed, what sign show y^ then?
show sum proof and lesson of thine authority given there of God: that upon
sight thereof we may believe not thy words but thy deeds. For it is no reason
that without sum woonderous sign we should believe the, which in words take
arrogantly upon the this authority. Neither would we rashelye have given
credence unto our forefathers, but that through a token which came from
Heaven, they did certifye us of their goddelye authority. Our auncetours
did eat Manna in the wilderness under Moses that was their guide. This was
of truethe the bread of God, an heavenly food which did not putrify, as
it is written in the Psalm: he gave them celestial bread to eat. Therefore
by reason of this woondrefull thing, the people then being moved, obeyed Moses.
And in case thou canste do the like or else sum greatter thing, we will also
believe the. Nor yet did this so gross, so unkind, so wicked an answer of the
people, make the gentleness of Jesus weary, from alluryng them to the knowledge
of spiritual things. For first of all they require sum strange token, as
though they had never seen any miracle before: neither be they content with
every kind of miracle, but as men that would gooe before him in all things,
they prescribe him what kind of miracle they would have him do: and to
conclude, amongst so many wonderful doings that are red to be done unto the
old ancient Jews, they pick out that chiefly which apperteineth to fedyng:
so much care had they of their belly.

Therefore Jesus as it were dissembleyng the ignorance of the people, thus
little by little brings them to the perceiuyng of spiritual things, saying:
If Moses authority be therefore weighty and regarded among you, because he
gave you Manna from heaven, and ye honor it as heavenly food because it came
down from heaven: God is most then to be thanked herein, from whom Manna did
flow, and to whom the glory and praise of al miracles is due. For neither
Moses could do this thing of himself (who was nothing else but gods ministre)
neither was that bread very heavenly bread in deed, although David that wrote
the Psalms call it bread of heaven: for it came not from very heaven, but it
rained down out of the air, like as birds living in the air are called
birds of heaven: and truly this Manna was but only a figure of the heavenly
bread. And even as god gave corporal bread to a carnal people by Moses, that
served him in the world: so now my father by his heavenly son gives unto
you, as to a spiritual people, that bread which undoubtedly came from heaven:
and does not only fill and saciate the bodies for a time, but gives
immortality of soul to them that will receive it. That was but material
bread, and gave life only to the body for a time, and how^ great a benefit
so ever it was, yet did it profit but the people of one nation alone: but the
bread that I speak of, is neither corporal, neither did it distyll out of the
air, but did proceed even from very god himself, and is of such efficacy,
that it gives life, not to bodies but to souls, and not to one sort of
people alone, but to ye whole world: As touching the autour thereof (in case ye
pass much thereupon) well, instead of Moses in whom ye much glory, ye have
God the very auctour of this gift: and for the servant of god, ye have
gods own son. And if ye regard the gift, there is as great diversity
between these, as is between the body and the soul, and as is between this
life which shall shortly ^ease, and everlasting life in heaven.

When the Jews had heard all these things, yet were not they for all that
lift up to the love of celestial things: but still dreamyng upon matte^s
touching the belly, said unto Jesus: Sir give us always this bread. They
loved the sacietie of meat better then health, and sought rather for a
plentiful geuer of meat and drink, then for a savior. Therefore, to take
from the^ their dream of corporal food, Jesus expresses more plainelye unto
them, that he did not speak of bread that is chewed with teeth, and which
being conveyed through the throat into the stomach, swageth bodilye hungre
for a season, but of heavenly bread, which is the word, of God. Therefore he
says: I am that bread the very geuer of eternal life. He that hungrely
lusts after this bread, and will cumme to me, and suffer it to have passage
into the bowelles of the soul by faith, shall not feel any grief of hungre,
that shall cum to him after he be once fullye satisfied, I am the bread of life
but it shall tarrye still and abide in him that has received it, unto eternal
life. And my word has in it a fountain of spiritual water: whereof the
soul drynketh by faith, and not the body: therefore he that believes in me,
shall not only be without hungre, but also without thirst eternally. This
bread is not received by gapyng of the mouth, but through belief of the
soul. And therefore I have spoken these things unto you, to let you know,
that thoroughe your own fault ye shall perish, in case ye do persiste and
continue in your infidelity. My father denies this bread to no man, and to
you of all men it has been first offered, notwithstanding ye care more for
the bread that shall utterly cum to naught* Ye have seen me do greatter things
then if I should feed you with Manna: and I promise unto you and things of
greatter felicity, and for all this ye believe me not.

And albeit ye do through unbelief loeth this bread, yet for all that my
father has not sent it into this world without cause. There shall be sum
folk to whom this bread shall bring everlasting life, although the whole
nation of the Jews shall reiecte gods son: and therefore be even wicked
toward god because they do contemn the said son, whom the father has
sent to save the whole world. For my father is God not only of the Jews, but
also of al Gentyles. I have nothing in deed of myself, but yet whatsoever my
father has given to me (what kind of people so ever it be of) the same shall
cum to me by faith, although it has nothing to do at all with Moses law. And
whosoever will cumme to me, him will I not reiecte, yea and would to God all
folk would cum unto me. For my fathers will is (as much as lies in him)
that all men should be saved by faith. And for as much as his will and mine
is all one, for this end therefore I descended from heaven: not to do what I
will, as it were disagreyng with my father, but to do my fathers will which
sent me: from whose will mine cannot dissente. And truly my fathers will that
sent me is this, For I am cum down from heaven
that what thing so ever he has through faith given unto me, no deal thereof
do pe^ishe, I being the preserver of the same, lest the world should
violently draw unto death that thing which my father has ordained to live.

Furthermore, although the body do dye by the course of man's nature, yet
do^eth the soul, which is the better part of man, remain still alive. And to
thintente also that the whole man should like through me, my father wyl^eth
this thing too, This is the will of him that sent me,
that in the last day I shall restore the dead body also to life. For this is my
fathers will that sent me, even by his soonne to give ^ternall life unto all
men: and that not through Moses law, but by faith of the gospel. The father
does nothing but by his son. And therefore he that does not acknowlage the
soonne, does not acknowlage the father: and whosoever resists the son, he
also resists the father. The father is invisible, but yet he is seen in his
son. Therefore whosoever sees the son, acknoweledgeth him, and believes his
words, the said soonne will not suffer him to perish, but although he be
dead in body, he will raise him again in the last day, according to his
fathers will, that he so may live wholly, both in body and soul, in the
presence of the soonne whom he gave credit unto. The father has given this
power unto the soonne, that he may restore even the dead unto life.

When Jesus had spoken these things, the people which hitherto thorough hope
of meat, could metely well away with his communicacion, now seeing that they
saw their hope of bodilye sustenaunce was taken away, they fell to quarellyng
with him, to malign against him. And also whom they (being sufficed with
eating) would have made king, him do they no we contemn as a vile person*
and lay arrogancy to his charge, not openly as yet, but murmuring among
theimselues, chieflye at that saying which of all others they ought to
embrace, that is to we^e: I am the liuelye bread which descended from heaven.
They most coueted and gaped for bodilye food, and with this saying, they
thought theimselues deluded and mocked, where as in deed a thing far more
excellent was offered them then they looked for.

Certes the infirmity of his man^ed offended them, which they only loo^^^
upon with bodily iyes, when as they might both of his doings and sayings
have seen the power of god in him, if they had had iyes of faith. Is not this
man (say they) Joseph the carpenters son, whose father and mother we know
well enough by sight: and to be but poor folks and of a very mean estate?
Furthermore how can he for shame say, that he came down out of heaven, when as
but of late time he was borne here in earth amongst us, a very man of men as
we be? Or what means he by tellyng us of an other father? And whiles they
were talkyng secretly one to an other of these things, Jesus (declaring
forthwith that men's very thoughts were not hid from his knowlage) did make more
plain, and also confirm that which he had spoken before, saying: there is no
cause why ye should murmr among your selfs at these things, which I have
spoken unto you. Your infidelity is the cause why my words stick not in
your minds. Ye se and se not, you hear and hear not, and whiles ye be
present yet are ye absent. Of truth whosoever cu^meth to me, shall obtain
eternal life, but by faith must men cum to me. And faith cummeth not at all
auentures, but it is had by the inspiracion of god the father: who like as he
draws unto him men's minds by his son, so by breathyng in faith secretly
into men's souls, he draws them to his son in such wise, that through the
operacion of both jointly together, men cum to them both. The father does not
give this so great a gift, but to them that be willing, and desirouse to have
it. And truly whosoever does with a ready will and godly diligence deserve to be
drawn of my father, he shall obtain everlasting life by me. For I (as I told
you) shall call to life again even him that is dead, when ye day shall cum,
wherein the felicity of the godly and the destruction of the wicked shall be
finished and fully concluded. He that believes me receives an excellent great
thing, but he ought to thank the father for it, without whom no man can
believe, and yet for all that they that in the mean season do not believe, can
not excuse their fault by saying that they were not drawn: For the father (so
much as lies in him) coueteth to draw all men. He that is not drawn is in
fault himself, because he wythdraweth himself from him that else would draw
him.

Things of this world are learned by man's endeavor and study. This
celestial philosophye is not understand; unless the secret inspiracion of the
father make man's hatte apt to be taught. Undoubtedlye this is that which
the prophets long ago did say should be, thus Propheciyng before hand: And
they shall be al taught of God.
And they shall be al taught of god. But the lusts of this world makes many
one vntowardes to be taught: which worldelye desires whiles they even droune
men in these earthlye things, they suffer them not to lift up their minds
to heavenly things. The gift is gods, but the endeavor is yours. I man
hears my words with bodily ears in vain, except he hear before the
secret voice of the father, which must inspire the mind with an insensyble
grace of faith. Therefore whosoever fashyon theymselfes to be apt to receive
this inspiracion, the father does thus draw them. And he only that is so
drawn, cummeth finally to me. For god is a spirit, and is neither heard nor
seen, but to them that be spiritual. And so to have seen and have heard
him, is salvation. Many shall see and hear the son to their peril and
danger, notwithstanding that ye do glory in that god was seen and heard to
Moses and to the prophets. There was never mortal manne that saw and hard
god, as he is in his own nature and substance, that thing is given to the
son of god alone, which only came from God, with whom he was evermore
before he came into this world. Therefore put clearly out of your minds the
vile cares of this corporal life, labouryng all that ye can, that through
earnest desire of things that be spiritually good, ye may attain life
everlasting. I would ye should forget that bread wherewith the body is
satisfied, and be ye desirous of that heavenly bread, which gives eternal
life. This bread is received by faith, and faith is to be obtained of god the
father: be ye well assured thereof, that whosoever has affiaunce in me,
the same has already eternal life for so much as he has the fountain of
immortality.

I am that very bread which gives not a bodily and a transitorye life, but
the life of the soul, and eternal life. Although ye have me present, yet
nevertheless ye desire Manna, as a woondrefull thing. And albeit Manna (which
your ancestors did eat and feed upon for a certain time in the
wilderness) did cum from heaven (as you suppose) yet it did them no ferther
pleasure then wheaten or barlye bread would have dooen. It put away for a
while the hunger of the body, which shortelye after would return again,
and require more meat: but it could not give them immortality. For though
your forefathers were never so happy, yet did as many of them dye as did
feed of that Manna. This bread (which I speak of) descended out of heaven
in veraye deed, I am the living bread.
and it has received of god celestial strength to make him that eats of
it, to live in body and soul euerlastynglye, and never to be subject unto
death. Ye need not therefore ask importunately any Manna from heaven, when
as ye have very heavenly bread present and ready prepared for you, which
gives eternal life, in case ye will receive it by faith. For I my self am
that bread, the grau^ter of immortal life, who alone came down from heaven,
whom you (being offended with the infirmity of this body) take and think
to be nothing else but the son of Joseph and Marye.

Truly I am the very word of god the father, which whosoever believes shall
have immortal life. If any man will conueye and digeste this heavenly bread
into the inward parts of the soul, he shall be quickened and grow into
eternal life. And if you being but carnal do not yet understand spiritual
things, I will show you a more a plain and grosser matter, and a thing that is
more apperteinyng unto the flesh. Even this flesh which you see and look
upon, and which I shall bestow and give unto death for to redeem the life of
the whole world, is the living bread. Believe, eat it, and live. By this
sayyng our Lord Jesus did sumwhat (after an obscure sort) open unto them the
mystery of his godhed, whereby he was always with God the father, and of his
death also: by the which he should deliver and sauethe world from the
tyranny of death. Finallye he did insinuate herein unto them, the priuitie of
his mystical body: whereof he that is not a membre and by faith annexed
thereunto, and so still cleave and stick fast unto it as the branche does
cleave unto the vine, he shall not have life in him. And Jesus knew well
enough that at that time the Jews did not understand his sayings, but yet
for all that he was assured that in time to cum it should cum to pass, how
that these seeds (and as ye would say norishmentes of misteryes) being shut
and closed up within the minds of good men, should grow up and bring forth
plenteouse fruit.

Therefore when as these things seemed to them very inco^uenient and to folish
to be spokeoke^, and durst not talk homely and familiarly with y^e lord
himself, there arose a great discord in opinions among them, diverse of them
diversely interpretyng the thing yt was spoken. For even as Nicodemus understood
not Jesus when he spoke of a new heavenly birth, nor the woman of Samaria
knew what Jesus meant in his dark speaking of the water that should flow into
everlasting life: so this rude and gross people co^te^ded how it could be
brought to pass, that a man should give his flesh to be eaten of other: and
that in such sort as it should suffyse al men to perpetual life. For he did
bid, and invited all me^ to eat heavenly bread, and said moreover that his
flesh was bread. How shall we (say they) eat the flesh of a living ma^ne? And
again, Jesus being not ignoraunte about what matter they contended, did not
declare unto them by what way and means that flesh might be eaten in stead of
bread, but here now confirms ye thing to be nedeful, and a very necessary
thing, which they judged but a vain thing and a plain absurdity, and that it
could not be done. Take this for a very suertye (says he) except ye receive
me whole, that is to say, unless ye eat the flesh of the son of man in
stead of bread, and in the place of wine drink his blood, ye shall not have
life in you. On the contrary side, whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my
blood, has by eating and drinking thereof eternal life. Neither shall the soul
alone live blessed and most happy by reason of this meat and drink, but also
after the resurreccion of the body, the whole man both body and soul shall
have with me the fruicion of everlasting life. Except ye eat ye flesh of the
son of man.
For like as man's natural meat being conveyed down into the stomach, and
after it be digested is conveyed thence throughout all the members of the
body, and so turnethe into the substance of the body, so that then the meat
and the man that eats it, is al one: in like manner on the othersyde, he that
has eaten me, shall be spirituallye transformed and turned into me.
Furthermore, forsomuche as I am the chief auctour of the resurreccion I will not
suffer my members to be disseueted and pulled away from me: but whosoever is
surely joined to me by this meat and drink, I shall raise him up again in
the last day: that because the whole man having both body and soul believed
me, the whole man no we also may live with me euerlastynglye. Bodily meat
woorketh not this effect, neither yet Manna wherein ye rejoice, but the eating
of my body, and the drinkyng of my blood, brings this thing to pass. And
therefore my flesh is truly meat, which gives immortality, and my blood
is truly drink, which does procure eternal life, not only to ye body, but to
ye whole man both body and soul. And as the life of the body which is
nourished with daily sustenaunce, lest it should perish before the time, is
common to all the members of the body, by reason of the indivisible fellowship
that all the parts of the body has togetherwardes, in so much that though
the members of the body be diverse and sundry, yet there is but one body,
because that one soul gives life to every part of the body: so he that
eats my flesh, and drynketh my blood, is in such sort coupled and joined
to me, that neither can I be separate from him, nor he from me. For I am in him
by my spirit, by who^ I will give life to him. And he is in me as a membre in
the body, and as the branch is in the vine, by such a participacion as
cannot be dissolved.

The father that sent me is the principal fountain of al life. Whosoever is
joined to him, is made partaker of life. And therefore as the father is in me,
and gives me life, and also power to give life unto other: even likewise to
him that eats me (and is so annexed to me, by reason of that mystical
eating, and drinkyng, that he is made one with with me) do I give life, not to
endure for a short time, but eternal life. What thing soever is of earthly
nature, the same does continue but for a time, and is of small efficacy.
Manna which stylled down from heaven for you, then being under Moses tuicion
and conductyng, because it was food pertainyng to the body, it could not
give eternal life to your elders: for whereas all men did eat thereof, they
nevertheless dyed, neither did any one of so great a number remain vndead: yea
more part of the^ died also in soul, because they provoked god many ways, to
wrath. But certes this bread, that undoubtedly came down from heaven, has a
celestial virtue in it and gives eternal life to the eater thereof. The
Lord Jesus did instruct the ignorant and gross multitude with such words:
This is the bread which came down from heaven. etc.
very desirous to stir them up from the love of vysible and corporal things,
to the love and desire of heavenly and eternal things. And he spoke these
words in the Sinagogue amongst a great assembly of people exercising the
office of a teacher. Howebeit the gross people was so far of from the
capacitye of these heavenly mystiries, that a great sort of his disciples
also being offended herewith, were about to fall from their master, murmuryng
amongst themselfes and whisperyng this saying: This is an hard cruel saying
(say they) concerning the eating of a living man's flesh, and drinkyng his
blood: whose ears can abide to hear such doctrine?

Jesus, understanding what they murmured at secretly among themselfes, labored
to remedy the thing that they were offended with, giving knowledge beforehand
unto them that they should see greater things with their iyes then that they
heard him at this time speak of himself. And he showed them that the words
which he had spoken as touching the eating of his flesh, and to drink his
blood, was no inco^uenie^t thing, nor to be abhorred, but a right pleasant,
graciouse and fruitful saying: in case it were taken and understand not after
their course and gross intelligence, but after a spiritual sense. Now
therefore being turned toward his disciples, whom it had behooved to have
further considered, and to have been wyser then the base sort of people, by
reason of the acquaintance and familiarity which they had with Jesus, and
also for the miracles which they had seen him work: Jesus (I say) loking upon
his disciples, rebuked their dulnes in this wise, saying: Does it offend your
ears to hear me say that I am the bread which came out of heaven, to give
life to the world? whether is it a greater difficulty (after the gross
understanding of man's wit) to have descended from heaven, or to ascend up
into heaven? What then, if hereafter ye do see the son of man, whom ye now
see to have the natural body of a man, ascend into heaven, where he was before
he came down thence, and before he had this mortal body? This is done and
granted by reason of your senses: not that ye should be always carnal and
understand all things fleshly, but that ye should leave the flesh, and go
forward to the spirit. The spirit descended from heaven, and was incarnate
the flesh being now made spiritual, shall be carried away up into heaven,
lest ye should all way love the flesh, and be carnal, but yet being first
instructed by the flesh, ye ought to profit and go forward toward heavenly
things. For the flesh alone and of himself, profits nothing, it is the
spirit that gives life. For what is bodily substance of men, if the spirit
lack? even so my word carnally understand, What and if ye shall see the son
of man etc.
shall not give life unless ye take it as an heavenly thing, and understand it
spiritually. By my flesh and blood, I mean my doctrine, and so I term it,
which doctrine if ye do by true faith receive it desyrously; and effectuously,
and than conueigh it into the bowels of your mind, and retain it there, it
will quicken and make your minds lively, and cause you and me to be al one: so
that ye shall through my spirit, live everlastingly: like as the members of one
body lives by one common spirit, so long as they do adhere and cleave fast
together. And I shall leave unto you my flesh and blood as a hid secret
mystery, and mistical token of this copulacion and fellowship: which self thing
although ye do receive it, yet will it not profit you unless ye receive it
spiritually. Therefore do not repugne and refuse my saying (though being still
carnal ye do not rightly understand it, nor take it as it ought to be taken)
but rather labor for the true understanding thereof. For the words which I
have spoken unto you, are not carnal (as you interpretate them) but be
spirit, and life: and why: Uerely because they being spiritually understand,
do confer and give life to the soul. He that receives these words rightly
and truly, eats my flesh, and drinks my blood: and being coupled to me,
gayneth thereby everlasting life. But he that willingly refuses them
continues in death, thorough the sins of his former life, and doubleth his
own damnacion of eternal death, by reason of infidelity. And all they refuse
this bread when it is offered them, which believe not my words. And I know
that these things are spoken al in vain to sum folks: being right well
assured that there be sum among you which does not credit my words, and
therefore reiectyng life when it is offered them, they be cause of their own
utter destruction.

And for that cause our Lord Jesus spoke these things, who was ignorant in
nothing, yet he knew well enough or ever he spoke these words, which of his
disciples would give faith unto him. And moreover he could tell this also:
that even amongst the twelve Apostles, (whom he so surnamed for honor sake)
and whom he did also choose specially to be about himself, as most sure
friends: He knew (I say) that there should be one of them which would
betraye him to the Jews, that should put him to death. Therefore, to note
them, which though they did hear all one word and saying with the rest,
and though also one of the twelve should eat of the same bread and drink of
the same cup, which his fellows should eat and drink of, yet should not
they obtain life thereby, because they took and received that heavenly bread
not spirituallye, but carnally, Jesus added more, and said: for this cause I
told you a little before, that no man could cum unto me, except it were given
him so to do from heaven of my father. To have heard this my voice, is nothing:
to have seen and felt this body, is nothing, except the father of heaven have
given withal, the iyes of faith: with the which I am looked upon to the
beholders health, and unless he shall give therewith heavenly ears of the mind,
with the which I am heard fruitefully, and to the hearers commodity.

These words of Jesus being full of the doctrine of salvation, did not
descend down into their minds, whose minds were occupied with earthly
desires and covetousness: who also understood no heavenly things, besides the
gross and carnal religion (as they used it) of Moses law. Therefore after
that Jesus had this communicacion among them, the more part not only of the
common people, but also of his own disciples, fell away from their master,
and thereby are made wurse, whereby they might have been much better, in case
they had taken all things well, and received him accordynglye, and they so
much forsook him, that they withdrewe themselfes from his cumpany, and from
eating and drinking with him, as men that by that fact would condemn his
doctrine. But Jesus to show even now the manner and way how that preachers of
the ghospel should behave themselfes: does neither make to humble and vile
suite to have them tarry still with him lest he should seem to do the thing
that other are wounte to do: that is, to show himself to stand in need of
their cumpany: Neither does he speak to the reproach of their going away,
lest therein he might have been thought to have more sought his own praise
and glory, then their salvation: and yet he does not utterly put them away
from him, because they might (perchance) afterward have been better advised:
but to declare that through their own fault they were offended, and so without
any occasion given the^, went away: and yt his saying should not altogether
lack fruit, although that sum made themselfes through infidelity unworthy
any heavenly gift. Jesus (I say) upon these skylles tourning him toward the
twelve Apostles, whom he had admitted and taken unto him, to be the special
witnesses and bruters abroad, of all the things that he wroughte, did so get
out of them the open confession of their belefe, that he neither retains
these with flatterye, as though he had gonne about his own buisinesse rather
then theyrs, neither did he to much fear them with threatening and chiding,
lest they should seem to follow Jesus, rather compelled, then (with their
own consent) persuaded. For no man is to be compelled unto the faith of the
gospel. And Jesus had leauer men should openly forsake him, then to have a
disciple colourably and fayuedly: And therefore whiles other were departing from
him, Jesus says to the twelve: And will ye also go away from me? ye may
tarry still and ye lust, unless ye think it more your commodity to depart.
Uerely I do desire that it might be every man's luck to have this heavenly
gift by me: but it is neither to be given to them that refuse it, Will ye also
go away etc.
for they do not deserve it, nor any manne can attain to cum by it, except
he be desirouse of it. And yet it is the gift of the father that any man does
covet and earnestly desire it. Here now does Simon Peter, a man always of a
plain and ardent faith toward Jesus (representyng in his person the whole
church) and in the name also of other, makes answer cherefully, and with
great courage saying: O Lord, God forbid that we should forsake the, for
considering that we be much desirous of eternal salvation, Thou have the
words of eternal life, etc.
and also know right well how bare and unpleasant, how cold and unprofitable
those things are, which the Phariseis teach, and seeing also that we have
heard John testifying of the, whither else and to what other man should we go
from thee* for thou alone speak the words which bring with them
everlasting life. Thou that receyuest every one (that will cum) shall not drive
us from the, whom thou have once admitted to thy service, neither do we desire
to change our lord and master, for we should change for the wourse, what
new master soever we shall choose. For we not only trusting upon thy words
believe thee, but also we know by the very deeds that thou do and have
certainlye found and tried out thereby that thou art very Christ and the
anointed son of God: We are sure that thou art Christ. etc.
of whom only all men ought to hope for eternal health and salvation. But
Jesus did neither show himself much to wounder at this stout saying of
Peter, whereby Peter did so hielye report of Christ, lest he should seem to
take pleasure in men's praisyng of him, nor he did not utterly refuse it, lest
he should so have denied the truth: but exhortyng all men to persevere in that
faithful confession, which Peter had made in all their names, he did sumwhat
disclose that one of those few should be such one as should not only go
from him, as other disciples had done, but should also covenant with his
adversaries, and betraye him even to death. And his pleasure was to sygnifye
that thing covertly, because he would not bewray Judas: lest any man should
think that Judas being with such a rebuke provoked, did worthily revenge
himself upon his master, and Jesus mind was also to cause every man with
this saying to beware lest through their own fault, they fall into so wicked
a deed. And he says: what is the cause ye do meruaill that already sum of my
disciples are gone away from me? have not I chosen you as most excellent, out
from amongst all other? And yet one of so small a number and so specially
chosen is a very devil, and shall accuse and betraie him whose body he has
eathen, and whose blood he has dronke^ carnally, but not spiritually: whom he
has heard also preach, and seen do miracles. Therefore do not shrink from
the thing that you have begone, as they have done, whom ye have seen go away,
but persevere and wax always better and better, until ye may wurthelye cum to
be such, as can spiritually eat the food of my heavenly doctrine, and being
thereby as it were converted into me, ye shall obtain everlasting life.

The.vij. Chapter.

BUt after that our Lord Jesus went about and was much co^uersau^t in Galile,
for so much as by reason of his words which did implie certain heavenly
things, and things of greater importance than man's reason could reach, and
also through the miracles that he wrought, he gat him self much envy amongst
his own disciples, who had him in more conte^pte, because he was known unto
the^ by being in house among them: and verily the baseness of the house and
parents that he came of, made their hatred more bitter and vengeable against
him. For he could not now live in Iewry with surety of his life, because ye
Jews had a good while sought ways to kill him, yet Jesus went not out of
Iewrie for fear of death, or that he had not power to slide away out of the
midst of their wily trains as often as he list: but showing himself very
man, he laid before his disciples as it were an image and portrature of
things that should follow, to whom it should chance, that through the
maliciouse infidelity of the Jews, he should be compelled to go from them to
the Gentiles. But the Jews very feastful hye and solemn day, which is among
the Greeks called Scenopegia (in English the feast of tabernacles) was at
hand. And this feast had that name scenopegiam, to call to remembrance the
old Patriarchs, and their ways: which led their life in pauilions and
tents, many times remouyng from place to place, even so at that time declaring
by a figure what manner of life theirs ought to be, which profess the doctrine
of the gospel. And because a great mayn company of folks came now against
this holy time and hye feast out of all Syria, His brethren therefore said unto
him.
and other countries which border thereupon thick and threfold unto
Jerusalem, for the solemnity of the temple, the holiness and religion whereof
was had in reverence even among the heathen people, Jesus kynsfolkes all
ignorant and subject as yet to worldly desires and affeccions, having affiaunce
in the title of their kindred, more boldly than was mete, exhort him, as if he
had been desirous of fame and glory, but yet they took him to be timorouse, and
of less audacitie than behooved him, and for that cause they move him that if
he thought himself well enough aided and durst trust thereto, that he would not
lurk and hide himself amongst the aliens of Galile, but would work and
perform at Jerusalem, in the full sight and even in the midst of the
people that was resorted thither, those things which he had so hiely spoken
of himself. The great day and solemn feast (say they) is at hand: leave
Galile therefore, whereas thou have to long time kept thy self close, and go
into Jury the most flourishing part of the whole kingdom, and so bring thyselfe
to Jerusalem the chief city, There is no man that does any thing in
secret. etc.
and head place of all the Jewish nation, thou may there get many disciples
if they all once look upon thy doings. No man that would be extemed, does
those things privily and in corners, whereby he may get a name amongst men. If
thou be cum from heaven in deed, and can do so great things as thou say
thou can, do so that thou may be known to the world. But let no man
meruail at this carnal, presumptuouse, and very ungodly saying of the lord
Jesus kinsfolks. For of truth at that time, they that were his nigh kinsmen
(and therefore called his brethren) and knit to him by a straight familiarity,
For his brethren believed not in him.
did not believe on him: of who^, sum for all that, being afterward of the
number of his Apostles, did most constantely setfurth Christ's glory in their
preachinges.

Jesus therefore according to his singular modesty and gentilnes, did blame the
boldness of his familiar friends easily, and with great softness, signifying
that carnal kindred has no inrresse in that he did concerning the salvation of
mankind, but that all such business (because it is heavenly) is to be
moderate by thauctoritie of the father of heaven: he declared also that he
neither feared death, which he was ready willingly to suffer for the salvation
of mankind, nor that he desired the glory of this world, the hatred whereof he
did provoke toward himself by speaking truth, and things contrary to men's
worldly affeccions: My time is not yet cum etc.
and in consideracion hereof, Jesus said: My time is not yet cum. When that
shall exhort me, then shall not need your aduertisementes.

It depends of the father of heavens determinacion, and not of man's devise
how and when it behooves me to be known to the world. I that came at the
fathers pleasure and arbitremente, have my time. But your time (which being
led with worldly affeccions, seeks for the glory of this world and would
have me according to the judgment of the world to glory) is always ready. The
world cannot hate you.
Ye may safely go whither ye list, when as the world loves you as men
comfortable thereunto. I do not seek glory at the worlds hand with this
affeccion and love that ye hunte about for it, for I seek my fathers glory, and
go about the salvation of man. It is so unlike and far of, that I should (by
any kind of f^attery) get glory and praise in the world, that I do rather
bring the hatred of the world upon me by dissentinge from the lusts and
carnal pleasures thereof, and by testifying openly yt the works of it are
euel, not withstanding that the world self puts forged godliness and false
felicity in such works as be but carnal and worldly. The Jews have their
feastfull days which now of late time God abhors. For they offer
unthankful sacrifices and odiouse to God, seying in the mean time they have
their hands all bloody, and in the self same days which they would should be
thought pure and holy, they go about the death of innocents. There is one
true feastfull day which I must celebrate spiritually, wherewith the father is
pleased and delited. That day is not yet cu^, but when it shall cu^ I shall
willingly go mete with it. You that are yet still carnal and worldly wise, get
you up to this solemn feast. I intend not to go with you to this great feast
that is now me at hand, I will not go up to this feast. etc
for because my time is not yet fullye accomplished. With these words our
lord Jesus sent away from him his natural kynsmen, being always wont to set
aside the regard and affeccion toward them, as often as the vusynes of the
gospel was to be gone in hand withal, which matter because he would it
should be wholly ascribed to his fathers will and arbitreme^t, he would not
suffer it to be polluted with any worldly thing. Thus did he restrain and stint
the authority of his mother at the marriage, and again he was evil apaied, and
in manner thought scorn and disdayned that he should be called out by his
mother and kynsfolkes from talking of the gospel, and after that he had made
his abode a while with his nigh friends at Capernau^, he left them and set in
hand to preach: furthermore hanging upon the cross he called his mother
woman, as though he had known no mother in ye business. Yea and also being a
child but of.xii. years old, he seemed to disdain that by their authority he
should be called from his fathers affairs. Now therefore they supposyng that
for fear of the Jews Jesus would not cum to the hye and solemn feast, went
thither alone. And they going up to Jerusalem, Jesus tarried still in Galile:
so tempering al his doings and with moderacion duelye bestowing the^, that
sometime he proved himself to be very man, lest he should not have seemed to be
man, and sum other time he showed great likelihood of his godly power, lest
men should believe that he was but man only. But after that his brethren were
departed and gone toward the feast, then did he himself go after: so that the
matter is plain, he did not so much refrain going to ye solemn meting for
fear of the Jews, as he did to eschew the coumpany of his kinsmen, whom
being as yet carnal, he would not have to be associate with him in the gospels
cause, or to have any medlyng therewith. But he came to Jerusalem, not to
auaunt himself, but as it were by stelth and privily, and as a man would say,
to cause them the more earnestlye to look for his cu^myng: and when his time
were, to cum abroad and declare himself to the broad world with more fruit.
For he knew the Phariseis minds, how that they had been a great while about
in their conuenticles and secret counsels to find sum occasion upon the holy
day to attache and apprehende him. Now therefore when he was of truth cum to
Jerusalem, but as yet he went not abroad into the common resort and assembly
of people as he was wont to do, the Jews marked him and laid spyal for him
whether he went to the keeping of the holy day or no, and forasmuch as they
desired to se him, they enquired one of an other where he was. And even now
already many sundry tales went of him among the people, as if he had been
absent, because all men had not one opinion nor were not like affected toward
Jesus. For of surety many of the homely sort of the people which had been
present at his miracles workyng, and had heard him preach, who also had had
experience of his gentleness by being in his cumpany, said that Jesus was a good
man, and one not mete to be evil entreated and cruelly handled. Of the
contrary side, the Priests and Phariseis, whom the praise and renoume which
was of Jesus had vexed a great while, denied that he was a good man* who like a
sedicious fellow did allure the people to him and turn the^ from having the
Priests, Scribes, and Phariseis in reverence. Uerely these sayings were by
secret whisperinges sperpled abroad concerning Jesus, whereas no man durst in
ye mean while openly make any good report of him: Howbeit there was many
which had a good opinion of him: Howbeit no man spoke ^penly of him. etc.
For they feared the head men of the Jews, of whom they knew Jesus to be
much hated, because he seemed with his words and deeds to diminishe their
authority. Moreover, as touching the kepinge of him self out of the way, he
so did of very mekenes and modesty, lest he should be thought wittingly and
willingly to have provoked the malice of the Phariseis, who sought for
nothing else but matter and occasion to put him to death. That he did go
abroad, was done for their cause who^ he knew should be furthered to
salvation by his doctrine: For fear of the Jews.
whereas he was not ignorant yt the Phariseis and Scribes would grow more
heady and fierce through that he should say and do for the salvation of the
world. For the Lord being most desirous of man's salvation, coueted that if
it might be possible, his doctrine should work salvation in all men: but yet
so much was not to be given to the frowardnes of certain, that the doctrine
of the gospel was to be withdrawn and kept from the good simple people.

Therefore when as the high an solemn feast was half done, Jesus went openly
in the sight of all men into the temple, and there taught the people not
pharisaicall ordinances or ceremonies of the law, which should anon after
cease, but the philosophy and wisdom of the gospel. But when the Jews could
pick no quarrel against his doctrine, yet they devise and study to bring him
out of credence and to diminishe his authority among the people, meruailinge
how that he, being not learned and unlettered (for in deed he was never brought
up in pharisaicall doctrine, in the reading and profession whereof they swelled
for pride) should cu^ by those sayings, which he alleged and brought out of
holy scripture, How knows be the scripture?
with great wisdom, and to much purpose: in manner appeaching him as one that
had a devil to teach him, or that he had cu^ by the knowledge of that
learning (which he learned of no man) by sum other magical art and deiuilishe
witchecraft. The Jews therefore in consyderacio^ hereof, said: how does this
fellow, a Carpe^ter himself, and a Carpenters son, read and understand
sciences, when as he never learned the^? Uerely Jesus, to show us an exau^ple
of sobriety and gentle behavior, very courteously and with much lenity put
away and confuted their so sinful and wicked suspicion, declaring plainlye yt
his doctrine came neither of man nor devil, but even of God whom they also did
wurship: and whose glory and honor they ought of duty to favor, if they
would be taken for true godly men, and as for himself, he told them plainly,
that he did neither challenge to himself the doctrine which they woondred at,
nor the honor and praise which they did envy: but that altogether came of the
father of heaven, whose business he did. He told them furthermore that
forasmuch as they had taken upon them the perfect knowledge of the law which
God gave unto the^, and did disdainfully loathe other as unlearned and very
ideotes, it were indifferentlye done that in case they had the very true
knowledge of scripture, they should embrace and acknowledge the doctrine
which proceeded from the same, from whom the law came: unless they would make
men know, that envy, hatred, desire of their own glory, love of gain and
lucre, and such like inordinate and carnal desires, which proceeds of a
leude mind, had blinded their judgment. For God is not (says he) contrary
to himself, that now he would teach by his son a contrary thing to that he
gave in his law. Therefore Jesus knowing all their secrets, made this answer
to their secret murmuring, saying: My doctrine which ye wonder of whom I
should have it, for so much as I have learned no letter of any man, is not
mine: (for in deed I do bring you no new learning of man that differs from
the will of God and the mind of the law which was given you of God) but it
is my fathers doctrine which has sent me into the world: that the world
being seduced with the sundry and manifold doctrines of men, and blinded with
wicked affeccions and naughty desires, might by me know my fathers will: and
when it is known follow it, and so by following of it, obtein eternal life.
For of truth his will is this, that they that believe his sons sayings, by
whom he teaches you and speaks unto you, should get thereby everlasting
health. And the cause why many do less mind and desire that thing, is envy,
hatred, ambition, advantage, and other evil desires and carnal lusts. But
if any man would (setting aside all malice) with a true meaning and a plain
simple heart, If any man will be obedient unto his will.
obey my fathers will, rather then his own lewd and ungracious affeccions, he
will soon recognyse my doctrine not to be of man, or any new and strange
inuencion of the devil, but to becum from God: nor that I do speak those
things which I say, of man's reason and wit, but after my fathers mind
whose ambassador I am. Men that be more studiouse of their own glory than of
Gods, do prefer new doctrine of their own inuencio^ before the doctrine
of God, He that speaks of himself seeks his own praise
to be made more of in ye world themselves. For they had rather be taken for
authors of man's doctrine, the whole glory whereof should altogether
continually redound to themselfes, then to be public preachers of Gods
doctrine: and had leauer teach those things, which might get to themselfes
praise and advantage, then that which should bring glory and honor to God, or
salvation to their neighbor. But he that seeks not his own praise, but his
from whom he is sent, speaks all things purely and vncorruptely, neither is
his doctrine in danger of any error, or fauty through the lusts of ambicion,
of avarice, envy or hatred.

I teach no other thing then that which God had taught you by his law, if a
man understand the meaning of the law, nor I do nothing else but that the law
prescribes unto me. The authority of Moses is an hallowed thing, and had in
reverence with you that despise me. And did not he take you a law which he
received at Gods hand: Ye take upon you the right understanding and keeping of
the law, whereas none of you does truly observe the law after the will of
God, who gave you the law: yea rather under a color and pretense of the
law, ye go about those things which he does most deteste and punish. Ye
lay blasphemy unto my charge because I do more seek the glory of God then
man's praise. Ye object against me the breakyng of the Sabbath day, who have
saved a man on the Sabbath day, when as the holy religion of the Sabbath does
not stay you from deuisyng and laboring to destroy an innocent, and not only
an innocent, but such one as has deserved good at your hands. Is this to
magnify Moses whom ye prefer before me? Is this to honor and reverence God,
whom ye with feyned religion wurshippe? Does not the law curse him that
sheadeth innocents blood* Neither does it permit any power or authority of
putting to death but upon malefactors, nor upon them neither, except they be
lawfully convicted and condemned. Why than do ye contrary to the law trauaill
about my death, that being sent of God do preach his will and pleasure to you
according to the intent of the law: that do seek his glory and not mine own:
that do not effectuously seek a kingdom or riches to myself, but that do freely
offer salvation to all men: that hurt no man but do good to all men? This
saying of Jesus did vex and trouble the Phariseis minds for two causes: first
because they perceived well that their crafty inuencions (though they were
secretly done) were not hid from his knowledge, The people answered and said,
thou have a devil.
whom they supposed might soon without difficulty have been made away, if
the thing that they went about could have been kept secret from him:
Secondarily his words pinched their minds, because he did appeal them of
sinful transgression of the law, in the presence of the people, who would
have been thought most true obseruers of the law. They laying snares for the
innocent blood, feared not the knowledge of God, but they feared to have their
deeds known to the people. Therefore to face out the thing by dissimulacio^,
they let fare as if they thought the multitude did not know their wickedness,
and so fell to open rebukes and checkes as is the manner of all wicked persons
that are taken with the manner in a mischeuouse deed that cannot be excused.
Thou have (say they) the devil, seeing thou make the father of heaven very
God himself, Who goes about to kill thee?
to be auctour of thy doctrine, to auaunt thy self thereby. God is true, and
thou by the devils instigacion art untrue. Who goes about to devise thy death*
The Lord Jesus did not brawle with them again with any checking answer to
their so furiouse blasphemy, lest he should have made them more wood by
putting to of fury to them, that were already cruel and fur^ouse: but giving
us an ensaumple of mildness, full gentelly he tells them the cause why he
did the deed, for the which they quarelled with him. And where as themselfes
in very deed were breakers of the law in all things, yet did they accuse
Jesus, as a transgressour of the law, because he had healed a man sick of the
Palsy on the Sabbath day.

I (says Jesus) did one certain deed on ye Sabbath day, which was neither
evil, sinful, nor yet dishonest: but wherewith I gave health to a man that was
miserably diseased, which you your selves could not but allow and commend, in
case it had not been done on the Sabbath day. But they do rather break the
Sabbath which goes about that thing on the Sabbath, which is sinful and
wicked, on what day soever it be done. The religion of the Sabbath is not so
great, but it ought to give place to those things which are of more weight
and greatter importance, and good and godly every day whenever they be done.

If Moses himself, whom ye highly esteem and attribute so much unto, have
given you the same exaumple, and has done before me like wise as I have doe^:
If also the very law do teach that work may be done on the Sabbath day
without breakyng the law of the Sabbath, either ye must needs absolve and
clear me: or else ^n case ye condemn me, ye must also condemn Moses with me,
and the law it self to, because whatsoever he gave unto you, was a law.
Moses gave circumcision unto you, not that circumcision began even very than
when Moses law began, for it was given of God to the Patriarchs before the
law was written: and for that cause circumcision is a greatter matter in
religion then the Sabbath day, because it went before the law, and is as it
were, the head of the law. But the very same Moses which commanded
circumcision, commanded the Sabbath day. You do circumcise a man on the
Sabbath day, and ye think not that ye violate the Sabbath day therein: because
of the dignity of circumcision, whereunto ye think that ye religion of the
Sabbath ought of right to give place: like as the Deacons and Priests do also
in the temple these things which be pertaining to Gods service, and yet in
so doing they take not theymselfes to be breakers of the Sabbath day, for
somuche as they esteem the thing that they do, to be of more holiness then
that it should be omitted because of the Sabbath day.

And ye on the Sabbath day circumcise a man.
Considering therefore that ye do circu^cise a man on the Sabbothe day, lest
through not being circumcised he should not be one of you, neither do you
wene that the Sabbath day is by that work the wurse kept, I meruaill why than
do you like disdainful men make such clamor, that by my work the Sabbath
day is unkept and broken, who have healed not one part alone of man, but have
preserved and saved the whole manne altogether on the Sabbath day? Although
circumcision were before the law, and is after a sort the very beginning and
chief part of the law* yet it is not perpetual. For men were acceptable and
dearly beloved of God before there was any circumcision, and the time shall be,
when God shall mislyke and refuse the ouerthwarte circumcision of the flesh,
being without the inward circumcision of the heart. But to give health both of
body and soul to a man's ^^ly wretched neighbor, as it is a greater act and a
more holy deed than to circumcise a man, so is it always good: before the law,
in the time of the law, and after the law, because it is of it own self good.

Why than do ye, in a cause not unlike, yea in a much better matter as
touching my behalf, wurship and have Moses in reverence, and accuse me as
giltye of a greater crime? For I do not now dispute which of us twain is
greatter then the other. Take Moses still (as he is) for an excellent man, let
it be so that I am even as you suppose me to be, a mean and an abject person,
yet if ye look well about you, and do consider the matter rightly, either ye
ought to condemn us both, or to assoyle us both. And ye very law, of
truth, teaches us this, that in geuyng judgment, ye should look upon the
matter, and not the person: and he stands accursed that through favoring
the rich, oppresses the poor.

Therefore judge not after the quality of the person, Judge no^ after the
utter apperance. etc.
but let your judgment be just and rightful according to the matter, if ye
will truly observe Moses law. But after these things and many such other
were spoken by our Lord Jesus, so gentelly that they had been able to have
pacified never so cruel a mind, and when his sayings also were so true that
they could not be proved false and confuted of any man, were he never so
shameless, the Phariseis (of truth) ceased from speaking, but nevertheless
they persist and continue in their malice without any mitigacion of mind,
because he durst in the presence of a multitude, in such wise lay from
himself the fault of breakyng the Sabbath, that he burdened them with a much
greater crime.

The Phariseis pride was so great, that they would be thus far priuileged,
that an innocent being accused should rather give over his true cause, then
that their authority should any thing quayle amongst the people: and rather
that Gods praise and glory should be nothing at all spoken upon, than that
any part of their honor should decay. And yet even this kind of men found
many among the people which had rather serve this lewd ambicion of theirs,
then to obey Gods will. For certain of Jerusalem said: Is not this he, whom
the Scribes and Phariseis drift is to put to death: and whom men thought did
hyde himself and durst not cum to the hye feastfull day for fear of them?
Lo, he speaks openly in the temple, and utters his mind unto them frankely
and freely even to their face, yet do they give him no answer. What means
this their silence? Are our head rulers brought in belefe that this is Messiah,
and now confess that thing with silence which they did before impugn and
deny? Howbeit, it is not like to be true that the chief rewlers should thus
think, for even all we know whence this man came. His father and mother are
known well enough to be plain folks and of a mean sort, we know what
country man he is, we know also his brethren and his other kinsfolks. But
when Messiah cummeth he shall so cum, that no man shall know from whence he
cummeth. Then cried Jesus in the temple. etc.
Jesus perceiving their blindness to be so great, that where as the prophecy
had given knowledge beforehande that Messiah should cum out of Bethleem, where
Jesus was borne, and where all other signs of the prophecies agree with him to
all purposes, yet they being blinded with malice, deny that they know him,
for no cause else, but because they know him, and therefore even of purpose they
make a lie, saying that Christ should cum so, that no man should know from
whence he cummeth: and this they forge, because they would not be compelled to
recognyse him. Jesus, I say, from whose knowleage, no not the secrets of men
were hid, to rebuke also this foolish ignorance of the multitude, which was
corrupt with seeing their head men so set and affected, which multitude was
wilfully ignorant in that thing which they might have known, but that their
lewd mind let their judgment, does now with a more shrill and loud
voice (to thintente he might be heard not only of them that were nigh at hand,
but of all the people which were within the temple, a place most convenient
to have Gods glory preached and setfurth in) begin to teach openly who he
was, and from whom he was sent: and that no man could be ignorant who he was,
but either such one as wilfully would be without knowleage, or else he that of
very malice, would not confess the thing that he knew: and thus doing, Jesus
does admonish us therewith, to give place oftentimes to the malice of men,
lest it beying more kindled, should do wurse and more cruelly, and so provoke
a more sorer judgment of God against them: thus also* after that by all
assayes he did all that could be done for their amendment, he might justly
give them over and leave them as desperate persons, to their own folly and
disease, not yt the Glory of God should be hid and conceled, ne yet the
neighbors health and salvation neglected for their obstinate wickedness. If
therefore (says Jesus) ye do not think me to be Messiah, whom by the
prophecies of your Prophets ye look for, because ye know from whence I came,
even that is the very thing which might teach you that I am he in deed, who
have cum after such sort, and was borne in that self place, out whereof the
Prophets has told before hand y^ Messiah should cum. Ye have heard John's
record of me, ye se my miracles, ye hear me bear witness to the truth,
studying about none other thing, but Gods glory and your salvation. And
therefore ye must needs know me, except ye had leauer wylfully be ignorant in
the thing ye know. And how can ye say ye Messiah should so cum that no man can
know from whence he cummeth, when as the Prophets point and assign both his
stock and his country? These things being known unto you, might induce and
further you to the understanding of the prophecy: howbeit it is a thing of
more force and better it were to know from whence I came, And I am not cum of
myself: but he that sent me is true.
than what stock I am borne of. And in case ye would consider me with pure
and sincere iyes, ye could not of truth be ignorant therein. Neither am I so
of the world, nor do now cum out of the world, as ye do slanderously
report of me, but I cum from him that sent me into ye world, to the intent
it might convert and be saved. For I am sent from him whom ye know not, and
for this cause he sent me, that ye also should learn to know him by me, And
him ye know not.
as much as he may of man be known. Albeit ye can by no mean yet know him
except ye apply your selfs through godliness, to deserve that he would give
you knowlage of him. For they know him not, yt does not obey his will: And it
is not sufficient to know God in words, if ye deny him in your deeds. If ye
will have true knowelage of the father, ye must learn it of his son. I only
have truly known him, because I proceeded from him, and was with him before I
came into the world, and I was sent into the world from him to teach you to
know him: that through your belefe ye might be saved. For I came not of mine
own head as other do, sekyng their own praise rather then Gods honor,
teaching their own commentes and fantasies and not the doctrine of God. And he
that sent me is true: and for because I have it of him whatsoever I speak,
therefore my sayings be also true.

was not yet cum. Many of the people believed on him, and said: When Christ
cummeth will he do more miracles then these that this man has done? The seniors
and rulers being stirred and sore heated with these words, weaxed more wood
and chafed more in their hearts because he took unto him such authority
before the people and openly rebuked them of their perverse wickedness. They
had much a do to hold their hands of him, for now their anger was turned
into woodnesse, they now passed nothing of that good aduisement and
deliberacion, wherewith they were purposed to make him away secretly: But
though their will was ready to do that mischievous deed, yet no man at that
time laid hands upon him: Christ willing so to have it, because the time was
not yet cum which his father had appointed, to work therein by his death, the
salvation of the world. For as he willingly dyed, so could not he against his
will be taken. It lay in him to stay men's minds, were they never so fierce,
nor no man's power could prevail against him, unless it had pleased his
exceeding charity toward man to be crucified for the salvation of the world:
but the priests, Scribes, Phariseis, and headmen of the people, whom for their
holy profession and knowlage of the law, it had behooved first of all other to
have acknowlaged Christ, perseuering in their wicked purpose even of corrupt
minds, many of the comminaltie, and of the unlearned in the law, which (as
they were of the less authority and learning, so they had more good minds
and devotion) did so believe our Lord Jesus words and miracles but not yet of
truth fully persuaded that Jesus was Messiah, howbeit they were brought to
this poinct, that they seemed apt to be persuaded: If this man (say they) be
not Christ, as the Phariseis think he is not, yet it is much to be meruailed
at how he has so great power in workyng miracles. For if Messiah himself
should cum, should he do greater things then which this man does?

But the Phariseis and the seniors, whose part had been to have allured and
enticed the unlearned multitude unto Christ, after that they perceived there
was many of the people inclined toward him, fell to such furious headines yt
they were determined every way without any stop, that he ought to dye: which
was thought would obscure their honor. Such a pestilence is ambicion when it
is colored with pretense of religion and doctrine. But in the mean time
fear of daungier, and neither shame nor pity stayed them from manifest doing
of that enormitie. Therefore they did hyre privily the common catch polles to
take Jesus in the sight of the people, and when they had taken him, to bring
him to them as an evil doer. But Jesus that knew their privy conspiracy
conspired against him, and could not be taken except he had list himself,
sumwhat opens unto them by dark sayings, that the time should come when as
he would voluntarily offer himself to death, whereas then they sought his death
in vain, and in a manner also gave them warning to be more glad of him, and well
to use him whiles they had him. For the time should be that all in vain they
should desire him being absent, whom they did persecute being present,
specially when as they could not cum to the place which he should convey
himself to. For he went even to death, whereunto as yet they might not follow
him. He returned again to heaven, and thither was no mortal body able to
pursue after him. Ye shall seek me and shall not find me etc.
Well, Jesus spoke unto them in this manier: I am yet a little while with you
and then go I unto him that sent me. Ye shall then seek me, and not find me,
and where I shall go to, ye cannot cum. The Lord Jesus spoke these things
unto them covertly, as he was wont to do many mo things, that they should
not understand them before they were put in ure and finished. And the darkness
of speaking makes a man diligent to seek the matier. And when the things be
exibite and dooen, the words are more surely believed. Finally, the thing grue
to this point, that it was well known to all men, that whatsoever our lord
suffered, he suffered it advisedly and upon deliberacion, not of casualtie: he
suffered it willingly, and not of necessity. Though these words were spoken
to all men in general, yet it did most specially prick the Phariseis
servants, which were sent to take Jesus, against whom they perceived that
they could nothing do, except he were willing. And whiles he touches secretly
their inward conscience, he declares that he knows what thing soever is
most secretly hid in men's hearts. And therwithall he wins those hertes
unto him through his gentilnes, whose wicked enterprises he did not disclose
unto the people.

Therefore when as the multitude did not understand this his saying, they
reasoned among themselves: Than said the Jews among themselves whither will he
go? etc.
what means this that he says, where I go to, thither can ye not cum? will
he privily steal away and go to sum far country among the heathen people?
will he suffer himself to forsake this holy land and holy people to go dwell
among wicked and profane people, whither he thinks we will never follow him?
or will he wander hither and thither like a vagabounde among the Gentiles
dwelling far away, that he cannot be found of us?

But when the last day of that feast was cum, which was most solemnly kept
with most great resort of people, and with great religion, (for when this day
was past, every man was glad to repair home again) Jesus stood up in the
temple as though he also would leave the country of Iurye, and does halow that
most solemn day of that great feast with a notable sermon, and therewith
purueyed vitailes of evangelical faith of the gospel, for them that should
journey. Nor he did not only speak openly, but also cried with a firm and a
stayed voice, thereby declaryng that the matier was mete to be heard of all
folk. The Phariseis had babished the simple people, with fained and cold
religion, and had tangled their consciences with man's ordinances. And surely
the multitude had nothing else almost in admiracion that Jesus said or did but
his miracles. But for somuche as they had not drounke of the spirit of the
gospel, they took the less spiritual profit at his hands. Therefore Jesus
called and allured all men openly from the barren and cold doctrine of the
Phariseis, If any man thirst, let him cumme unto me and drink.
unto himself, promisyng them the spirit, which once being received, not
only they (by his grace) themselves shall attain to the true and evangelical
doctrine, but shall also by their preaching issue forth upon other great
abundance and efficacy of wisdom: I am (says he) the fountain of
helthfull wisdom: whosoever thirsts, let him ask nothing of Moses, the
Phariseis, the Scribes, or of the priests. Let him cum to me, and drink of
this well. And whosoever believes my words, the same drinks. Therefore
whosoever believes on me, and desyrously drinks up my words, as the
scripture bids bearing witness of me, he shall not weaxe dry throw
infidelity, but ye draught that he drunk of the spirit of God, shall bring
forth in his heart a well that shall run evermore and plentifully, in such
wise, that out of his heart shall flow, not only small little streams, but
also great and ple^teous fluddes, wherewith the dryness of the Gentiles shall be
watered, and thereof shall spring much fruit of the gospel. By this parable
and far of speaking, Jesus did mean that fertile and ple^teous spirit which
afterward they should receive that would believe on him: which spirit after
that the Apostles had received, forthwith they begone with great confidence to
preach in diverse toungues to the whole world ye philosophy of the gospel,
and to distill into the souls of all that believed on Christ, the same spirit
that they received from heaven. For albeit that many at that time had sum
smattering and were sumwhat entered into knowlage of the faith, for all that
the very effectual and plentiful spirit was not yet cum to any of them, for
because Jesus was not by his death and resurreccion glorified, nor had not
ascended up to heaven to sit on the fathers right hand, from whence he
should send that spirit to his Apostles. But the mystery of the cross was
to be performed before, which thing could not be done and accomplished,
except his glorious majesty had been kept secret, and as it were dissembled
for a season: and they also could not be made able to receive that divine
spirit, unless they had first been framed and fashioned thereunto by many
miracles, sayings and doings. Therefore the Lord Jesus does call and bid all
folk to this well of the water of life, yet he compels no man against his
will, nor he excludes no man, so that he cum athirst.

When the Lord Jesus had spoken this, and many mo like things, though they
were not fullye understand, yet they did work sundry minds and affeccions
in the multitude of the people: for sum, upon sight of so many miracles, and
the great authority of his words, said: truly this is a very prophet.
Again, other that thought more hyghly of him, said: yea this is that very
Messiah, whom the prophets have promised in their prophecies. On the contrary
side, other being corrupted with pharisaicall leven, went about to reprove and
confute these men's opinion by the very words of the prophets, which told
before that he should rise out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the town of
Bethleem. Christ was thought with most part of men to be borne in Nazareth,
because he was nursed there, and brought up with his parents which dwelte
there, and also because he began his preaching in Galile: and for the most
part had his abode there. But the people of Jerusalem and the Jews that were
of the tribes of Jury, took the people of Galile as men nigh neighbors unto
the heathen, and were myxte together, but for half their countrymen, because
they neither excelled in knowledge of the law, nor ever had any prophet in
whom they might worthily rejoice. They knew verily that Messiah was promised
to the tribe of Judah, not to men of Galile, and that he should cum of the
seed of David, who had his princely palace at Jerusalem. And thus therefore
they did challenge unto them, honor of Christ to cum, whom they themselfes
being with malice corrupted now at his very cumming did persecute. They say
therefore: it is not like to be true that this man should be Messiah, if you do
ponder and straightly examine the prophecies. When Christ shall cum shall he cum
to us out of Galile? does not the prophecies manifestly say that Messiah
shall come of the sede of David, who was certainly of the trybe of Judah? And
further more, it also expresses the tounes name where he should be borne,
that is to say, Bethleem, which is the city of David, that was given to Judas
for his part or tribe. Therefore forasmuch as the prophecy does plainlye
show that he should cum of a kings stock, of the most holy tribe of all
Judah, out of a princely town, how can it stand and accord that this man
should be Messiah, whose parents be poor and of no estimacion, and cummeth
to us out of a vile town, of no name, which stands in Galile a country of
no renown? After this sort the people disputed of Jesus with diverse
judgments, and there was dissencion among them for his sake. Yet did not
Jesus accumpany himself with them in this disputacion, because they did not
dispute with such simple pureness of mind, that they did deserve to be
taught: and it was not yet time to declare himself how great and excellent a
man he was. For if they had uprightly and truly desired to know who he was,
they themselves might have learned of Jesus kinsfolks that he was not borne at
Nazareth as more part of them supposed, but in Bethleem, and that he came of
David's family. Nor there was not a few that knew these things, but because
Jesus did not bring with him, and show unto them things agreeable to their
lusts, they were more wyllyng to serve their own affeccions, than to receive
and acknowledge him. For and if their mind had been plain, simple and pure,
they might have learned the thing wherabout they contended, in case they would
have asked Jesus himself the question. And there were many of the people so
blinded with envy and hatered, that they conspired among theymselfes to take
our Lord Jesus and lay hands on him. But the malice of man had no power and
strength against him, who has all things in his power.

And therefore the sergeauntes whom the Phariseis had sent as servants of
their mad fury, to attache Jesus, returned again, with their minds clean
changed, unto the hye priests and Phariseis, which with fierce and cruel
minds, tarried lokyng for their servants to have brought the apprehended
person unto them, to the inte^te that so at last they might have satisfied and
accomplisshed their hatered upon him.

But in the mean time the provision of God, which far passes all worldly
men's craft and subtlety, procured such succoure, that whatsoever the
malicious Phariseis went about to procure, the same lighted upon their own
heads and made well for the setting forth of Christ's glory. The unlearned
multitude, the rude ignorant people of Galilee, the Samaritanes, the
Cananites, and the Heathen people being moved with Jesus sayings and doings,
believed on him. Only the Scribes, Phariseis, seniors, and priests in whose
governance the open confession and discussion of the whole law and religion
was, were not only never a deal moved to cum to better aduisement, and to be
converted: but were made every way wurse and more wood. It was now cum to this
point, that their hiered men the catch polles, a curryshe kind of people, and
ready to be hiered to do all unhappiness for money, should both honestly
report of Jesus, and also reprove their incurable blyndnesse. These servants
had seen no miracles wroughte, they had but only heard him speak a few
words, yet having their minds clean altered, and without any regard to the
commandments of the Phariseis, they returned again unto them, and brought
not Jesus with them. And when they that sent them, asked and quarelled with
them, why they did not as they were commanded, the men did not lay for their
excuse the fear of the multitude, nor feined any other excuse, but frankly and
freely confessed that of truth they went purposely to have taken Jesus, and to
have brought him with them, but they were through a few of his affectuouse and
gracious words, so as it were charmed and newely hearted again, that they
utterly repined in their hearts to do that thing which they had purposed: we
never (say they) heard manne speak as this man does. Who can lay violent
hands upon such like men? What record could have been avouched in the
synagoge, which should more have burdened and pressed, and more openly
disclosed the Phariseis obstinate malice? They did all they could to the
vttermoste of their power to subvert the doctrine of Jesus, but all their
endeavor went backewarde: for whiles they went about by all the ways they
could, utterly to destroy Christ and his doctrine, they stablishe and set forth
both. But as yet still they dissemble the wood fury of their hearts, speaking
to their servants more courteously and more quietly then according to the
fury of their thoughts: how chaunsed this say they? Does any of ye rulers
or of the Phariseis believe on him?
Are ye which belong to us, and therefore not to be taken as of the rascal
noumbre, also deceived by him? Do ye not perceive him to go about to deceive
men with fair promises, and to sell false ware for good? If he were true, do
ye not think that such notable men as does excel both in learning and
authority would approve his sayings? do ye see any rulers or magistrates,
unto who^ the authority of the religion belongs, or any of the Phariseis,
which has the most exact knowledge of the law, persuaded by his words?
does the exaumple of a few ^atifes, a sort of drudges, move you? This sort
of people is ignorant, and knows not the law, and therefore are accursed.
Well, even God thus disposed these things, to certify and teach us that
nothing does more obstinately resist true religion, then the malice of them
which are cloked with the false pretense of religion, nor no man more deadly
enemy to ye doctrine of the gospel, then he that wresteth holy scripture to his
own lewd affeccions: neither are any more desperately wicked, then those,
which with pretense of holiness, with persuasion of learning, with public
authority, be armed against the truth of the gospel. But in deed, whatsoever
this world deuiseth with all his engyns against the heavenly truth the
success thereof is to the glory of our lord Jesus Christ. Now than, mark me
this well (O wise reader) that there is no where more scarcity of them, that
with their hearts favors the christen truth, than among the ringleaders of
religion, and head learned men.

In so great a counsel which was of Phariseis, Scribes, Seniours, and
Priests, there was no man save only Nicodemus which would stand in the
defense of that innocente lord, against such wicked enterprises. This
Nicodemus was one of the headmen of the sect of Phariseis, a gross man of
truth and less learned the^ other, but he was of a less corrupt mind: and it
was the same which for fear of the Jews came to Jesus by night (as I told you
before) to be better instructed by him through private and secret
communicacio^.

And by that one metyng, he profited so much that he took Jesus for a good
man, though he did not fully understand the mystery and spiritual meaning of
his word. When this man saw his fellows with blood suckyng minds, tend to
the utter destruction of Jesus, whom he so favored that nevertheless he
feared the malice that was armed with authority, he took Jesus part wa^ely:
And spoke those things for him which might have been spoken for any
malefactor before he had been convicted: we do (says he) profess a law,
whith does not condemn the evil doer, except he be first heard, and the
matters duly discussed, which be laid to his charge that is accused. Let
this manne have at least this benefit of the law, which is common for all
folk: and the law self gives it even to them that be misdoers. When they
had no matter once to open their mouth to speak against this so indifferent
and manerly defense, which Nicodemus used in speaking for Christ, they do not
only not call themselfes home, and turn to a better mind, ^or yet be
pacified and appeased, but without regarding the man's dignity and authority
they fall in hand to rebuke him, and to his reproach, say thus unto him: art
thou also now become a man of Galile? The common people and the unlearned are
to be holden excused, and may be forgeuen: but is it not a great shame for
thee that art an head man, and a doctor of the law, to be the disciple and
scholar of this Galile man, Search and look, for out of Galile a rises no
prophet.
which is a very deceiuer of the people? to whom no man joins himself, but
such as be most vile abiectes before men, and cursed before God* Thou that
professest the knowledge of the law, and art an open reader and discusser of
the same, search well the scriptures, and throughlye examine them, and if thou
find any where throughout all the scriptures that either any prophet has
ever cum or ever shall cum out of Galile: believe then this fellow to be a
prophet. This answer of the Phariseis was not only wicked, but also
folishe. For Nicodemus had not affirmed him to be a prophet, but said:
whosoever he be, he ought not after our common, or rather public law, (that is
to say, a law which indifferently perteyneth to all men of every state) to be
condemned, except his cause be known before. But where malice and hatred is in
the heart, and occupies the powers of the mind, there is no judgment. After
these things were commoned to and fro from one to an other, the counsel brake
up and was dismissed: And so every man went home, their will to beriue Christ of
his life, being delayed and proroged, but not changed. For Jesus time was not
as yet.

The.viii. Chapter.

ANd so now (when it drew nere night) Jesus went unto mount Oliuete, where
Bethanie was, a pleasant lodgeyng for the lord, considering that there was
no quiet place in Jerusalem: and herein he taught us that a secret place, or
some vacacio^, is convenient for preachers of the gospel: and that the truth
has no where less place, than in rich and welthy cities. Howebeit sometime
the evangelical wise preachers shall resort thither, not to get riches or
honor, but to do good to other: though they do endaungier their lives
thereby. Therefore the next day following, Jesus returned again to Jerusalem
early in the morning, and now not sta^dyng (as he did the day before) but
sat down, and taught in the temple, with a bold countenance: openly showing
himself to be nothing afearde of the Phariseis wicked conspiracies. And all
the people came in a great assembly unto him, partly being brought to have him
in admiracion through the miracles and words that he had done and spoken
before time: and partly to intrappe him, and to get matter to harm him.

And for because they had marked in him a certain merueilous clemencye and
gentle patience toward the poor miserable common people, thereat they took
occasion to accuse him: whereas they ought y^ rather to have loved him. Moses
law had ordained a sore statute against aduoutrie, that is to say, that in
case any woman were taken unlawfully vsyng her self with any other manne, she
should be stoned at the peoples hands. And in the mean while the men
pardoning themselfes, were extreme against the women: as though they should be
innocent before god, or avoid eternal pain, if they were not punished by the
law, though otherwise they committed greater faults. The law only punishes
open faults: It does not punish pride, hautenes of mind, nor hatred, but god
does more abhor these thniges, the^ ye other, which ye law punishes.

Now therefore the Scribes and Phariseis, (that is to wete, men ye know well
enough, very severe kepers of justice, and of very zeal and love to ye law
fiercely set against malefactors, and open sinners, when they themselves are
inwardly in their hertes soused and washed with much more enormious sins)
brought a woman taken in aduoutrie unto Jesus, at that time sitting in the
temple. They set the woman openly in the mids of ye people, to thintente that
if Christ would have given sentence of condemnacion against her, And the
Scribes and Phariseis brought unto him a woman taken in aduoutrie.
many of the multitude should have borne him less favor, whose favor he
had gotten, chiefly by reason of his lenity and gentleness, but and if he
should pardon her and clearly dismiss her, as they thought he would have
done, that then they might find some fault by him, whereof to accuse him:
which was not afraid to forgive an aduouterer contrary to Moses ordinance and
law: and so then they hope to bring to pass, that (when all should beset on a
roar) in steed of the woman, Christ himself should be overthrown and eue^
pressed down with stones. And verily these Phariseis themselves, being more
wicked sinners, accuse the sinful woman before Jesus, as a judge on this wise.
This woman (say they) was even now taken in aduoutrie, even as the deed was
doing, and Moses made us a law that such should be stoned. Therefore we bring
her unto the people to be stoned, except thou disagree thereunto: what thynkest
thou?

Uerely Jesus, who knew the secrets of their hearts, and was ignorant in no
manier of thing were it never so privy, did so elude and disapoynte their
malice, by his godly wisdom, that he delivered the aduoutresse out of the
stonecasters hands, and yet did not clearly absoyle her as fautlesse, lest he
should seem to abrogate Moses law, which was necessarily given, to cause men
refrain from evil deeds. This, I say, did Jesus, who came not to break and
abrogate the law, but to fulfill it: and again on the other side, he did not
condemn her, because he came not into the world to have sinners lost, but to
save them. For of truth Jesus does every where so moderate his words, as
touching those ordinances which the world observes necessarily, even to
preserve a public peace, and for a common quietness, that he neither much
allows them, nor improueth them, but upon occasion thereof, gives monicion
that generally all ungraciousness is to be eschewed, and not only these deeds
which worldly princes laws do punish.

For truly there be in gods judgment crimes more horrible than these, which
yet the law does not punish, notwithstanding they cannot escape punishment at
gods hand where he takes on hand to revenge the doer. Therefore Jesus does
neither refuse the judgment, which was committed unto him, forasmuch as he is
judge over all, nor he does not appoint and commit the woman, which was guilty,
unto the men that were in readiness to cast stones, neither does he clear the
woman of the matter, who in deed had deserved to be punished: but with silence
he succoureth her, that was pulled and hurried to pain, to preserve her unto
penance: and that she might with due repentance be better advised, and
convert to health and salvation. He gave no answer by word of mouth, but
he spoke the more by his deed. He knew the selye guilty woman to be a sinner,
but he also knew her accusers, which would have been thought righteous, to
be more sinful then she was. He did not take away Moses law, but he showed
the mercifulnes of Christ's new law, whereof he was thauctor: he informed them
that drew the faulty woman to cruel pain, to look well upon themselves, and
according to gods law, to examine their own conscience duly: and every one
to show himself such a one toward his neighbor that had offended, as he
would have god to judge him. This thing our Lord Jesus did for our
instruccion, and he bowed down himself, to signify that a man, al
stateliness and pride laid down (wherewith any man flattered himself, and of
an hault mind despised his neighbor,) should descend down into himself, and
look well upon himself: and being bowed down, Jesus wrote upon the ground,
even to give us warnyng that God shall judge every man after the law of the
gospel: The law written in tables, made them by an untrue righteousness proud
and arrogant. The law written upon the ground, makes every man through a
conscience and knowlage of his own infirmity, meke and merciful unto his
neighbor.

Now whiles the Jews preaced still upon him, Let hi^ that is among you without
sin cast ye first stone at her.
to know his judgment (although he had already by his deed pronounced it) he
stood up, and so told them plainly his mind, that wist not what he meant by
his doing, and said: He that is among you without sin let him cast the first
stone at her. With this saying he did not clearly assoyle the offender, but he
pierced their consciences. And every one of them knowing himself guilty,
feared lest Jesus, to whom they saw were known even most hid and seret
things, should have published their ungracious acts. When he had thus pricked
their conscience, he stouped down again, and wrote upon the ground, as it
were by that deed paintyng before their iyes, what he would have them to do.

He noted their arrogancy, which took upon them to be holy, when as in deed
they were more sinful then those whom the law extremely punished. For she,
whom they had brought forth to be stoned with the common hands of many, had
not killed her husband: but through the frailty of the flesh, had given the
use of her body to an other man, and so committed aduoutrie. They being full of
envy, hatered, complainyng, covetousness, ambicion, and deceit, lay in wait
to kyl the lord of ye whole law, who alone was free in all things, and
clearly pure from all sin. Therefore upon this the lords answer, every one
knowing himself guilty, and being afraid lest he should be bewraied and his
faults disclosed, went out of the temple one after another: the seniors, the
Phariseis, the Scribes, the Priests, and other head men going before, and the
rest following them. For they which among that sort were taken for the very
pillars and mainteiners of religion and justice, were even sowsed in mormities,
and inwardly most great sinners: When these folks were goen out, of whom
never one was clear and without fault, Jesus remained alone, who only was
without fault. And now the synful woman found him, which never had done
sin, a merciful judge, whereas she should have had them cruel murderers, who
were themselves guilty of grievous sins. Therefore the woman seeing their
cruelty, stood alone as a woeful sinner before Jesus that was alone: a woman
ready to perish, before a Savior: a sinful creature before the fountain of
all perfeccion and holiness. She quaked for fear even of a very conscience, but
the clemency of Jesus, which showed it self even in his countenance, put
her in good coumfort: and in the mean while our lord (as it were a man
occupied about an other thing) wrote upon the ground, so that the Jews (as it
well appeared) went a way, not as men afraied with the lords threathynges,
but condemned in their own consciences.

At length Jesus stood up, and when he saw that all were goen and the
woman all alone and fearful, he speak courteously unto her, saying: woman
where, are thine accusers? has any man condemned the? She answered: no man si^.
He said unto her: woman where are thine accusers?
Then Jesus said, neither will I that came to save all men, be more
unmerciful then they, nor condemn her whom they have not condemned. The
rigor of the law does punish, to fear men: the fauourablenesse of the
gospel seeks not the death of a sinner, but rather his amendment and life.
Therefore go thy way and sin no more hereafter. By this example our lord
Jesus taught those that takes upon them to be shepeherdes over the people, and
to be teachers of the gospel, how great sufferaunce and gentelnesse they
ought to use toward them, Go and sin no more.
which fall into sin by frailty: for considering that he, in whom was no
sin at al, showed himself so merciful toward an open sinner, how great
ought the bishops gentilnes to be toward offe^ders? when as they themselves
have many times more need of Gods mercy then they, against whose faults they
be very angry: or in case they be not so synful, certes their life is not
without some spotte: at least way truly they may by the frailty of man,
fall into all kind of sin.

Therefore now when they which complained of the woman, were sent away and
every man brought to the knowledge of his own sin, and the sinner dismyst,
Jesus upon this occasion goes in hand again to make an end of the sermon
which he had begun. Sin is darkness. They that be true and of plain
meaning, and study not to be thought other manner of folk then they be, go
to the light, and are delivered out of darkness, like as the sinful woman
went unto Jesus. And because she did not deny, but confessed the thing that
she had committed, she went a way justified. Contrary wise the head men and
the Phariseis, because they would be thought righteous, when as in very deed
they were ungracious, and very wicked, dedde from the light, lest their
disease should be known, and so they made whole. Therefore Jesus does exhort
all folk, yt whosoever is be wrapped in sin, should come to him, but so that
he come penitente: and should rather follow him then the Phariseis, who being
blind, were guydes of the blind. And lest any man through knowledge of his
sins, should not be bold to come unto him, I am the light of the world. etc
he taught us in the aduoutresse a little before, how he rejected no man that
desirethe to be healed. I am (sayethe he) that to the whole, not to Palestine
alone, which the sun in the firmamente is to all the world: as much to
say, I am the light of the world. The sun taken away makes all things
dark withal. It bears light before all bodies: I am light to pure souls.
It gives life and likynge to all bodies: I am light more presently to souls.
He that walks in the light of the sun, stumblethe not in the dark: whosoever
folowethe me and believes on my doctrine, shall abide no longer in darkness of
error and sin* but being purged from sin and illumined with the doctrine
of the gospel, shall have the true light which gives life to the soul. It
belongs to the dead to be hid in darkness, Thou bear record of thy self.
and the property of them that be alive is to walk and be co^uersant in the
light. To have knowledge of me, is the life of the soul. Contrary, sin, and
to be ignorant of me, is eternal death. The Phariseis envy could not broke
this magnificence which Christ preached of himself, specially forasmuch as
they thought themselves to be touched covertly, and whatsoever did redound
unto Jesus commendacion and praise, the same to be a derogacion to theirs. And
furthwith therefore they cried out against him, in the presence of the
multitude, fearyng lest the common people would forsake them and follow Christ:
and to bring him out of credence, they would make him a liar, and charged him
therewith. Thou (they say) bear record and speak stoutly of thy self,
but no man's own record is to be believed. It is no true man's part, but a
proud man's fashion, to set forth his own praise: wherefore this thine own
testemonye is not true. To this vengeable check (which yet in deed could not
so much hurt his glory, as it might hinder the salvation of that great
nombre of people) Jesus made a sharp answer, saying: Truth it is, among
men the witness of him which both may deceive and be deceived, is of small
importance, and weyeth little.

I alone am not witness to my self, who can bring for me John's record, and
the witness which the prophets bare of me, yea and though there were no
man's record of me, who stand in no need of it. For if I alone should bear
witness of my self, yet could not you (in case ye knew plainly who I am and
whence I came) reprove mine own record. It is expedient that those men's
witness be drawn in question and doubted of, which (being nothing else but
very men, and according to man's judgment make relacion of themselves,) may be
deceived, and also lie if they list: but these things has that way no place
in me. For I speak nothing of mine own head, but the thing that I say,
cummeth of him from whom I was sent: and I have none other prete^se therein,
but to set forth his glory. He cannot lie, and his only record is more holy
and vncorrupt then all men's witnesses. Whosoever has pro^eded from him, But
ye can not tell whence I am.
and speaks all things according to his mind, within a while to return
again unto the same person from whence he came, has no need of man's witness:
when as his own propre acts are in redines to declare who he is. But you
being blinded with envy, of purpose will not know the thing that ye might
know: and because ye judge peruerslye of me through thestimacion that ye have
of those things which are in me, and other mortal men indifferently, and
common to both, ye do not perceive from whence I came, nor whither I shall go.
For this is not seen except men's minds (wicked affeccions set aside) do
judge after the spirit, and in ready belefe of minds, learn by the things
which I do and speak (with co^ferryng together the sayings of the prophets)
to see that it is an heavenly thing, and no worldly thing. But you judge after
the flesh: I judge no man, and if I judge, my judgment is true.
and why? because ye be corrupted with worldly affeccion, condemning wickedly
to your own utter destruccio^, that thing which ye ought to embrace to
eternal salvation. Your judgment therefore is corrupt and false, because it
cu^meth not of God, but out of worldly and human lusts. And in the mean
time do I judge no man. For the time of judgment is not yet, but of salvation.
And yet if I should give judgment of you my judgment should be true, because
it does not swerve and dissent from Gods judgment. For I should not give
sentence alone, but I and my father who sent me, ioyntelye together should
pronounce semblably one thing, forasmuch as we both throughlye will all one.
In worldly matters the judgment of many weyeth more, and is of greater
authority then one man's mind alone: but yet Gods judgment alone, passes
the judgment of all mankind. If ye despise my sentence as but man's judgment,
truly ye cannot contemn the judgment of God, though he himself alone give
judgment. And if ye do not despise the judgment of God, neither can ye
reiecte or refuse my judgment, which is consentyng to his in all things,
except with a common contempt ye do us both at once wrong: both him that
sends, and me that am sent from him. I speak or do nothing but that which
he has commanded me.

Semblably even amongst men the record of many is more substauncial then of
a few: and after your law there is no record, unless it be of two at least,
allowed and admitted before a judge. But yet in deed it is more to be regarded
if a man bear record of another, then if he bear witness of himself.
Howbeit it cannot be avoided but among men there be wrong judgments, and
untrue records: yea and although a thousand men should agree upon one thing
being but men, either for because through error they knew not the truth, or
else because they being corrupt in their affeccions, do not pronounce and give
sentence according to the true judgment of reason, but after the le^de
affeccions of the heart: Notwithstanding where even one alone says any thing
of himself, in case he do not pronounce the thing which he r^porteth of
himself, as of his own head, but by Gods commandment, his judgment and
record must needs be true, because God can neither be deceived nor corrupt.

I bear no witness of my self, but by the authority of my father, who does
also himself bear witness of me: neither do I pronounce any other thing
concerning mine own person, then he has testified who sent me into the world
to be a witnesse^ of the truth, which only he has known. If ye do put away
my record, ye must needs therein also reiecte his. If ye infringe and repel my
judgment, ye must of force and necessity contrary him. We be twain, but we
two have all but one witness and judgment. And there is one of these twain
who if he were alone, yet were his judgment not to be replied against. And if
ye ask when did the father testify of me, forsooth he bare record of me, in
your law: whose voy^e ye should know, if ye would with pureheartes understand yt
which is written: he did also testify of me at Iordane, his record of m^ is
to be seen in the very arts and deeds which he does by me: and in conclusion
when time shall be, he shall glorify me with more evident and clear witnesses.
After these things were spoken, the Jews because they heard the father often
named, from whom he was sent, and whose authority he laid for his defense,
meruailed if he would speak so highly of Joseph the carpenter, whose son he
was then commonly thought to be. And in case he meant not of him, they be
desirous to get out of him who should be that other father, from whom he had
come, and to whom he should go: Where is (quod they) this thy father, of whom
thou speak such wonderful things: But Jesus somewhat opening that as yet
he was not known unto them, touching his divine nature and Godhead, when as
they supposed him to be but a very man and naught else: and yet for all that they
should have believed him as a man unless their judgment had been corrupted with
carnal affeccions, yea and his words did also implie that neither the father
could truly be known, but by the son, nor the son fully known except the
father were known: for the son is not known with bodilye iyes but by faith,
nor ye father can be showed to man's se^ses, but may be brought into devout
minds spiritually. Well, Jesus (I say) makes answer on this wise: Ye neither
know me, nor yet my father: and so long as ye will not know me, ye can not
know my father. Give credence unto me, and ye shall both know me, and my
father. Ye say that ye know me, because ye know my country, my dwelling
place, my pare^tes, and brethren: When as through these words, which they
understood not, our lord Jesus did sore provoke the phariseis minds against
him, teaching openly in the temple, yea and where most preace of people was, in
a place of the Temple called the treasury (because that offringes and things
given to the Temple were brought thither, and kept there, which things wholly
were turned to the priests and Phariseis pleasures, and gain excessiuely,
though the things were given, and as ye would say were consecrate to God.)
Albeit I say that Christ did thus, as I have said, yet no man laid hands on
him: not because they lacked any ungracious will, but because God did not
suffer them to do it. For the time was not yet come, when as Christ had
appointed himself to suffer, neither would he suffer until he had fully
taught that doctrine which the father had committed to his ministracion, for
the salvation of man.

Therefore whiles they were whisht and kept silence, yet cumpassyng in mind full
ungracious and murderous thoughts, Jesus went forth with his talk privily
pricking their consciences, that so at least wa^ it might forthinke them, when
as they knew that nothing was hid unto him: a thing which was never before
given to him that was but a very man. No man's wickedness, (says he can
let the thing that I do by my fathers commandment. That thing once finished,
I go to him that sent me, and then ye shall seek me all in vain, and in mine
absence ye shall desire me, whom being present, you envy, and do displeasure
unto. Then ye shall know by the end and conclusion of the matter, who I am:
Ye shall wyshe my presence, and not have it. But you which do now persecute
the preacher, and setter forth of eternal trueth^ shall dye in your sin if
ye do persiste and continue in your infidelity. For he does perish through
his own fault that obstinately puts away health when it is freely
offered unto him: and he provoke and sekethe his own death, whosoever does
despise the fountain of life. I go not thither, whereas your wickedness
compels me, but I do willynglye go thither where as ye cannot follow me. By
this parable our lord Jesus did mean many things: first of all, that of his
own good will he went to his death, furthermore yt by his death and
resurreccion he should be lyfted up to heaven, whither as no man by any worldly
wisdom could be brought. When with this saying ye Jews were made afeard, and
understood not what he meant, they durst not for all that ask the meaning: but
whispered and talked thereof secretly among themselves saying: What is the
matter that this man doethe sundry times threaten us with his going away
thither, whither we cannot follow him? will he violently kill himself, and so
withdraw him from us? Jesus, which knew the very thoughts of them all, did
so temper and moderate his answer unto this very gross muttrynge and sinful
murmuryng, that the thing which he spoke should not be understand, but
after his death, resurreccion, and ascencion. For they supposyng that Jesus was
nothing else but a man, could conjecture none other thing, but that he should
go to his death, and so be delivered from the grefe of his persecutours, when
as his meaning was that himself (as touching his godhede) came from heaven,
and that he should anon after overcome death: and return again thither from
whence he came. Ye (sayethe he) being of this world are worldly wise, and
speak after the carnal judgment of the world. If ye believe not that I am he,
ye shall dye in your sins
I am not of this world, and do speak hyer things then you can understand,
neither shall ye ever understand them except ye leave your infidelity, and
show your selves ready to be taught, and therefore I told you erwhile and now
tell you once again, that unless ye put away your malice ye shall dye in your
sins. The only way to escape the darkness of sins, is to receive the
light. The only way to life, is to know him which only delivers from
death by the faith of the gospel. And in case ye do obstinately-refuse to
believe that I am he, by whom the father wills that all men should obtain
life and salvation, ye shall through your own fault dye in your sins.

Neither yet did this saying of the lord Jesus settell down into the minds of
the Phariseis, so very much had the inordinate love of this world blinded
their minds, and therefore as though they had neither seen nor heard any
thing whereby they might know who he was, they now maliciously say unto Jesus:
who art thou? but Jesus knowing before hand that they would pick some quarrel
against whatsoever answer he should make, which asked him ye question of a
froward mind, therewith also iudgeyng them to be more fit to hear what
themselves were, then what he was, makes them answer on this wise, saying:
Ye desire to know who I am, well then, do believe, but surely ye shall not
believe except ye put away gross and worldely affeccions, for else if I do
tell you who I am, I shall tell it to your harm. For ye will not only be
never a deal better thereby, but forasmuch as ye be many ways evil, ye
shall so much the more be made wurse. And this that I now speak unto you,
shall make your damnacion the greater. I thyrst and covet the salvation of men
and not their utter destruction. Or else I could speak many things of you,
and for many causes condemn you. But it is not so thought good to my father,
who sent me into the world, not to cause the evil to be wurse, but to
the intent that those which be evil should forthinke and amend themselves, and
be saved. The father that sent me is he that says truth, if ye believe him ye
shall be saved. And ye shall believe him, if ye will believe me: of truethe ye
shall without danger safelye believe me that speak nothing unto you, but what
as I have heard of my father, with who^ I was before I came into the world. He
has commanded me to speak true things, and the truth of such things as
do further me^ to salvation, and not to damnacion. And if any man do perish,
he shall perish through his own fault, who does envy his own health that
is offered him.

But the blyndnes of the Jews was so gross, that although he had so often
made mention of his father, from whom he was sent, and to whom he should go,
of whom he should have record, and did hear the things which he did speak,
as yet for all that it understood not that he spoke of the father of heaven,
because they could believe nothing in him above a man. For these sayings
were then as seeds closed up in the memory of the hearers, They understood
not yt he spoke of his father.
to thintente that they should then bring forth fruit, when as all things
should be fully accomplished, which the Prophets had written of Jesus. It was
expediente that as yet he should be thought a very man, until he had fully
finished for ye salvation of the world, that hye sacrifice which was to be
offered upon the alter of the cross. For it so pleased the father, that by
death God should be glorified. Our lord Jesus in the mean time meaning
this, goes forth in his communicacion, insinuating covertly that he should
afterward willinglye be crucified by them, and says thus: When ye shall
lift up on hye the son of man, even very then ye shall understand who I am:
and after that ye shall think me utterly made away, then in conclusion ye
shall well know my power. For ye shall right well perceive that the thing is
wrought, not as men do things, but by my fathers power: after whose pleasure
and judgment I do what thing soever I do practice herein earth, to the
salvation of man. Neither do I speak any thing but according to his mind. And
albeit I am sent into the world from him, yet am not I forsaken of him, he
has not left me, but he is always present with me, and does assiste me, and
by me, he both works and speaks unto you, for between us two is a most hye
consent: he is glorified by me, and I again by him: but he is the auctor and
I the messenger. And I do the office of an ambassador so faithfully, that I
always do those things which he has commanded and determined. Moses and
David, whom ye have in great reverence, spoke and did many things according
to Gods will, but yet the same did many times offend him with their doings. I
never dissent from that which is my fathers pleasure.

As he spoke these words, many believed on him. Then said Jesus to those
Jews which believed on him: If ye continue in my word, then a^^ ye my very
disciples^, and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
They answered him: We be Abraham's seed, and were never bound to any man:
sayeste thou than, ye shall be made free^ Jesus answered them: Uerely verily I
say unto you, that whosoever commits sin, is the servant of sin. And
the servant ^^^deth not in the house for ever, but the son abides ever. If
the son therefore shall make you free, then are ye free in deed. I know that
ye are Abraham's sede, but ye seek means to ^^l me, because my word has no
place in you. I speak that which I have seen with my father, and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father. When as at that season none did fully
understand these sayings, yet there was many among the people which thought
them not ungodly. And diverse conceyuyng good hope of the things which Jesus
promised them, believed him, If ye continue in my word, etc.
but yet not perfitly, for they were still ignoraunte, but as they were then
able to understand the doctrine of the gospel. There was in deed a certain
way prepared to faith already: although they were not yet so far forward as
they should be brought afterward. The Lord Jesus therefore does exhort them
to persevere in the thing wherein they were metely well entered, until they might
atteyne the perfyte knowledge of him. For faith of good men does eue^ believe
those things which it understands not. And the tru^th shall make you free.
The malice of the Phariseis waxed always wurse and wurse. He says unto them:
take you no exaumple at these which do wilfully perish, it is a good beginning
for you, some deal to believe my sayings, from which if other men's infidelity
do not withdraw you, and if ye will firmly abide in that year entered unto, I
which do profess heavenly truth and no Pharisaicall doctrine, will take you
for my very own proper disciples. And you which hitherto have embraced the
shadows of Moses law for truths, shall in process of time know all truth.
And the known truth shall make you free.

But the Jews not perceiving that Christ mente of that liberty which the
gospel teaches, which liberty does not change any worldly advancement, as
to deliver the body from the intereste that the master has over it, but
sets the mind at liberty from sin, from leude and worldly desires, from
the tirannye of the devil, from fear of death, from bondage of Pharisaicall
ordinances, from the yoke of carnal obseruyng of the law: The Jews I say,
not understanding this, makethe answer disdaynefully: for they were proud of
the nobility of their carnal aunceters. We, say they, by succession come of
Abraham the Patriarche, and are naturally free men borne, and not only free
but noble gentlemen also, neither did we ever serve any man as bo^de men. What
liberty therefore do thou promise us as though we were bond servants,
needful of manumission? This answer declared the Jews to be gross, which
put their affiaunce and glory in carnal things, neglecting spiritual
things which commend us to God.

They took pureness to consiste in wasshyng of the body, of cups, and of
vessels, though they had their soul polluted with sinful vices. They despised
other in comparison of themselves, because they were bodily circumcised, when
as they had an uncircumcised mind. They thought themselves holy because they
carried about with them the law written in broad scrolles round about their
head, when as they be holy to God, which have the law written in their
minds, and express the same, not in scrolles, but in their deeds. So now
they were proud in heart because after the flesh they came of Abraham, as
though it were a great matter to be borne of holyones, when before God they be
noble and famous, which, of whosoever they be borne, do express the
conditions of holy men in their manners. Therefore when Jesus had reproved them
for two causes, both because they were ignorant in the truth, and also
because they served as bondemenne: they dissembled the first, and stomaked the
less weyghty matter: for ignorance of the truth is a fault of the mind, to
be a servant is no evil thing of the mind, but a lack of worldly
fortune. Now therefore our Lord Jesus teaches plainlye what servitude he
meant: You says he, disdain that I prom^^e liberty, because in your own
co^ceyte ye be free, that is to say, the natural ^^ee children of Abraham:
but there is an other kind of servitude much more vile and miserable,
Whosoever commits sin. etc.
from which no noblenes of aunceters, be it never so great, can clay^ie
fredome and make a man free. Ye have not a man to your lord, from whose
bondage ye are to be made f^e, but hereof I do wellassure you, whosoever
sins, makes himself servant to sin, and loses his fredome: he is
verily a natural borne frema^ that is subject to no dishonestie, nor guilty of
sinful vilanye. This is the fredome, whereof ye may worthily rejoice before
God. But whosoever is addicte to sin has the devil his lord, and is moved
and drawn at his plea^re and arbitremente: although he may dayme k^nne and
can bring his pe^igrue to most holy aunceters.

For an other man's holiness takes not away the bondage of them that succeed in
blood, but every man is taken and esteemed after his own deeds: a servant can
not make his fellow servant that is also sinful as he is, partaker of his
fredome: but he only makes men free and s^tteth at liberty, which only is
void of all sin. For albeit a servant do for a time certain things in the
house, yet because he is a servant and no heir, he has no perpetuity or
enterest there for ever, but is put out of the house when it pleases the
master: but because the son is heir and Lord of the house, he has
continual right in the house, nor he himself only is free in deed without
all servitude, but he may also make other folk free. If ye therefore desire
this freedom, there is no cause why ye should look to have it of Moses, or
from the Patriarchs, or your priests, whose ministracion was for a while:
neither was any of these vttrely void of all sin, nor had authority to
abolishe or put away sins, ne yet did any of them know the truth exactely
and at full. But if the^^ son make you free. etc
But if one cleave fast to the son (to whom is given the whole and perpetual
power of the house) the same, of whatsoever stock he be borne, may well hope
to have true fredome.

Therefore Abraham did not begette us free, Moses did it not, the Priests did
not with their sacrifice make us free. If the son shall make you free from
error and sin, ye shall be truly and fully free.

You stand much in your own conceyte because ye be the sons of Abraham. I
know that ye be borne of Abraham as touching the flesh, but this honor is but
small, usual, and common to al Jews. If ye will algates be thought to be
Abraham's posterity, and children of a most holy father, nothing degenerate,
in your deeds declare you to be his sons. For it is ye property of a very
true natural child, to resemble and express the fashion and manners of his
parents. Abraham did so much believe God, that where as there was promised him
of God a populouse succession, and great in number, to come of his son Isaac,
he doubted not at one commandment of God to ^lea his son Isaac.

I speak yt which I have see^, etc.
But ye see now how far ye be of, from the manners of your father, which do
your endeavor to kill even me for no cause else, but that you being blinded with
desires of the flesh and the world, do not understand my communicacion and
words which be spiritual. Abraham not doubtyng of the promyses, did in a
thing against nature, believe the aungel by whom god spoke unto him. To me whom
ye se, and by whom god speaks to you, promising greater things then in times
paste he did to Abraham, ye do not only not give credence, but also
maliciously seek and devise my death. Do not therefore arrogantly challenge
Abraham to be your father. Every our is before God ye son of him, whose acres
and conditions he folowethe. For as the children sees their parents do at
home, so will they do, and grow to be of like affeccion and manners. I prove
both by words and deeds that I am his son from whom I was sent: for I
speak that which I have seen and heard of my father. You likewise do the
things which you have seen your father do.

They answered and said unto him: Abraham is our father. Jesus says unto
the^: If ye were Abraham's children ye would do the deeds of Abraham, but now ye
go about to kill me, a man that has told you the truth* which I have heard
of God: this did not Abraham. Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they
unto him, we were not borne of fornicacion, we have one father, even god. Jesus
said unto them: If God were your father, truly ye would love me, for I
proceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of my self, but he sent me.
Why do ye not know my speech? Even because ye cannot abide the hearing of my
word. Ye are of your father the d^uill, and the lusts of your father will ye
serve. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,
because: here is no truth in him: when he speaks a lie, he speaks of his
own, for he is a liar, and the father of the same thing. And because I tell
you the truth, therefore ye believe me not. Forsomuche as the Jews took this
saying of our Lord Jesus in evil part, they frame their answer in such
sort, that they go about therein to pick out of Jesus words some thing
spoken to Abraha^s rebuke: which thing if it had been so in deed, they would
have provoked the people to have stoned Christ: for where as he had openly
testified that their deeds were evil, and added further that they did those
things which they had seen their father do (neither did they knowledge any
other father then Abraham) they took it as if by this saying of Jesus, Abraham
the Patriarche had been reproved, who had himself been such one as were the
children that came of him. But Jesus spoke nothing sore at all against Abraham,
but reasoned contrary to their saying, proving that therefore they were not the
children of Abraham, because they were most far from his ways, If ye were
Abraham's children. etc.
and most unlike him. If ye will, says he, be taken for the true children of
Abraham do as your father did: believe Gods word. For he of truth through
notable affiaunce in God, deserved the comme^dacio^ of righteousness, and was
called righteouse. Now although ye have never done boastyng Abraham to be your
father, nevertheless your study and drifte is to kill me, a man that albeit I
were none other but very man, yet were I innocent and one that harm no man,
and you therefore would ^lea me, because I tell you the truth, which I do
not feign of mine own head, but that truth which I have heard of God:
insomuche that whosoever distrusteth me, the same must needs distruste God. But
Abraham will not acknowledge you for his sons which go about a wicked
matter, and much disagreable to his manners. And if it be so that every one is
that man's son, whose deeds he follows, and that your deeds withal are far
unlike to Abraham's, you must needs have some other father, whosoever he be,
whose natural disposicion you do resemble, and show your self like in
conditions. The Jews being of truth more provoked by these sayings, now
(as it were) geassing to what end the process of Jesus words tended, and
whom he noted to be their father, answer: whom else apointest thou for our
father, that take away our father Abraham?

We be not base gotten, we may rejoice in that which is common to all the
Jews, who are not only the succession of Abraham, but also the sons of God,
which calls Israel his first begotten child. And we are Israelites. And if
thou take away our father Abraham from us, If god we your father
if thou give us another father then God, the common father of all our nation,
thou art not only iniuriouse and dispiteful to us, but to the whole nation of
the Jews. Whereas this was a wicked and shameless answer (for what could be
more shameful the^ to boaste themselfes to be the children of God, who knew
themselves giltye in such great faults, who also laid in wayt to bring ye
son of God to death) Jesus replied sharply to this answer and said: If God
were your father, that is to wit, if ye were very true and natural
Israelites, ye would I am sure love me, as a brother and begotten of the
common father of all, and as one that does expressly follow his fathers
behaueour and manners, even as it becummeth a true natural child. For I
neither show forth any other thing then God the father, nor I do none other
men's busynes then my fathers, from whom I proceaded and came into this world.
For I neither speak nor do any thing of my self. I do not apoint my self to
this embassage but he sent me, whom ye claim to be common father to you all.

And if ye say truth, why do ye not acknowledge his speech, that is the same
fathers son, and his very true son, who was also with his father before he
came into the world, neither speaks he any thing but at his fathers
appointment? Why can ye so very evil bear my words when as by me, god
speaks unto you? If ye believe God to be true, beneficial, and an health
geuer, frendely to the^ that be godly, and enemy to the wicked, when as ye see
nothing in my sayings or doings unlike unto these things, why do you not
acknowledge the manners and very nature of your father? But if ye covet to
hear your fathers name, whom in wit and deeds ye do rese^ble: ye be neither
beegotten of Abraham, nor of God, but even of the devil: ye be his very
natural children, whose wit and disposicion ye breathe out and show
likelyhoode of, and whose will ye obey. For ye have both hated the truth, and
go about to kill an innocent. This is an exaumple of the devil your father.
For because he has been the chief auctor of both lies and murder, who by his
lying entised unto death the first parents of mankind, being with none
other thing provoked then through envy of other folks felicity. And the same
sinful disease does prick you forward to slay one that is innocent, and a
beneficial person. The devil enuyed man, that was of a blessed creacion, ye
envy man to be restored unto the felicity from whence he fell. He fell from
the truethe by his pride. And his fall was such that there is no hope of his
amendment, but persistyng in evil, he heapeth sin upon sin striving
against Gods verity by you at this present, and doing the same thing that in
the beginning of the world he first practiced, when he drew the first
auctors of mankind unto death Whosoever therefore hates truth and loves lies, he
declares sufficiently who is his father. Whosoever pronounces a lie, he
speaks of him that is the fountain of all lies. Whatsoever that auctor
speaks is a lie, and he speaks of himself for he is not only a liar, but
the father and prince of lies. As of the contrary side, God is the fountain of
all truethe, and whosoever speaks the truth to Gods glory, he speaks not
of himself but of God.

But if you be begotten rather of God the auctour of truth, then of the devil
the father of lies, wherefore then (considering that I do speak unto you
heavenly truth,) do not you being the children of Abraham believe God? why do
not ye the children of God, acknowledge and love Gods truth?

If ye find any lie in my words or any fault in my procedyng, give not
credit to my words. But which of ye all can burden me with any one fault?
What manner of men ye be, ye your selfs are privy: but if whatsoever be right
and true, the same is of God, and neither can ye prove in me any thing that
varieth from right and truth, why then in not beleuyng me do ye distruste god,
specially considering that ye boaste your selves to be the children of God? But
and if ye did extolle and advance your selves truly, ye would acknowledge the
word of God, but in case ye do it vntruelye, ye declare your selves to have a
lying father.

He that is of god, heereth Gods words.
Whosoever is begotten of god, the same does (like a true natural child) give
ear to his fathers words. And that thing well proves you not to be begotten
of God the father, because ye cannot abide to hear the truethe that cummethe
from him. The Jews being made through these words more wood, fall to geuyng
cursed words in their answer, whereunto the malice of men being with reason
concluded is wont to have refuge, and says: Do not we say right of thee,
that where thou will be taken for a Jew, and boastest god to be thy father,
thou art a Samaritane, and haste the devil? which self thing, thou do now
declare in deed, and approuest our judgment of thee. But what answer made
most gentle Jesus unto this peuishe mad reproach? As touching the reproach in
namyng him a Samaritane although it were commonly taken for a great rebuke
and slander, yet because it was naught else but a fumishe check spoken in a
furye, he made no answer at all thereunto, as though they had but called him a
mushrome, or an oynion, but yet to the bearing him on hand that he had the
devil, he answers, but in such sort that he gave them no evil language
again, which he might worthily have done, and countermau^ded back again,
their lewd saying to themselfes, but auoydethe it courteouslye from himself:
teaching us by the way, that as often as we have to do concerning gods
glory, as often as the truethe of the gospel is to be defended against the
wicked, we should be earnest, quick and sharp: And as often as we our selfs
be rebuked, that we should show our selfs ^entle and meke. In such wise that
we do not make answer to all things, but repel and avoid those things
only from us, which we cannot concele without hinderaunce of the gospel.

To have the people understand that Christ did every thing in all his
procedynges, not by the deiuils authority, but God the father being aucthour,
made much to the furtheraunce of the gospel. I have says Christ, no
familiarity with any deiuill, nor I do not therefore boaste my self of God
being my father, to the intent that I would with a lie obtain mine own
praise, but that through me my father might be glorified emongst men. And
albeit ye do glory that ye have the same god to your father, yet do ye me
despite, who seek nothing else but his glory, of whom ye would be thought true
wurshippers.

I do not curiously seek mine own praise at men's hands, I seek not mine
own praise. etc.
neither does your contumeliouse words hurt me, but rather works your
destruction. For there is one, who as he is covetous to be glorified among
men by me, so he wishes that I again should have glory by him: not that
either he or I have need of this glory, but that so to have it is expediente
for you for the exchange of death, and that ye may attayn salvation. Of
truth, like as I do not much covet mine own glory (howbeit in deed my glory
is the glory of my father) so am I no revenger of mine own rebuke or injury.
But yet for all that think not that ye shall be without punishmente for that
ye have slaundered me. For there is he that both seeks my praise and glory,
and will revenge my injury and contempt, except ye amend.

To glory in names, as ye do, profits nothing, for in that sort neither
Abraham, the original beginning of your stock, nor Moses, nor the Priests,
nor the Pharisees, ne God the father, shall do you any good. Be ye well assured
hereof, if any man obey my words (as I have said often) he shall never see
death, only belefe is the way and entry to immortality. Although the Jews
ought with this so caulme and gentle an answer to have been appeased, and with
this so great a reward to have been allured unto faith, yet according to their
rudeness, do they interpretate that thing which was spiritually spoken of
life of the soul, to be spoken of bodily life, and that which was told them
for their instruccion, they sediciously mar and frowardly turn into the
reproach of the Patriarchs, studyng every way to procure some hatred against
our Lord Jesus among the multitude. They answer verily in this manier. We
have also of that thy saying more certain knowledge that thou art possessed with
a deiuill wood and frantike, which promisest this thing to them that keep thy
word, which manier of thing our Patriarchs, men of most high praise,
never had* unto whom God himself spoke. God spoke unto Abraham, as he did
also to other Prophets. They were obedient to Gods word, and nevertheless
they be all dead, and thou promiseste perpetual life to them that observe
those things which thou teach. What make thou thy self?


With what countenance or how dareste thou be bold to promise other that
thing which thou haste not thy self? Doeste thou promise immortality to
other, being mortal thy self? Art thou greater then our father Abraham
which is dead? Yea and moreover the Prophets also be all dead. They durst
promise no such thing to any man. How highly do thou presume of thy self?
Whom make thou thy self? Thou preferreste thy self before the Prophets,
and Abraham, and in promising that thing which is gods, thou make thy self
god.

The Lord Jesus did so moderate his answer unto these fond peuyshe
reproaches, wherewith the Jews taunted him, that because they were not yet able
to receive so great a mystery, he did of truth somewhat by insinuacion open
that he was greater then the Prophets, and Abraham himself too: and that he
was one that might perform by Gods power that thing which he did promise, yet
he would not appear arrogant among the ignoraunte. But he tempered his
sayings lest he should kyndle more wrath in them that were moved already,
and says: I attribute nothing untruly to my self. For if I should after
the manner of men seek for praise at man's hand, then were my praise false
and vain. And in case I were curiouse to seek for praise and glory, it were
not needful to hunte for it amongst men. For it is my father, from whom all
true glory cummeth, that glorifyeth me. He that is honored of him, It is my
father which honors me etc.
the rebukefull words of men do not dishonor the same. And if ye will
algates know him that is my father, it is very he whom ye boaste to be both
your God and father. Whose children if ye were in deed, forsothe ye would
recognyse his ambassador, and if ye were true wurshippers of him, ye would
favor his glory, and not bring him in contempt whom he sent into the world
for your salvation. But as ye wurshippe him with false religion, so ye untruly
claim unto you the knowledge of him. He is spiritual, and you favor and know
nothing else but carnal things. I who am his very son in deed, do verily
know him, which thing I do not of arrogancye untruly challenge, but I say
that which is true: and if I should say I know him not, I should be a liar,
and like unto you that profess the knowledge of God whom ye know not. I am
sent from him and was with him before I came into the world. Therefore I know
him, and what thing soever he has commanded me, I do it. But whosoever
contemns my word contemns god, in whose name I exercise the commission of
his embassage, and that faithfully. And whosoever despyseth gods word, he
neither knows God nor takes him as God.

Furthermore whereas ye never cease braggyng of your father Abraham to whom
ye be most far unlike, and that ye procure hatred unto me, for that I take
my self to be Abraham's better, verily I do neither vainly boaste mine own
greatness, nor diminishe his dignity. This I will now say unto you, that
Abraham whom you do rather wonder at then follow, how great a man soever he
was, yet he was glad and thought he should be happy if it might be his luck to
see my day. And he saw that thing which he desired, and that great man
greatly ioyed to have my day chance to him, and yet you contemn me. Jesus
did herein and by this strange saying, signify that when Abraham made
himself ready to offer in sacrifice his son Isaac, he saw by the spirit of
prophecy that our Lord Jesus should be given of his father unto the death of
the cross, for the salvation of the world: and yet should not through that
death utterly peryshe, but within three days after revive again to an
immortal life. The Jews not yet understanding this mystery, do now again
according to their carnal judgment, fall in hand with checking: supposyng
Jesus to be no another thing then man, nor that he had any being before he was
borne of Mary. Thou art not yet (say they) fifty years old, and haste thou
seen Abraham that died so many hundred years ago? Finally the Lord Jesus as a
man provoked with their opprobrious words, some deal opens, and as it were
utters a little spark of his Godhed through which he knows no time nor
number of years, but was always all one before all course of time, like as God
the father being without the limits of time alwaie is that he is. For thus he
speaks unto Moses. I am that I am: signifyinge an eternalitie, and a nature
that cannot change. And in like manner the son using the words of his
father, says: This I do assuredly confirm unto you (though as yet ye will
not believe it) or ever Abraham was borne, Than took they up stones to cast
(...) him.
I am. At these words as plain blasphemous, because he being a mortal man
seemed to take upon him the eternalitie, a thing for God only convenient, they
could not withholde their hands, but took up stones, and went in hand to
overthrow and press him with stones. But Jesus professyng himself to be God,
to declare himself to be a very man also, gave place to their fury, not
because he feared their forcible violence, which he had power to keep of, but
to teach us by the way that when time requires that the truth of the
gospel should be preached valiantly and boldly, and again, that when we had
once executed our duty, the fury of evil men should not causeless and in
vain be provoked and exasperate: for our Lord Jesus knew that it could not
have been beat into the heads, I will not say of the gross and ignoraunte
multitude, but not of his disciples: and they to be brought to belefe thereof,
in case he had openly preached himself to be both God and man, and the same to
be all at once both mortal as touching his manhed, and also immortal as
touching his deity: and as perteyning to the flesh to be a man borne of a
virgin in time, as touching divine power to have been always before all time
God of God. Surely this so secret a mystery was rather to be at time
conueniente persuaded to the world by miracles, death, resurreccion, ascendyng
to heaven, and by the inspiracion of the holy ghost, then before due time to
be brought in, and uttered in open plain words to them that would not belue
it. Therefore Jesus withdrewe himself from them, geuyng place to their fury,
and went secretly forth of the temple: by that act declaryng beforehande,
that afterward the light of the gospel being repelled of the wicked and
voluntary blind Jews, should be put over to the Gentiles, and their house
left to them desolate which only thought themselfes the true servants of God,
and obseruers of true religion. And so Jesus which is the author of true
godliness, went to an other place.

The.ix. Chapter.

Therefore our Lord Jesus did now for a while give place to the fury of them,
whom as yet he saw incurable, and falls in hand with miracles to declare
his Godly power, which he could not all this while drive into their headdes
by any persuasion of words. And lo there fell forthwith a matter in his way
not unlike those things which were done in the temple. For of truth much a
do was there with the blind. But such as were blind in soul, not in body,
which is the most unhappy kind of blyndnesse. And so much also the wurse,
as that although they were more then blind, yet they thought themselves quick
sighted, so that they were not only miserable, but also unworthy to be cured.
For so much as miser was not that blind man whom Jesus saw as he passed by,
which man lacked only bodily sight, He saw a man which was blind.
and was borne blind, so that it was a malady above the Phisicions cure, but
yet could Christ heal it. This man had an inward sight, and saw with iyes
of the soul: when Jesus therefore saw the man, and had compassion on him, much
pitying his misery, the disciples which called to their remembrance that
Christ had said to the man that was healed of his palsy: Go, and hereafter
sin no more, lest some wurse thing come upon the, supposing that every
blemishe of the body had come of some fault of the soul, axed Christ of the
blind man, and said: through whose sin chanced it that this man should be
borne blind? for where as none could sin or he were borne, whosoever is
borne with any sickness or impediment of body, is to be thought punished for
some other man's fault, which thing should yet seem against equity, the
disciples therefore said: Master whence came so great evil to this fellow,
that he should be borne blind? Whether came it of his own or of the sin of
his parents? Jesus answered: Neither did this man through his own sin
deserve to be borne blind, who could not sin when as yet he was not: nor
his parents. For as the law teaches, God punysheth not the children for the
faults of their parents, except the children follow the sins of their
parents. But blyndnesse chanced to this man upon a casualtie (and not through
any man's sin) as in the course of man's life, many things chance to many
folk. This man's misery and lack of sight was not prohibit, but suffered to
chance unto him, because that by him the mighty power and goodness of God,
whom the blind Jews so obstinately cries out upon, should be declared to
me^. The more incurable the disease is, the more famous and commendable shall
be the healing of the same.

I must work the work of him that sent me, while it is day. The night
cummeth when no man can work. As long as I am in the world I am the light
of the world. As Soon as he had thus spoken, he spatte on the ground, and
made clay of the spettell and rubbed the clay on the iyes of the blind, and
laid unto him: Go wash the in the poole of Siloe, which (by interpretacion)
is as much to say as sent. He went his way therefore and washed, and came
again seeing. For this cause was I sent into the world eue^ to procure the
glory of God with such deeds, as should cause the unfaithful to believe my
words to be true, and to the intent also that those which will believe, should
be cured of their blindness. I must do this commandment diligently while it
is day: for if men have any work in hand, they be wont to do it in the
day. The night (perdy) is unhandsome to work in. Therefore in the mean time,
while prensent day gives us leave to work, we may not cease: For the night
shall come when as men (all in vain) would work and cannot. As long as I am
in the world, I am the light of the world. If men make speed to finishe the
work, which they go about for some commodity of this life, before night, how
much more behooves it every man to labor, that while they have me with them,
they may go through with the business of the eternal salvation. In favor
whereof, whatsoever (in the mean season) I do in this world, I do it for
that thing sake, and to further salvation. For what other thing do I, then
that all folk should, through iyes of faith, see and acknowledge God and his
son, whom he sent into the world: I shall within a while depart hence, than
shall those that have now had no will to work, desire light in vain. I am
the light of the world.
The Lord Jesus did with this saying, covertly notise unto them that were
present, that (al infid^litie set aparte) they should quickly go about to
believe the son of God, whom they could not long after see bodily. Moreover,
he did insinnate therwithall that those which otherwise could not be brought
to belief than by hearing him speak, and seeing him work miracles, should to
none effect desire to have him made away, whom they despised being present.
And at whose light, being obiecte to all men's sight, they shut their iyes.
Furthermore he signified likewise, that al such as of obstinate mind did
persist in wilful blindness of mind, should, when time were, as men
unrecoverable and without hope to be amended, be left to their own folly unto
eternal destruction, even when aduersaunte miserye is immynent and ready to
invade them, which calamity will rather cause them perish than heal them.
And over all this he did ensign them in time to come, a terrible judgment,
at what season the wicked shall covet to labor about business of their
salvation: And it shall not be lefull, for that the night will not suffer it,
for as much as they neglected the day in which they might have wrought: yet
for all this, every one while he is in state of this bodily life, and also
after Christ's ascencion into heaven, has this days light of the Apostles,
and of holy scripture, which gives ability to do the thing that
appertains to our salvation: But after the body be once dead, than is his
day away from him, nor it cannot work any thing more: but the reward of his
foredoen deeds is to be hoped upon and looked for. These diffuse sayings our
Lord Jesus than had, to quicken and prick forward with fear of the thing to
come, men that were slow to believe. But now, while the disciples looked for a
miracle, Jesus spatte on the ground, and of his spattle and duste mixed
together, he made clay, and he anointed the blind man's iyes with the clay,
even thereby resemblyng his fathers, or rather his own work, wherein he made
the first manne of hard clay, molified with licoure. And to restore that
which was lost, pertayneth to the same author, which first made the same
things of naught. And to purify or make whole again, a thing that is
corrupted, is of more power and strength, than to begette a thing that is not
borne. Well but in the mean time, the novelty of this plaster made all their
minds attentive and quietely to give head, and well to considre the miracle
that should be wrought, and it also proved a steadfast faith in the blind man,
which murmured nothing at him that anointed him, but simply obeys him that
does what himself list, doubtyng nothing at all of the benefyte, what way
so ever it should be given. The blind did not furthwith receive his sight, but
as soon as he was anointed with the clay, he is commanded to go to the poole
Siloe, and there to wash away the clay, wherewith his iyes were embrued, to
thentente that both the blind man's faithful affiaunce should be of greater
fame, for that he made no refusal to do that he was commanded, and that the
novelty of that strange sight, and also the delay which was through length
of the Journey, should bring furthmoe records of the miracle: for the blind
manne ^at not far of from the temple beggyng by the way side. And the well
Syloe whereof ryseth the poole, is at the foot of the mount Syon: of which
water Esaias speaks too and complayneth that that water was contemned, not,
that the water gives to any manne health, but because it bears the figure of
holy scripture. Which scriptures of God, when as without blusteryng of worldely
eloquence they issue forth caulmely and smoothely, yet because they bubble out
of the privy hid caves of godly wisdom, they have heavenly violence to remo^e
the blyndenesse of man's mind, how long soever it has continued and to open
those iyes wherewith God is seen, whom to have seen is felicity. For Syloe in
the Syrians tongue sygnifieth sent. For one there is even specially sent from
the father, which only gives light to men's minds, for he is the fountain.
It did represente Christ himself, who even at this present time also, being
as it were with a secret power enclosed in holy scripture, opens the iyes of
the blind, if so be that they will acknowledge their blyndenesse. He must be
made more then blind that will receive light of Christ. He that is wise to
the world, is very far of from hope of heavenly wisdom: he that thinks
himself well sighted, nor vouchesaueth to have his iyes closed up with the
clay of Jesus, there is no cause why he should hope for the light of the
gospel. Now than when the blind fellow, a notable known manne for his
beggyng, and known also to be borne blind, went thither as he was
commanded, no doubt but a great croude of people followed him as he went, not
without laughyng, to see his iyes blurred with clay: and so twice blind going
to a water which was of no name through any miracle that ever was done therein:
when they were come to the water, he washes away the clay from his iyes, and
returns home with open iyes and and clear sight.

but he is like him. He himself said, I am even he. Therefore said they unto
him: how are thine iyes opened? He answered and said. The manne that is
called Jesus, made clay, and anointed mine iyes, and said unto me: Go to the
poole S^loe and wash. and when I went and washed, I received my sight. Then
said they unto him: where is he? He said, I cannot tell. They brought to the
Pharisees, him that a little before was blind, and it was the Sabbath day, when
Jesus made the claye and opened his iyes. Neighbors therefore and other which
had known him before (neither could he but be well known to many,
considering he was a common beggar) when they knew his face, but as for his
iyes they saw altered, they said: Is not this he whom we saw sitting before
the temple, and begged by the way side? Some said: It is he. Other contrary,
it is not he, but it is an other like him. While they disagreed among
themselves, the blind himself said: Yes verily I am the same beggar, and he
that was borne blind, whom ye have often seen. And he thus said, that his
voice also being known, should cause the miracle be the better believed. But we
(say they) saw the blind: now see we the sea with open iyes. How chanced it
that thine iyes were shut, and now are open? The man (says he) that is called
Jesus, made claye, and therewith anointed mine iyes, and that done he said: go
thy way to the poole Siloe, and there wash thine iyes. I went my way, I
washed me, and now I see. They than sekyng occasion to pycke a quarrel to the
Lord Jesus, to put him to rebuke, because in tempering the claye and anointing
the iyes therewith, he sumwhat labored on the holy day, they enquire where he
was that did this deed. When the beggar had answered that he knew not who it
was, for he had not known Jesus by sight, but only by name, they bring him
which of a blind man was brought to his sight, unto the Pharisees, that by
showing the thing plainly before them, he should detecte Jesus that he had
broken the Sabbath day. For it was the Sabbath day when Jesus opened the
blind man's iyes.

There the Pharisees enquire of the manne once again how he came from being
blind to have sight. He casting no perils showed plainly how the matter was,
and said: he anointed mine iyes with claye that was tempered with spattle.
And upon his commandment I washed me in Siloe, and that done I received my
sight. Certain of the Pharisees when they heard this, said: this Jesus is
not of God, though he speak of God the father: for if he took God for his
auctour, he would not by doing such miracles violate the Sabbath which God
commanded to be kept. It is a detestable thing to break the holy Sabbath
day. God medleth not with such a one. So those maliciously faithless because
they could not deny so manifest a deed, nor reprove so beneficial a deed,
they borowe and make shift to have a quarrel against him at the holiness of the
day, other again that were more curable, says: if this man were not beloved
of God, or detestable before him for breakyng the Sabbath, how could he
work these miracles? The matter it self shows that these things are dooen
by the aid of God: Nor this is not now the first miracle that he has
wrought. After this sort was alteracion and sondrye opinions among them,
touching Jesus. Therefore the Phariseis, which by all assayes, took occasion to
reprove him, spoke yet again to the blind: What think thou (say they) of
him that opened thine iyes? The thing that they hunted for was this: that in
case he had spoken evil of Jesus (which thing the blind man knew was their
mind) they might have matter to lay against those which had merely good
opinion of Jesus: but and he had reported well by him, they would have been
fierce against the blind man self, and have cast him out of the Synagogue.
The beggar of truth simply and without dread spoke out what he thought of
Jesus. I take him (says he) to be a prophet, meaning by thatsame, some
great and notable man of whom he had both heard great fame, and had had also
experience of his power and strength in himself.

There were many Jews therefore, which could not be brought in belief, that
this was the same which late before sat beggyng at the door of the temple,
being borne blind, forsomuche as it did euidentlye appear that he now had
clear sight and open iyes. Therefore his father and mother were called for,
which could know their son even by some special mark. And here now the
malicious curiosity of the Pharisees set forward the belief and also the
commendacion of the thing that was done. Is this your son. etc.
Therefore they say to his pare^tes: Is this your son whom ye were wont to
say was borne blind? And how chanced it that now he sees? They (as in deed
such be timorous as have small substance at home) answer warely: The thing
(say they) which we certainly know, we can testify: We know that this is our
son, and that he was borne blind. But of the sight that is given him, we
neither know how it came, nor from whom, himself shall testify this thing
more assuredly than we can. He is old enough, ask him rather then us, let
him speak for himself that he knows. His parents had these sayings, not
as ignorant what had befalle^ upon their child, but they had leauer that he
alone should come in danger, than they to endaunger themselves with him: for
the Jews had already conspired, that if any man durst profess Jesus to be
Messiah, he should be excommunicate and cast out of the Synagogue, which
was taken for a matter among the Jews of great reproach, whereof it cu^meth
that even among the professers of the gospel, the sharpest kind of punishment
is, that if a man swerve from his profession and fall into an heinous crime, he
be removed from the fellowship of other, to the intent that he which cannot
be reformed by wholesome informacion, being eschewed of other, should be
better advised, and for very shame amend. But this exaumple of gentle
fierceness, which was fit to be exhibit upon them only, which through
their enormities should make themselves detestable and pestilente, the Jews
now turn to the establishement of their tyranny: like as they did also abuse
all other good ordinances to their own gain and pomp. The darte which
ought to have been hurled at the evil sort, to have healed them thereby,
rather than to have destroyed them, they turn the same weapon against them,
which profess Christ. The blind ma^s parents fearyng this thing, lays
upon their sons back, the envy that should rise of testifying the truth:
he is (say they) of sufficient age, ye may ask him.

Than he that had been blind, was called for again, to be his own witness
and advocate, and to be also a publisher of Christ's renoume, for it was
Christ's use to reuerse and turn the malice of the Pharisees, unto Gods
glory. For though the deed was more euidente, partelye by the record of the
pare^tes, and partly by ye act self, than that it could be cloked or denied,
yet to turn away the praise of that deed from Christ, whom they hated, they
say: That thou haste sight where before thou waste blind, do not ascribe it
to Jesus: unto whom thou art nothing beholden, Give God praise.
but praise god for this benefit. For we know that this fellow Jesus is a
sinner, who has no acquaintance with god. The Pharisees did their endeavor to
divide in sundre that which could not be separate, that is to wete, the glory
of the father from the glory of the son: and they spoke colourably, to hyde
their own iniquity with the pretense of hye godliness, as though they took
great care lest Gods honor should decay, when as in very deed they
sought their own praise in all things, and regarded not the praise of God.
The blind manne answeryng unto these sayings, both boldly and advisedly,
says: whether he be a sinner or no, let other men judge, it is not my part
to give sentence therein, one thing I can truly testify, I found in very deed
that I was before blind, and I now see: here now, when as no sufficient
occasion was given to the Pharisees, either to rebuke Jesus or to be cruel
against the man, which had spoken warelye and with good aduisement, they were
turned back again to their former interrogatories, driving driftes on every
side how to beriue Christ of his praise: what did he to the (say they) or by
what means did he open thine iyes? hoping that by a new manner of framing his
tale, they might pick out somewhat whereby they should persuade that this
praise was not due to Christ. Against this impudent and shameless malice of
the Phariseis the beggar being now well boldned, makes this answer: I told
you erewhile playnelye as the thing was done in deed, once ye have heard it. To
what purpose is it, to repete the same again? If ye do enquire of a pure simple
mind, well, I have already opened y^ matter, and with my record, I have
satisfied that which was demanded of me: and if ye do not so ask, it were
not indifferentelye dooen, eftesones to tell the same. Do ye therefore so
diligently enquire the manner of the deed, that after the matter be thoroughly
known, ye also will become his disciples, by who^ God works so great things?
like as I (upon experience of his power) and many other more are his disciples.

The Phariseis being sore provoked with the beggars great affyaunce, made no
answer, but all to rated him: wishing that thing to the manne as an extreme
evil, whereby themselves might be made blessed, and through abhominacion
putting back from them that thing, which ought to have been most heartily
desired, saving for that they were as blind in soul as the beggar being now
an euangeliste, was before in body: the Pharisees (I say) say unto him: O
thou ungracious wretch, be thou that naughtye fellows disciple. We that are
the disciples of Moses, with whom this Jesus is not to be compared, We are
Moses disciples.
do deteste and abhor such a master. For we be certain that god spoke to
Moses, and that whatsoever he teaches us, he has it at Gods hand to
teach. But why should we give ear to this Jesus, seeing we know not from
whence he came? leat him teach and prove unto us his authority, and
perchance we will believe him. The beggars courage and boldenes did in the time
of their reasonyng, grow and increase: And though he perceived that they by
all subtle means went about to destroy Jesus, yet did he stoutely (setting a
side all perils) plead Jesus cause, gathering and well prouyng by the miracle
that was wroughte in geuyng him his sight, that it was clear enough from
whence Jesus came. I marvel (says he) why ye say ye know not from whence
Jesus is, when as it cannot be denayed but that by him mine iyes be open: with
which (being shut and without sight) I was borne. Certes this is a thing
without controversy, neither do ye think the contrary, that God hears not
the desires of sinners. But if a man wurshippe him devoutly, and obeys his
will whom he religiouslye serves, him does God hear. But if God by Jesus
have taken from me my blyndnes, albeit the chief praise is to be given to god,
yet nevertheless it must needs be that he is a reuerente wurshipper of God, and
one that God loves, at whose desire and prayer God gave unto me so notable a
benefit. For it is no common or mean miracle which ye see wrought in me.
Many wondrous things are told of, which god long ago did by our elders, but
such as were holy and not sinners. But except this Jesus were come from God,
except the power of god were present with him, he could of himself do nothing
at all. It is not of man's strength wiche yet we see done.

The Phariseis being made extreme wood with this courage and boldness that the
beggar was of (and when there was no hope to be had that the poor fellow
would either be corrupted, or with fear astonished, and so cease of from
preachng Christ,) fall to extremity, and to say the uttermost they could. They
vpbrayed him with his old blindness, they cast him in the teeth with his
beggerlynesse, as though God had punished him therwithall for his sins, and
as though he were borne wicked and ungracious, that comes into the world
poor or blind, or otherwise bleamished in body. Thou (say they) art
altogether borne in sin, and teach thou us that know how to defend
religion, and uphold the profession of the law? dare thou here in the
presence of so great men teach divinity, which but a while a go asked alms?
neither did they suffer him to speak any longer. And being ashamed to be so
put to silence, and have their mouths stopped by a poor ignorant person:
they thrust him out of the Sinagogue as a leude masters leude disciple.

But whom Pharisaicall fiercenes thrusts out of the Sinagogue, them does
Christ receive into his church. For to be disseuered from the communion of
the wicked, is to be coupled to Christ. And to be disallowed of them, that
stablishyng their own righteousness, speak against the righteousness of
God, is to be approved and allowed: and of them to be rebuked, that seking
their own praise, go about to darken the praise of Jesus, is most hye
praise: and to be detestable to the^ that are to be detested, is to be derely
beloved of god. Therefore relacion was made unto Jesus how boldly the man that
so much set forth his praise, behaved himself toward the Phariseis. For it
was already bruted abroad by the people, that he was cast of and reject.
Therefore as soon as Jesus had met with him, to make this man's faith more
known to al men, he says unto him: how say thou fellow, beleuest thou on
the son of God? For he had already confessed before the Pharisees, that he
which did so great a thing came plainly from God. Nor Jesus was ignoraunte
thereof, but he gatte out the man's open confession thereof, for other men's
sakes, procuryng thereby a good exaumple for other. But though he that had been
blind, as yet knew not Jesus by sight, yet having great affeccion to know
that man's face, whom Jesus named the son of god, says: lord who is he?
that when I know him, I may believe on him? The manne had believed on Jesus,
yea ere he saw him: nor this was not the voice of a faythlesse man, but of one
that vehemently desired to see the auctour of so great a benefit. Jesus
therefore with humble words, signifying himself to be the person he spoke
of, says unto him: thou haste already seen him whom thou desyreste to see,
and he it is that talks with thee, on whom it behooves thee to believe.

The man upon these words without any staying at all, confesses with great
promptnes of mind that he does believe: and even with that saying, he fell
down at Jesus knee, and wurshipped him, and so his deed declared what he
thought of Jesus.

said unto them. If ye were blind ye should have no sin. But now ye say
we see, therefore your sin remains. Now than, Jesus (to thentent, that by
example of this manne he might the more provoke other men's minds that were
present) says: I that am the light of the world, therefore came into the
world, that the course of things might be turned vpsyde down: as much to
say, that the symilitude and sleight of untrue holiness and forged knoweledge,
being disclosed, these which heretofore saw not, might se: and that they
which see might be made blind. With this saying, I am come iniudgeme^t etc.
Jesus noted the naughty perverse judgment of the Pharisees, which though they
thought that only they knew what was religion, what was law, and what was
righteousness, yet were they more foul ouerseen, than any of the mean sort of
people, by reason that worldelye covetousness had darkened the judgment of
their mind, when as that sely poor blind fellow, simple and unlearned,
likewise as he had bodily sight freely given him, so did he inwardly see so
much in soul, that in knowlage of truth he excelled even the very pharisees.
Neither did these bytyng words so escape all the Phariseis (which followed
Jesus of no good mind, but rather to seek on every side, occasion to reprove
him) but that the styng of this saying caused some of them to mark it, so that
those were not beguiled therewith. These, being nothing altered from their
malepert presumpcion, to the intent that they might either force the Lord to
testify honorably of them, or to have some matter to accuse him of unto them
that were of the pharisees order, say unto him: are we than blind also? But
Jesus does so answer unto this question, which was very wily, capcious, and
also presumptuouse, that he declares them, which thought themselves men of
great fight, to be more than blind: not in body but in soul, and to be the
more vncurably blind, If ye were blind ye should have no sin.
because they thought themselves quick sighted. Uerely (says Jesus) if ye
were blind, and would knowledge how ignorant in soul ye be, your
simplicity should be pardoned. But now, forasmuch as ye be blind in deed,
and yet ye would be praised among the people for learned men, ye are so very
stark blind that ye cannot be healed. As this blind manne has obtained
sight because he knowledged the deformity of his body, even so you, because ye
be voluntary blind, as men blinded through lusts of your flesh, cannot be
cured, but continue in the sin of infidelity: whereas the unlearned which
first were ignorant of the truth, upon the sight of miracles, and by hearing
me preach (all darkness taken away) enbraceth the light of the truth. He
that presumptuously takes upon him to know the law, and speaks against
him that is the principal point and conclusion of the law, is more than
blind, and altogether out of the way. All men have lived heretofore under
shadows, nor any way lies open to the lightwarde, but by faith of the
gospel. Therefore the common and vulgar people souer receive sight, because
they do not very much think themselves well sighted, and if they be any whit
ouerseen, it is rather through rude ignorance than malice. But they that when
themselves be twice blind, yet they profess themselves teachers of the
people, that is, guiders of the blind: such, I say, be sta^ke blind, and
most daungerously, without recovery. For neither they themselves come to the
light, and yet through false opinion, and pretense of learning and holiness,
they seduce and bring other into error.

The.x. Chapter.

ANd albeit they were such, yet did they disdain and envy, the Lord Jesus,
because he did allure the people unto him, and withdrewe them from the
obedience of the Phariseis and priests, which said persons, because they
could no longer defend their authority by honest means, they do their
ende^oure to mayntaine their tyranny with disceites, frayinges, wyles, traynes,
thretninges and wicked conspiracies, not attendyng the peoples commodity, as
it had been fit they should have done, considering they professed themselfes
teachers, guydes, and shepeherdes of the people, but with the peoples
discommoditie sought their own commodity: Jesus therefore, who had before time
by many and diverse similitudes enuited all men unto him, somewhyle calling
himself heavenly bread, whereof he that did eat should live ternally: Some
time namyng himself lively water, whereof who so did drink, should conceive in
himself a spryng of water that would gushe out and run into everlasting
life: some time the light of the world that lighteneth all men's minds: an
other time the son and ambassador of God the father, on whom he that did
believe should obtain eternal salvation: In this place he does the same thing
by an other parable, entendyng that that thing should more depely settle in all
men's minds, which is the ^hiefe and head point of man's whole salvation,
that is to wit, that no man can be a directour or shepeherde of people,
unless himself be first a sheep of Christ, that true shepeherde of all the
sheep that are to be placed on the right hand in the last day. But surely he
is not Christ's sheep, that is not a membre of Chrste: and he is no membre of
Christ that does prefer this world or his own honor before Christ's
glory. But the Phariseis, because they would be shepeherdes without Christ,
they were therefore robbers and thieves and no shepeherdes though they challenged
as due to themselfes, the name, the hye look, and solemn gravity of a
shepeherde. Jesus therefore noting them, says: one thing I assure you of,
whosoever enters into the shepefold, not by the door, but enters with
force an other way, as either by climyng over the enclosures, or by diggyng
through the walls, the same is no shepeherd, but a these, and a murderer. A
thief to catch somewhat by fraud and stealth, a murderer to kill by
violence. But whosoever enters in by the door, because he deuiseth no guile
against the sheep, he is a shepeherde: and to him having mind to enter in by
the door, shall he open the door, which only has the right to let in.
Though the sheep be a fearde at the unknown voice of the thief and murderer,
yet do they acknowledge and hear this man's voice: because it is the true
shepeherdes voice. For albeit the sheep be a seely simple beast, and depends
of the aid of other, yet sheep do know the voice of the shepeherde, of whom
they perceive relefe: and they quake for fear at the voice of wulfes, by whom
they be put in fear of death. Therefore the shepeherde going into the
shepefolde by the door, makes not the sheep afearde, but is well enough
known, and on his behalf knows his sheep, so that he can also name every
one of them, and they being called do obey his voice. For they be called to
their food and meat, and not to the fle^he shambles to be killed. And they be
called with a frendely and with a known voice: they be not thruste out with
violence: and the shepeherde conducteth them, being ready and toward at his
call, to pastures: and when they be once brought out of the fold (wherein they
were enclosed) and are come abroad into the common fields, lest they should
run astray, the true and known shepeherde goes before his flock: and ye
flock follows him. For he goes not all hushed and dumme before them, but
eftsoon entiseth them to follow him: and calls the sheep back again in
case they be wandered and strayed aside. And they know their shepeherdes
voice, and thereat come into order. But they do not follow the shepeherde of an
other flock: but loeth him, and fly from him as unknown, because they know
no another shepeherdes voice but their own.

With this parable our Lord Jesus did sore reprove the Phariseis, the Scribes,
the priests, and headmen of the people, which had indignacion and disdained
that there should be so many which had leauer cleave unto Jesus than to them
that took themselfes to be the guides of the people. Moreover they that were
very swyne and goats, gave ear to those men's voices. But they that were
truly sheep, without fraud, simple, and that does no harm, did knowlage the
voice of the Lord Jesus: who was the true shepeherde to whom the father being
porter, opened the door, that he might led his obedient sheep into the
pastures of everlasting life. But for so much as the Phariseis did not
understand what this parable meant, Jesus did vouchesafe to make plain the
things which he had spoken darkely, for two skilles, those, to make them more
atte^tiue, the other, that the matter which he uttered by a parable, might
take root deper in their hertes that heard him, he says unto them: I do
affirm unto you a most true thing. I am the very door whereof I have spoken,
by which door the sheep yt will be saved must go in and out. By this door it
behooves him to go in, that will enter to the office of a shepeherd, and
exercise that funccion, for it is not enough, at all adventures (not regarding
what way) to have entered forceably within the limits, enclosure, and
shepefolde of ye church. It is not sufficient to have attained the name and
dignity of a shepeherde, not forcing how. How many soever has been such,
that by evil means have rashely run into the shepefolde of Gods people, not
of any mind to feed, but to spoil, because they have not entered by me that
am ye door, they be no shepeherdes, but thieves and murderers, forasmuch as
they be gredy of lucre, and in cruelty rigorous and very tirauntes. But yet
those swine and goats that love this world, have given ear to all these
manier of voices. But sheep limited and predestinate to the pastures of
eternal life* and that are desirous of food of the gospel, have not heard
the voice of these, nor known in them any gospellers voice, because they were
not true shepeherdes. For their voice sounds nothing shepeheardlyke. But more
like the voice of a robber, and of a ravenous woulfe. I am (I tell you) the
door. There is no healthful entryng into the church and kingdom of heaven but
by me, whether thou will be shepeherde or sheep. If any enter in by me, he
shall attain eternal health: and shall be without all danger of thieves and
murderers, but through this shepehearde shall go into the shepefolde safe, and
take the fruicion of the blessed quietness of contemplacion, and shall again go
out into the pastures, to practice and put in ure the office of charity. And
there shall no where lack pastures, but in all places shall be matter to do
good upon, to the intent he may both profit other, and he himself through
good deeds repair home again to the shepefolde more fatter and better likyng.
Thus now ye have one token, whereby ye may discern a sheep from a goat, a
true shepeherde from a false. He that believes not on me, and yet makes
himself a shepeheard of the people, of him ought men to beware. And his voice
shall tha^ disclose what manier one he is, if his words have no taste of
Gods glory, if they sauoure not of the peoples health: but of his own
praise, of gain, of worldly subtlety, and of tyranny: let the sheep take heed
to themselves and beware of him: for he is a thief and a murderer, he is no
shepehearde. And he is the more dangerous, because he fameth himself to be a
shepeheard. And in case the voice be not a sufficient proof, take heed to their
deeds.

The thief cummeth for none other purpose but to steal, and to get himself
vile and filthy gain of the harms of an other man's flock. The murderer
cu^meth not but to worry and destroy, and to practice tira^ny upon the flock,
unto the which to have dooen good, had been his part and duty. Three ways
therefore it shall be lefull to decerne the true shepeheard from the thief or
prayecatcher: If he enter not in by the door, that is to say, if he do not
acknowlage me by whom only there is hope of eternal health: If he speak
not those things which agrees with the doctrine of God: thyrdely if his
intent be directed any other way than to those things that appartayne to
Gods glory, and salvation of the people. If none of these faults can be
found in me, but if rather the father of heaven have opened the door, if I
speak those things which accords with the meaning of the law, and which
are agreeable to the will of the father of heaven, if I do no where hunte for
lucre or mine own praise, I am the good shepehearde.
but obeying my fathers pleasure, thirst after nothing else but al folks
health, than understand ye that I am the true shepehearde, and acknowlage ye
my founder, my voice, my desire and study.

They that auaunt themselves to be shepeheardes, go about this, verily even
to get themselves commodity of your discommodities, who than fare best when
the flock fares wurst. I that have entered in by the door, came for none
other thing, but that the diseased sheep should be healed, the dead should
live, and the quick should be fatted with all kind of virtues. He is taken
for a good shepehearde which lives in deed of the revenues and yearly
profits that come of his sheep, which purloyneth nothing, or nothing
deuoureth. But an evangelical shepehearde far passes this upright dealyng.
For he does not only not spoil as the thief does, not only not tear in
pieces as the pray catcher does, but also bestows his own life for to
defend his sheep, so far of it is that he would for any gain sake, hurt the
flock that he is put in trust withal, or lose that which he has taken in hand
to keep. Therefore the other sort, that braggue upon their being shepherdes, are
woulfes and no shepeherdes. But if ye demand an exaumple, and a proof of a
good shepherde, it is I that am a good shepherde, which do not only my self
not seek my commodity of the flocks harm* but I also do freely give of mine
own goods, yea and my life too, to resist them that come against the
flock, to endammage or grieve it. I do that for my sheep, that one friend
will not do for another. He cannot be a shepherde unless he be pure from all
singular profit and private commodity, except also he set even his own life
at naught, when at any time the flock stands in ieopardy. For there be many
things that make incursion against the health of the flock. Therefore he that
is a true shephearde, and in his heart cares for the flock for none other
skill, but because he lou^th the flock, ready to do his commandment that
gave him that flock to be kept safe, and not to be nigh shorn, spoiled,
slain, or worried, he defends the health of his sheep, even with the loss of
his own life.

But contrary, he that is an hierelinge, and has taken the oversight of the
flock for his own advantage, yet although he do rightlye govern, and rule
the flock whiles al things be caulme and quiet, yet if there hang any
ieopardye of life thereupon, that is to were, if he see the woulfe prease upon
him furyously, he betrayeth the sheep, and leaves the flock to the woulfe to
be scattered abroad, and so piece meal to be worried, and saves his own life
by runnyng away. And what is the cause? Nothing else but because he is an hired
servant, and no shepeherd. True charity has no respect to the reward.
Whereas consideracion of the reward has place, there is either no charity* or
imperfect charity. And if there be any duty done, it is not done with that
good will that a true shepehearde would do it with all. But where the thing
most requires the very natural shepehearde, there tha^ is ye flock
deceitfully betrayed, whiles the hired shepeherde runs away. And why is
that? Because, when that he has considered the matter after worldly judgment,
he counts it better that an other man's flock do perish, than himself to
come in peril of life. And yet is this manner of men some deal better than
they, which play the woulfes themselves against the flock, under the false
title of shepeheardes. For there be they, which in time of prosperity does
right faithfully take heed to their flock, but yet when there is a great
danger, they leave traitorously the flock to the woulf to be disperpled
abroad and torn in pieces: for he fantasieth thus: In case they go to wrack,
what than? I have no loss thereby. My wage is safe, and though I lose some
deal thereof, I had rather lose it, than to cope and fight with the woulfe, for
another man's cattle. There shall another flock be found out, which I shall
be hired to have the oversight of: though the master of this flock loose it.

Neither does the death of the flock grieve the hired man's mind. So it
happens that both the owner has loss of that thing which he entierely
loves, and the flock cummeth to destruction, which might have been saved.
It is therefore no meruayl, though euangelike sheep knew not the voice of such
like shepeherdes. The sheep be not in fault, but the lewd shepherdes are to
blame. Nor it is not to be disdained at, if they whom my father so draws, do
follow me, forsakyng the hired shepherdes that are but very thieves and
murderers. For they feel and perceive that I am all manner of ways a good
shepeherde, even to spend my life therefore. I know my sheep committed to me of
my father, al whose goods are mine: and on the other side, the sheep that are
drawn by the inspiracion of the father, acknowlageth their shepeherd, loves
him, and follows him, knowing right well that there is no hope of salvation
but by me.

The father knows me as his own natural son, obeying his will in all
things: and again I know the father, who desires, that all men should be
saved. At his commandment I bestow my life for the safety of my sheep
which he has given me to have them saved: nor any thing will I so do, that
this world (while I am the shepherd) shall have power to harm them, nor yet
the prince of this world the devil: but to keep my sheep whole and sound, I will
give my self to death, by that meannes to abate the woulfes violence: and to
deliver my obedient sheep out of his chawes.

Nor it does not fully content the fathers will and my charity, if I should
save these sheep alone, which being of the people of Israel, he has given to
me to be saved first, but my cure reaches further than so. There be also in
other nations sheep scattered and in daungier of snares, of woulfes, thieves,
and murderers: neither will I rest until I bring these also into the common
shepefold. And although they hear not the voice of Moses, or of the prophets,
yet shall they know and give ear to my voice, I mean such as be ordained to
salvation. For the country does not exclude from salvation. Whosoever
hears the voice of the son of God, (who is the very true shepeherd) shall be
saved. Hitherto the flock of God has been scattered through the multitude of
false shepeherdes. All does promise salvation, and every one has his voice,
and one calls this way and an other the other way. In the mean while, the
flock being destitute, is scattered here and there, and diverse ways
perishes. But so soon as they shall hear me, all they will know the voice
of the true shepeherde, and they shall come together out of all parts of the
world. And so shall be made one fold of all, and no more shepeherdes but one.
He that is without this fold cannot be saved. He that dooethe not acknowlage
this shepeherd, shall go to perdicion. But lest that should happen through my
fault, I so thoroughly play the good shepeherde, that I lose my life clearly.
There is no decay in my father, I give my life for the sheep. etc.
though all thing that be create do peryshe, for he has need of nothing, but
of mere charity toward mankind, he sent his son to save all men if it
could be. And because I am of the same mind that my father is of, therefore he
does derely love me, as his own son, and no hired manne, because of mine
own good will I bestow my life for the health of my fathers flock, it is so
much more unlike that I would, to hurt the flock withal, seek out mine own
commodity. Amongst men it is a great love, if one when there is ieopardie
toward and daungier imminente, does not privily steal away. I do more,
who with a free good will, give my self to death. There be that lies in
wait to have my life, well, their malice could not prevail against me,
except I were determined of mine own free will, to dye for the salvation of
mine. These folk of truth are in mind to murder, yet could they not kyl me
unless I would my self. Therefore they shall not take from me my life, but I
will willyngly yield it up to redeem my sheep with my death to everlasting life.
Do not believe that I shall willingly give my self unto death, except I take
again that willingly left life, even of mine own power, when I will. Herein
consists the praise of a true shepeherde, that of his free will he offers
himself to death for the flocks health, when it lies in his own power to
eschew death if he list. No man's power could take my life from me against my
will, I put my life from me yt I might take it again.
but I give it willingly for the flocks salvation. Other dye when as they
would not, and being dead they revive not. And though a man may wickedly kill
himself, yet cannot he revive his body again, with the life that is once
gone. I have power to do both, to send forth this life out of the body, and
to call again the same into the very self said body. In case it seem a thing
incredible unto you, that any manne should willingly redeem an other man's
life with his own death, no more to say, but it is so thought to my father
that sent me into this world, by this way to weorke the feate of man's
salvation. I willingly and gladly do obey his commandment, whose will and
mine are all one, and who has given me power to perform my will.

When Jesus had told a long tale of these things that were strange, unheard
of and far above the common capacity of most men, there fell a new iar in
opinions among the people: for some said that which they had already many
times said, whenever he disclosed their secret conspiracies, or if he spoke
or did any thing above the power of man: he has the devil (say they) and
is mad. For the words which he speaks, lack common sense. What pleasure
is it to hear this fellow? Again some folk else said: these be no such man's
words, as is in the devils danger. For his words, smells of the power of
God, specially for as much as his deeds be agreeable to his words. As his
words be, such be his deeds. He speaks things far passing man's wit, but
the same does things, which far excede man's power. Can a mad man, and he that
is possessed with a devil open blind men's iyes? It is ye property of devils
to put out ones iyes that sees, but to give fight to him that is borne blind,
cummeth of the power of God. Forasmuch than as it is evident that that thing
is done by him, his talk cannot proceed of a noisome devil, whose deeds
appears plain to come from a beneficial God. The Lord Jesus makes no
answer to this altercacyon, teaching us by the way, that the wieked are not
always to be striuen with in words: and that by deeds it is rather to be
declared what we can do, than by words: and sumtimes place is to be given
to the fury of the eiuil sort, nor the moderate temperaunce of the gospel,
is at any time to be forgotten. After all this the feastful day ministered
new matter to set in hand and dispute with him again. That solemn feast
was than, which they call the dedicacyon of the temple, for because the temple
was reedefyed and repaired after the exile that was made at Jerusalem by the
Persians. Neither was Jesus absent at this feasteful day, a new maker of the
law, and of a new temple, that is to say, the church, chief deuyser and
master of the works. And it was winter: A full very mere time for their
minds, which through love of the cold law, did not burn in the love of
the gospel. Therefore Jesus was not now in the inner part of the temple, but
walked in the porche which joins to the temple, that is called Salomons
temple, to the intent that the very place should declare that peacemaker to be
present, which should reconcyle all things in heaven and earth. There
walked truly the aucthor of the law of the ghospel, Moses law being now at
a point to cease. The Jews therefore, lest he should escape their hands,
came round about him, while he was walkyng there, sore moved with many of his
sayings and doings: neither did they well agree among themselves, If thou
be Christ, tell us plainly.
some maliciously fynding fault with all thing, some gathering of his deeds and
words, a certain thing to be honored in him above man's power. And they set
upon him with these words: How long will thou keep us in a doubtful mind,
and therewith set the people on a rore? If thou be that very Messiah, whom
we look for, tell it us openly without all color.

But although Jesus was not ignorant that they did demand of a perverse
mind this thing, which they had both oftentimes heard, and might also have
perceived the same by his doings, yet he makes them a gentle answer, more
desirous to enstruct them, then to anger them. What needs it me (says he) so
often to speak of my self, and tell who I am? namely forasmuch as if I do
openly testify the truth, ye call the record thereof arrogancy. I have
already told you (if ye would believe me) who I am: Yea though ye do not
credit my words, yet ye cannot be ignorant of the thing which ye desire
know of me.

There is no surer proof than deeds: Ye see my doings, which your selves do
witness I do at my fathers will and not the deuilles, as some do misreporte.
If my acts be worthy to be imputed to God, believe that I am sent of God,
But ye do neither believe my deeds nor my words: whereof I am not the cause,
but your own corrupt and suspiciouse mind. They that mean well and
playnelye and be not polluted with the naughtynesse of this world, beeleue my
words, and like good sheep know the voice of a good shepeherd: and semblably
I knowlage them for my sheep, though after the world they be poor sely
things. But ye therefore do not knowledge my voice, because ye are not of the
number of my sheep, whose simplicity is lightely taught, when as your minds
be swollen with ambicion, leuened with malice, with envy corrupted, infected
with covetousness, and with sundry affeccions of this world defiled, from
which vices, if ye would purge your mind, verily even you also should hear
my voice: neither should you so do without benefit. For first of al, ye should
thereby avoid death, which hangs over all rebels against the son of God:
moreover ye shall obtain thereby everlasting life. For of truth, those my
sheep (how simple and unlearned soever they be after the judgment of the
world) as long as they do knowleage me the shepeherde, and all the while they
follow me as gyde, do through my liberality, get everlasting life: when as
other that are taken in the world for men of great felicity, go to
everlasting death. They be simple sheep, harmless, weak, lacking all
worldely succor. The world rises against these with all engiens and force.
But the aduersarye shall not have so great power, that he shall be hable to
take them out of my hands. The world has authority of phariseis, dignity of
priests, it has armed kings, hye magistrates, judges, places of judgment,
prisones, cheines, rods, axes, broddes to prick with, exile, deaths, and
whatsoever is wont to bring fear, yea even to steadfast minds. On the other
side, it has riches, pleasures, dignities, honors, and what soever is wont to
corrupt most vncorrupt minds. The world uses all these engines to pluck my
sheep out of my hands, but I being their protector and governor, no man
shall be hable to take them away from me. What thing soever the world shall
go about, the same shall be commodiouse to the sheep, and turn to my fathers
glory. We will not fight again with weapons, or with poison, we will not
counter with them and give rebuke for rebuke, but without such defense, we
shall yet by a new way, have the victory.

My father. etc. is greater than al. etc.
That defense alone, which my father has given me to defend my sheep withal,
is greater and of more force than all the wepons, wherewithal the world shall
rise against me and mine. Neither will my father forsake me, nor I my sheep.
The same thing that lies in me to do, lies also in my father to do. And
because there is no power of the world that can force any thing out of his
hands, which can do all things with a nodde, neither can any thing pull
that out of my hands, which he has taken me to keep: As there is an exact
companionship of power between my father and me: so there is a full consent of
will. We be thoroughly one, all one in power, all one in will and nill. The
Jews being sore moved with these sayings, not content with so often namyng
his father, by whose defense he promised so great things, took up stones
again to stone Jesus. But yet no man set upon him, because his time was not as
yet come, in which he had determined to dye for the salvation of mankind, but
he assayeth to assuage and mitigate their fury with gentle words. The people
are accustomed to take up stones in their hands (says he) and so openly to
punish evil doers, and common malefactors. I have done naught else but
bestowed benefits on you of my fathers liberality: I have better enstruct
them that erred; I have comforted them that were in affliccion, I have fed ye
hungry, I have restored the one handed to both, I have made clean the
leprouse, I have healed the sick, I have driven away devils from men, I have
set them on fo^e that were diseased of the palsy, and such as had their ^nowes
shrounken, I have put away fevers, and all diseases and maladies, I have
called the dead to life again, and the whole power and authority which my
father has given me, has been bestowed to succor you, and it has been freely
employed to your commodity. In all these things now which is yt one thing that
ye think worthy stoning? If he that is good and liberal be stoned, what is to
be done to naughty folk, and to them that be harmful? The Jews being brought
in conclusion to this point, that either they must bring furthe some fault
against him, or clies aknowlage their own folly, lest they should have no
pretext to hyde their fury withal: we (say they) are not wont to stone any
man for his good weorkes sake, but we count thee worthy to be stoned for an
horrible crime, of all other most great, even blasphemye: And in this thing
we follow the authority of the law, which commands such should be
overthrown with stones. Who can suffer any longer, that thou being a man,
make thy self God, having eftsoon god thy father in thy mouth, as though
we al were not the children of god, and as though thou were by some new and
peculiar way, Gods son, that thou and thy father may be parteners in all
things? Is not this to take a certain godhead upon thee? But forasmuch as
there is but one God, what manne so ever (therefore) takes upon him to be
fellow with god in power, is injurious to Gods majesty, and a rebel. The Lord
Jesus does with such moderacion make answer unto this fault which was
laid to his charge, that he clearelye avoided from him the sin of
blasphemy, and that also he did not, with any terrible words more engreue
their frowardnes, and yet he did with great sobriety defend that his due,
which he ought not to deny, because he would not have it unknown to us: You
(says he) lay blasphemy to my charge because I name God to be my father. Is
there not a greatter thing than that written in your law, even in the Psalms?
I have said ye are al gods, and sons of him that is hie. If god himself give
praise of the dignity of his name to them, unto whom the word of God was
spoken not only calling them the children of God, but gods too, and yet was
not the majesty of one god harmed, nor that thing can be untrue which is
declared in holy scripture, how can ye stretche to me the fault of
blasphemy, that do say, I am the son of God, whom the father has only
sanctified and sent unto the world, that by the son al should obtain
holiness? If co^municacion had between God and man, make of men gods, and the
children of God, is it not a thing to be borne with, if I say that I am gods
son, which am the word of God it self, and who was with god before I came
into the world, and am he that has coumpany with him in all things? It is no
presumpteouse thing that I take upon me in my words, a thing verily that
beseems many other, by the authority of scripture. But it were more
convenient to judge by the self deeds, what name I ought to have.

If my deeds do not prove me to be above a man, if they have not the proof
of godly power, believe not that I am the son of God, and that God and I agree
thoroughly in all points. But if ye see God the father show forth his power in
me, though algates ye will give no faith to my words, yet at least believe the
deeds that ye see with your iyes, and take me for arrogant if I do not
perform more in deeds, than I take upon me in words. If ye would consider
those things with pure simple minds, it should come to pass that ye would
give faith to my words too, and doubt no more, but that the father is in me,
and I in the father, that both we, the one and the other, are sociate and
adherent together naturally and unseparably, whiles he woorketh by me,
whatsoever he will, and I do no where swerve or alter from his exaumple and
commandment: In so much that he which believes on him, believes on me, and
whosoever speaks against him, speaks against me.

When the Jews had heard these sayings, being therewith more an angered,
wherewith in deed they ought to have been reformed, they go about to lay
hands on him, and so to accomplish that thing which they had already often
attempted in vain. But Jesus escaped out of their hands, declaryng thereby,
that he was well willing to suffer, when time should come. Therefore when Jesus
had taught there sufficientlye, he gives place for a time to their incurable
fury, and went over again beyond Iordane, to the very place where John begun
first to baptize, (for as we have said, he afterward changed his place, and
baptized at the water of Sichem.) Here now Jesus abode in the deserte, as one
that had lothed or extremely hated the sinful wickedness of the cities. And
many came also thither unto him, out of places yt joined nigh thereunto, whose
minds the fame that was bruted of Jesus, the sermons and miracles yt were
heard and seen, did inflame. And of truth, the very place brought them
furthwith in mind to compare Jesus, who had already showed some trial and
proof of himself, with John, whom they had known before. And wha^ they
remembered that John had been in high authority, and yet had dooen nothing else
but preached the baptism of penance, and without dooyng any miracles had
gotten himself so great estimacyon among the multitude, that he was thought
to be Christ: And on the other side, when Jesus had by showing forth so many
miracles, declared a power greater then man's strength, yt he had so often put
the Scribes and Phariseis to silence, with his prudent and piththie aunswers:
Finally, that John himself had so often testified so highly of Jesus,
confessing openly that himself was not worthy to leuse the latchet of his
shoe: The Jews (I say) considering all these things, had this saying among
themselves. John (say they) when as he wroughte no miracle, was in credit with
the Jews. Much more therefore ought faith to be given to this man, that with so
wonderful seldom seen miracles, gathers or wins faith to his words. And
albeit John's record of this man were heretofore little believed, yet now the
matter self declares that his record was true, for so much as this said
Jesus has accomplished mo things than John promised of the man's behalf. And
so now therefore, partly for John's relacions sake, (whose report had no
slender authority among the Jews,) partly through his own words that were
full of godly wisdom, and partly for his deeds sake which did bear witness of
his divine power, many believed that Jesus was very Messiah, whiles yet the
Phariseis, the Scribes, and the Priests, did still continue and persiste in
their froward malice.

The xi. Chapter.

ANd furthwith occasion is offered, whereby Christ's glory and his fathers
should highly be renowned, and withal the malice of the phariseis should be
provoked to murder. For while he made his abode at Iordane, it chanced that a
certain man called Lazarus, lay sick in the town Bethania. This was both the
sick ma^s and the twoe sisters Marie and Marthaes country. Furthermore, Mary
was she, that (to ye notable proof of love toward Jesus) with a precious
oyntmente anointed his head sitting at the feast, and with her hear wiped his
fete, which she had washed with tears. Whereof came a great amity between the
Lord Jesus and this family. Therefore when Lazarus was through grievous
sickness in peril, his sisters (trusting upon the acquayntaunce that they
had with Jesus) sends to show him of his friends disease, doubtyng not but
that he would of his merueylouse ge^tlenes toward all folk, help his friend
being in danger. Behold (say they) he whom thou love is sick. For they
thought it enough to signify the thing to him that loved the manne, and
therefore they made not further intercession. To whom Jesus made answer: this
sickness is not unto death. God has suffered it to fall upon him, that by that
occasion, God and his son should be glorified, with putting away the
sickness by their godly power.

not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day he stumbleth not:
because he sees the light of this world: but if a man walk in the night, he
stumbleth because there is no light in him. Jesus verily loved Martha and Mary,
and their brother Lazarus too, and yet suffered he him to fall into sickness,
and also to dye: lest we should think it an unseemly thing, if at any time
good folk and right holy men be punyshed with miseries of this world: god,
as it were dissembling, either because so it is expedient for them y^ suffer,
or else because it so helps to set forth the glory of God, not that God does
through man's harm procure his own glory, but that for man's sake, he is wont
to turn the eiuels, which chaunseth us after the law of man's state and
condition, or by casualtie, to our salvation, or to his own glory. He knew
right well his friends sickness: yea, before it was told him. But yet was it
fit, that his disciples minds should be prepared and made ready for the great
miracle that was to come. Therefore after report was made to Jesus of his
friends disease, he did not furthwith go thence, but tarried still two days in
that same place, verayly not neglecting the danger of his friends, but looking
for a more large matter to work a miracle of, wherwithal he himself, who
should sone after dye, might lift up the minds of his disciples, weak and
feeble as yet, to the hope of the resurreccion.

But his disciples keeping silence for fear, because he of late escaping the
hands of the Jews, was thought to be more safe in the deserte, Jesus said
unto them: Let us go into Iewrie again. When the disciples heard Iewry named,
remembryng how vengeable and cruel the Phariseis hatred was cowardes him, and
how often they had taken up stones to cast at him, how often they endeavored
themselves to apprehende him: the disciples (I say) stood in dread not only
of their masters harm, but also of their own. For as yet they had not
received the holy ghost, and bare a certain worldely affeccion toward Jesus,
themselves likewise through feebleness lothyng death. Therefore dissuading him
from going again into Iewrie, they say: Sir have you forgotten how that there
a while ago the Jews would have stoned you, unless ye had secretly
withdrawn your self? And will you go thither again puttyng your self in
open danger? But Jesus did coumforte their fearfulness by a parable,
signifying that nothing is to be dredde of them that clean to Christ: who is
the light of the world. For the night has vayn fears. The day knows no
such terrors. Has not the day (says Christ) twelve hours? The night
shall not come before his time. In the mean time, whosoever walks in the
day, stumbleth not: for why, the sun makes him to see and to eschew
stumblyng. But the sun being taken away, whosoever walks in the night,
stumbleth, because he lacks light. I am the light of the world, it is right
mete that you be guided by me, and follow my conductyng, and not to go before
the light. Be not afraid before the time. So long as I give light unto you,
there is no ieopardie. The night shall come, when you being disseuered from
me, shall be troubled.

Howbeit Jesus spoke of his death, When Jesus had with this saying mitigate the
Apostles fear, he shows the cause of his going forth on his journey, saying:
Our friend Lazarus sleapeth, I therefore go hence to wake him. When as the
disciples that were troubled with fear supposed that Jesus did not speak of
very death, but of the common sleep, they answer: Sir if he sleep, there is
no cause why you should go thither, for sleep in sick folk is wont to be a
token of recovery of health. The disciples were loath to go into Iewry again, and
therefore to the uttermost of their power, they do avoid the causes of going
thither. But Jesus did by little and little prepare the minds of his, earnestly
to consider and behold the miracle to come. For he had therefore leauer say
first he was aslepe then dead, to the entente he might after the usage of holy
scripture, show the hope of the resurreccion. For they be rather aslepe then
dead, which rest to live again. Neither is it so easy for any of us to awake
him that sleapeth, as it is for the Lord to call the dead to life. Therefore
the discyples not understanding the thing that he spoke of sleep, and waking
out of sleep, to let them know that no hid thing was unknown to him,
Lazarus is dead and I am glad for your sakes. etc.
he says unto them more plainly: Lazarus is dead, nor he added not the thing
that was than more stout to be spoken, as concerning the raising him up again.
For he would rather that to be signified than expressed, and his mind was
rather to do the thing, than promise it, every where making ready for us an
exaumple of modestye and temperaunce. And because he answered them that told
him his friend was sick, that that sickness was not deadly, but chanced to
the entente that Gods glory and his sons also should be set furthe by
it: a like thing shows he to his disciples, saying: I am glad that I was not
there while my friend was sick and dyed, and for your cause I rejoice, that
your trust which I perceive to be weak as yet, may be strengthed and
confirmed with a more evident miracle. For if the sick man had mended and
recovered health (I being present) it might have been thought a casualtie: in
case I had at his sisters requests raised him that had been newly dead, the
Phariseis which find fault with all things, might have laid for them that
it had been a lacking of senses, or but a swouning, and no death, for that
sumtimes happens in some diseases, that the bodies lying a long time in
swoune, come to life again. Now for as much as it is a very death in deed,
there shall be a more plenteouse matter of belief. Therefore let us go to him.
The going thither pleased not the disciples for fear of the Jews, which fear
slack sore in their minds, and yet could they not improve the godly and
weighty cause of that journey.

And albeit Jesus was not ignorant what thing troubled the minds of his
disciples, and though also he swaged their dread by reason that he said he
should go to Bethania and not to Jerusalem, yet nevertheless the nyenesse
of the place that they feared, made also their timorouse minds afraid.

The disciples being careful and pensyfe, (and yet durst they not refuse to
do their masters commandment,) Thomas whom the Greeks call Didimus, and in
Latin is named geminus (a twinne) being more timorouse than the rest, says
unto his fellows: let us also go, (if it be certainly thus) to dye with him,
for as much as his determinate mind is, to bring both himself and his, into
a manyfeste peril of life, whereas he may so devise that both shall be in
safety. Jesus than went forth with his disciples to Bethania, and found that
Lazarus had lain in his grave four days already. Uerily Bethania was about
fiftene furlonges of from Jerusalem, and thereof came the discyples fear, and
thereupon also arose occasion that caused the miracle have more witnesses and
lokers upon. For the nighnes of the place caused many to come thither out of
Jerusalem, even of favor they bear to Marie and Martha, and of neyghbourlye
duty to coumforte them in the death of their brother. Which kind of office
and duty was wont to be done to rich folk, even for honor sake.

Martha that diligently bestirred her, went about all things with diligence:
when one had told her that Jesus was come nyghe at hand, she with speed went
out to mete him. Marie kept still the house: Martha therefore when she was
within the sight of Jesus (upon right good hope that she had conceived of her
brother to be called to life again) with a doleful voice, she said unto him:
lord if thou had been here, my brother had not been dead, for thou couldeste
soon have healed him with a word. Although in deed the thing is not yet even
at this present utterly without hope. For I know that what thing soever thou
ask of God, he will deny the nothing, although thou would ask life in
him that is dead and buried. These sayings were spoken of Martha with a mind
that neither did utterly despair, nor yet fully believe. Therefore to confirm
her belief, Jesus said unto her: be of good coumforte, thy brother shall rise
again. Neither did this promise satisfye Marthaes mind, who (because she had
but a siely piteouse hope of her brothers rising again) could not but fear
the matter. She was afraid verilye, that like as he answered the messengers,
saying that the sickness was not deathlyke, and with that doubtefull answer
beguiled them, so was there now likewise some mystery in his words that
should disapoynt and deceive her hope: I know (says she) that my brother
shall rise again: but that shall be in the last day when we shall all rise
again, for some Jews, namely they that were of the Phariseis sect, believed
that there should be a general resurreccyon.

Jesus therefore to further the woman's affiaunce and opinion of him, by little
and little to greater things, and that he might declare himself to be very he,
that not only could obteyn by prayer, of God, life to the dead (a thing that
is read often to be dooen of other holy men) but to be the very fountain
self and author of life, both already given and to be given to all things,
nor that any death is to be feared of them, that puts their confidence and
hope in him, forasmuch as though death chance, it can nothing hurt him
that cleaves fast to the fountain of all life: Jesus (I say) upon these
consideracions, answers Martha on this wise: Thou beleueste Martha that with
my prayers I may obtain of my father, life for thy brother which is dead:
thou beleueste that thy brother shall be restored to life again (as other
shall be) in the last day. Yea but thou must believe this also: that they which
shall rise in the last day, shall have life by me, nor that any man has life
at all, but by my gift, neither is any restored to life again but by me, not
only touching death of body, which is not much to be feared, but as
concerning the death of the soul also, which is most of all to be feared. And
the soul that lives, lives by me. And the reviving soul, reuiueth by me,
for I am the very fountain of resurreccion and life. He that cleueth to me by
faith, although he be dead in body, yet shall he live. And take not this
saying to be only spoken of thy brother, but generally, what man or woman
soever has faithful affiau^ce in me, he shall not dye everlastingly, although
his body lyuelesse lie at rest for a time. Martha, beleuest thou the thing that
I say? Martha being at this time altogether myndeful to have her brother
revived again, gives no very apre answer to Jesus saying, but yet she did
confess generally how hiely she judged of him, saying: Lord I do believe. I
believe that thou art Messiah, the son of the living God, who being promised
of the Prophets, and many hundredth years looked for, art come into the world.

Martha upon these words being commanded to return home again, and to call
her sister Marie, (her lamentable mourning already aswaged) does now leave
Jesus, and goes al cheerful and full of good hope home to her sister: and
calls her secretly out of the throng of such as were set round about her,
and prieuely tells her in her ear the joyful thing, saying: The master is
come and calls for the. As Soon as Marie knew that Jesus was come, and saw her
sister cheerful and of good coumfort, she her self also conceived some good
hope, although Jesus seemed to have come already to late, on whom therefore they
did not often call by messenger, because they thought it inoughe if he once
knew his friends peril, committyng all other things to his arbinement. And
so Marie, supposing that his cu^ming was not for naught, without delay, rose
up to go mete him before he should enter into the house. And so it was
expedient for the better bestowing of that miracle yt was to be showed. for
fit it was that many Phariseis should be present, which although they came
of very duty for private frendeship sake to se Marie, yet did they hate
Jesus. These surely would not have followed Marie, in case they had known how
that she went to mete Jesus. But therefore the Jews that were with Marie in
the house to coumfort her, when they saw that with so great have she arose up
and went forth of the house, they followed her: suspectyng that upon a soden
pangue and brunte of heaviness, she would have gooen to the grave, and there
to weep her belly full, to saciate her sorrowful heart with tears.

So than Marie went forth and found Jesus as yet vnentred within the walls of
the town: but abode in that place where as Martha had late before met him. For
he tarried there for Marie, whom he commanded to be called to him, chosyng a
place fit to weorke the miracle in: because the grave was not far from that
place, as the manner was than to make the dead men's sepulchers nigh the hye
ways. When Marie was come thither, as soon as ever she saw Jesus (as in deed
she was very woeful) she fell down at his feet and spoke weping, the same
thing that her sister had said: Lord (says she) if thou had been here in
due time, my brother had not been dead, and we had been without this miserable
weping and waylyng. But Jesus, seeing Marie altogether in heuinesse, and the
Jews likewise that followed her, weeping withal, he did not reason and stand
in disputacion with her, as he did with her sister Martha, with whom he talked
aparte (the people being removed aside) neither does he promise any thing,
when as now was place and time to perform in deed, that which he had
promised Martha: but Jesus (I say) first of al groned in the spirit, and was
troubled in himself, even to show the truth of his manhood, ready anon after
to bring forth a sign of his divine power and Godhead. They were no feigned
affeccions, that he was of so loathsome a mind, and in himself so troubled,
but there was good skill why he took unto him those mocyons of mind, which
came not of the infirmity of nature, but by the consent of reason: neither
was it al one cause why other wept and why Jesus was troubled. They bewailed
the death of the body of a certain worldely and natural affection, Jesus
rather mislyked and lothed men's sins, whereby so many souls should
peryshe: he was dysquyeted through the invincible dyffydence of the Jews, who
wept for their friends bodily death, when as them selves (as touching the
soul) were subject to eternal death, and yet did they not weep for
themselves. Jesus desired that all men should revive from this death, and had
indignacion that his doctrine, miracles and death, should be lost in many
one. Therefore, after that by horriblenes of spirit and by trouble of mind,
in countenance, iyes, and in the whole habit of his body, he had genen a
manifest proof of his manhood (teaching also by the way that it behooves not
to yield and be subdued to such affeccions, or to be called away from things
of virtue) the turmoyle of his mind being refrayned and stayed, Jesus said:
where have ye laid him? not that he was ignorant thereof, but to remove all
suspicion of disceyt from the miracle. His kinsfolks answers: Lord, come
and see.

That answer proved that the grave was not far of. And now as if at the
sight of the grave his sorrow had been renewed, Jesus wept
Jesus wept. Groaning and trouble went before, a token of sorrow that with force
entered into his mind. Tears are as it were the blood of a mind already
wounded and overcome. But these tears came not from a mind that was overcome,
for they were not bestowed upon Lazarus that was dead, but they were for us,
that we should believe him to be very man, and also learn how death of the
soul is to be pitied and lamented, which yet men do not in such sort
abhorte and bewail. But the Jews supposing that Jesus was in such mood for
naught else, but for the death of his friend, with whom he was acquaynted,
behold (say they) how enterely he loved Lazarus, for whom being dead he wepeth
in such sort, and yet were they nothing of kin. And some there were that
would have laid to his charge and rebuke, his tears, wherewith he testified no
mean or common love toward Lazarus, sayng: Did not this fellow of late give
sight to the blind beggar with who^ he had no acquaintance? Why than made he
not that his great friend should not die? In case he had no will to do it, why
does he now signifye with tears, love that cummeth out of season? If he
could not do the thing that is more easy to be doe^, how did that feat which
is of more difficulty to be dooen? The physician many times saves the sick
man's life. There was never man before gave sight to him yt was borne blind.

But Jesus now being nigh to the grave, to declare plainly how horrible is the
state of a man that has already lain long in sin, and with how great
repentance, how many tears are nedeful, that through Gods mercy he may
penitentely return to the life of innocence, did groan again, and fared
evil with himself, exemplyfying in himself verily the thing which ought to
be exhibit in us if we will eftsoon repent us of the euilles and return
from the same, wherein we have long time nusseled our selves. Now than they
were come to the grave. It was verily a cave, whose mouth was closed with a
stone laid upon it. And that made much to the belief of the miracle, and to
exclude the suspicyon of inchauntment and delusion, and because the belief
thereof should be more certain and sure if the thing were dooen by the hands
of his friends, and not with Jesus own hands or his disciples (for those
friends suspect no fraud or illusion,) Jesus than turned him to the^ and
said, take away the stone. The plain meaning of Martha, sister to the dead
man, did also set forth and made a more certentie of the miracle. For she now
forgetting what Jesus had promised her, did through the weeping and heuinesse
that she saw Jesus in, come again into her old mind and affection, and
conceived almost a certain diffidence. Uerely she feared lest (the stone being
taken away) the styncke of the dead body should offend their noses that
stood by, not considering that he which in the general resurreccion should
raise all men's bodies already many hundredth years before turned into duste,
could raise a dead body even newlye putrifyed: She (I tell you) thus
thynking, said: Lord, by this time he stinketh. For he has been dead four
days. Jesus therefore did with a little rebuke, stir up the inconstant, and
wavering woman's faith, saying: have thou forgotten how I told thee even now,
that if thou did believe, it should come to pass that by thy brothers
death god should be glorified? Al they therefore depending and staying in the
expectacion, and upon hope of a new wonderful miracle, the stone by the
Lord Jesus commandment was removed.

And furthwith all their minds and iyes pawsing as men in doubt, our Lord
Jesus lifting up his iyes, to teach us thereby yt whatsoever great thing we
do, we ought to refer it to God as author thereof, and withal, to declare
unto the standers by, that himself should by gods power do it, what thing
so ever he should do, said: father, I thank the because thou have heard my
desire, not because that it is an uncouth or a time during thing to me: for I
know that forasmuch as thy will and mine is all one, thou dooeste always
hear me if I ask any thing of the. For neither do I will any thing yt thou
willest not, but this prayer I make because of the people that stand by: to
thencent that when they have seen the miracle, they may believe that I do al
things in earth after thy will, and that also I am sent into the world to set
furthe the glory of thy name amongst men. When he had spoken thus to his
father, he calls out the dead man by name, saying: Lazarus come forth. He
could even with a beck alone have made him that was buried reuy^e and come out
of the grave: but this great stern voice, was a token of great power, wherewith
the sinful soul that is far of from the syghte of God, being buried in
darkness of sin, and rotten with filthiness of enorme crimes, may rise
again, and come forth into the light of truth. And without delay, he that was
dead and buried, came out byan by at the voice of him that called upon him
before all their iyes And he came forth before them, his body sound and whole
of truth, but he came with all ye clothes upon him that he was buried in, that
al they might know him to be the same man whom they buried in such apparel
three days before. For as corses were wont to be done withal, his feet were
tied with lystes: and his hands bound with sepulcher bands, his face also
bound with a napkin. And now than was this a wunder, the dead corse did not
quiver and stir little and little, and so show likelihod of life returning
again as for the more part it happens in them, whom we read to be raised to
life by good and holy men, but this man that had been dead four days space,
came suddenly to life again at the commandment of a word. And to make the
miracle seem greater, he, both tied and hard fast bounden, sodeinly cu^meth
forth abrod out of ye deep secret place of a cave. Than (lest any thing should
want to the full perfect belief of the miracle,) Jesus said to the man's
friends: be use him and let him go, that his mouyng and lusty quick pace
may declare that the manne does not only live but has also his health. Jesus
could have made the bands to have lewsed of their own accord: but since with
their service they had thoroughly the doing of al things, by all ways and
proves they both excluded suspicion of forgeyng the thing, and confirmed the
certayntie of the miracle. The twoe sisters advertised Jesus, than being
absent, of their brothers sickness by other men. And in the absence of Jesus
the man dyed, he was buried, he was kept till he stonke withal. He was mourned
for, with solemn recourse of much people. The sisters themselves told Jesus
of his death, they showed him the grave: when he had much people waityng upon
him, the stone is taken away with other men's hands, and with other me^nes
hands, was he lewsed that came forth of the grave. Here is nothing left to
the unfaithful that they could lay for their excuse. Neither did Jesus, when
he had wrought so notable a miracle, speak any stout word of himself. He did
not check and reprove the people because their accustomed manner was to
slaundre, and find fault with his miracles: he requires no thank of Lazarus
or of his systers.

Therefore, many that came of friendly duty to Martha and Marie, Lazarus
sisters, when they had seen so notable a miracle, they believed yt Jesus was
Messiah, and stacke to his doctrine, the power whereof they saw before their
face to be so great and effectual. And truly some of them returnyng home to
Jerusalem, showed to the Phariseis the things that Jesus had dooen a little of
Bethania. Therefore, when this great act being so exceadyng wondrous was
heard of ye Bishops and Phariseis, who for the evident declaracion of gods
power, ought to have wurshipped Jesus, and to have been joyous on Gods behalf,
they being styrred with the pricks of envy, cannot now for bear any longer,
but (to cause the thing seem more lawefully dooen) they call a wieked counsayl,
wherein they consult among themselves, by what way and means they may resist
such great daungiers. For albeit that the respect of private wealth, and
sickness of soul set the^ on a woodnes against Jesus that was beneficial
toward al men, yet will they that this matier do apperteyn unto the health and
preseruacion of all the people. What is your aduyce (say they) to be dooen?
This manne does many wonderful things, and excedeth himself daily in doing
of miracles. If we suffer him to go on as he has begun, it will come to
pass, that like as now many of the people does think hiely of him, so within
awhyle al will take him for Messiah. Which thing if it hap to be, and the brute
thereof cum to the Romans (that is to wit) that the nation of the Jews has
forsaken the emperor and are fallen to a new king of their own, which
Romans do well know that of late a certain king has been looked for of the
Jews which should set the nation at liberty, the Romans will make cruel
war against us: And so with all the profane Gentiles shall keep with force
this holy place, and with man's slaughter make havoc and destroy the whole
flock of the Jews.

Whereas this their advice, under the pretense of a public health, tended to
the destruction of Jesus Christ, thautour of all health, yet was it thought
unto Cayphas to slender a device and to weak a counsel. He was the bishop of
that year. For that dignity, as though within a while it should fail for
altogether, had ceased to be a continual room: but being a benefice set to
sale, it was fined for every year to the princes. Therefore he that professed
him self chief prelate of religion, being more wieked then all other, blames
the cowardship of them that with deliberate counsel, did further debate the
matter, whether Jesus were to be put to death or nay: whereas it, (thought he)
all other things set aparte, was to be dooen incontinently and with speed. You
(says he) that sit deliberatyng whether this fellow that does such
things, is to be put to execucyon or no, seem not to wey the matter as it is:
nor ye consider not how it is profitable and expedyent for every man, that
this one should dye for the people, rather than that he being saved, all the
people should perish. This saying came not of the bishops own mind, that was
ungracious and full of murder, but by reason of the office of priestehode,
which he than bare, the spirit of prophecy did bring forth a godly
prophecy by the mouth of a wi^ked man: which said prophecy did give
foreknowledge how it should come to pass, that Jesus should by his death
redeem and save the Jews: not only to bring this to effect, that such of
the Jews as did believe should be saved alone, but that those also among the
Gentiles which lived in diverse countries dispersed through the wholle world
(but to this end appointed that they should once be made the children of God
through faith of the gospel,) might be counite together, and that the man of
I^de, the manne of Ethiope, the Greek, the Scithian, and the Britan, should
join together in fellowship of a common universal church.

Now therefore, the Phariseis being stablished with this voice of the wieked
bishop, do in their hertes certainly determine (which thing they often before
attempted as occasion served) to rid Jesus out of the way, by all means
possible, as though thereby they well provided for the preseruacion of the
common weal: and again, lest their ungracious act should be the less
sinful, they color their impiety: supposing they had now found out matter
to stiere and provoke all the people likewise, openly and by the law, to put
Jesus to death, as a hurtefull man to the whole nacyon of the Jews: neither
neded they (as they thought) any fault or any new cause to lay to his charge.
Jesus therefore, from whom nothing was hid, although the rumoure of the people
did not advertise him of the Phariseis and priests pretenced malice, showing
himself a very man, al ye while he was in Jury came not abroad, lest he
should increase their fury. But he conveyed himself a far of, from the
bonds of the city of Jerusalem, the killer of Prophets, and went to the
city of Ephraim: whereunto the deserte was nigh, signifying by that deed, that
the wicked Jews should forgo their Synagogue: and a new people (that should
not stick to the unfruitful works of Moses law, but to the faith of the
gospel) should be gathered together, and a church made of them: which people
should also (as the significacion of the Hebrew word betokens) grow of a
small beginning into an exceadyng great thing: for Ephraim, to the Hebrews,
signifies increasing. Jesus therefore tarryed here with his few disciples,
which though they were woefully afearde of themselfes also, yet durst they not
forsake their Lord.

Now the very time was come, sothly appointed of the father, when Christ should
be offered up in sacrifice for the salvation of mankind. For that most
religiouse day of the Jews was at hand, which they call phase, that is to
we^e, a passing over: (in English Easter) by that name calling to their
remembrance that deed, which was, that long before ye time the blood of a
lamb stricken on the posts, did save the Hebrews from the sword of the
Angel that killed the Egypcians: and those only houses passed over that had
their posts marked with the lambs blood. Now therefore before the feast which
was very nie, many went out of diverse coasts of Palestine to Jerusalem,
there being purified with ceremonies of their law, to solemnise ye most holy
feast. And to let us know that nothing is more vnreligiouse than Jewish
religion, which consists in visible things: and since also ye while they take
great head with much vain deuocio^ lest they ouerslip any thing that was
prescribed them of Moses, or that was added to by the Phariseis: they be not
loath to do that thing on the most sacred day, which is of al things most
wieked, that is to wete, to shead ye blood of an innocent man. Therefore, when
there was a great throng of people together, and many of the^ knew Jesus,
whose manner was to be present at such feasts, they wondered yt he was not
there present: and standing in the temple, they talked one to an other what
should be the cause that contrary to his customable manner, Jesus was absent
from so solemn and high a feast. From which solemnity would not he yet
altogether absent himself, but to thentente he might come more looked for, he
deferred his cumming until such time as he thought best. Furthermore the
bishops and Phariseis suspecting him sumwhere to hide himself for fear, they
traueyled and gave a commandment yea with an authority also, that if any man
knew where he were in secret, that they should show it that he might be
apprehended. With these approved holy customs, the bishops and Phariseis, that
were guides and masters of religion, prepared themselfes to the feastful day,
but in the mean while they unawares procured the salvation of the world.

The.xii. Chapter.

Jesus therefore knowing that they had concluded upon his death, and that the
time also was nigh, when as he had determined willingly to be offered in
sacrifice, an unspotted lamb for the salvation of the world, he would no
longer keep himself in secret, but as one offreyng himself to be a
sacrifice, the seventh day before the feast of Easter, in which day the
Jews were wount at a solemn supper, as it were, to ^aste before hand the
pascall lamb, he returned again to Bethania: both to call to remembrance
the lately done miracle, and also to impriente the hope of the resurreccion in
the minds of his disciples, whom he knew should be with his death excedyngly
troubled in mind: For there dwelt Lazarus whom he had a few days before
raised from death to life. And the place was more notable for being nigh to
Jerusalem. There therefore a supper was made ready for Jesus. Martha served him
at supper: But Lazarus was one of the number that sat at supper with him, to
make it more certain to them all, that it was no vision nor ghost which lately
was seen to go out of the grave home to his house, forasmuch as he had now
lived after his death many days, and had also, both commoned and eaten with
other.

There did Mary, (who with a siguler love, loved the Lord Jesus ardently,)
come to the feast, as well for many other causes, as for the late benefit
showed upon her brother: and shed upon Jesus head sitting at the table, a
great quantity of very precious oyntmente, which was made of the best kind
of Nardus, to the mountenaunce of a pound: Insomuche that the whole house was
filled with the savor of the oyntmente. And yet was the woman's (such love as
has not been heard) not herewith content, but anointed his fete with
oyntmente, and washed them with tears, and wiped them with her here: not that
she thought Jesus did delight in such delicacies, whose moderate sobriety she
knew, but great ferue^cie of love caused her do as her mind gave her, without
stay of herself: for truly she knew not nor considered what she did: but yet
through doing honor, she gave aduertiseme^t before hand of Jesus death and
burial, and was a figure of the church, which should embrace with godly
honor, the lord whom the Synagogue despised.

The disciples thought much at the bestowing of this oyntmente as a thing
wastfully spente, but specially Judas Iscarioth was moved withal: to whom as
to the wurst of them al, the purse was committed, to the intent that the wurst
man should be the disposer and laier out of the naughtiest thing: he was wont,
as the manner of the^ that has the handelyng of money is, which is common to
many, to steal privily somewhat thereof to himself: not with a single pure
mind depending of the maistership and authority that Jesus had over him, but
even than making provision for himself, wherewith he might live, after he were
departed out of Jesus fellowship. He therefore, repining against Mary said: to
what purpose is it to loose so precious a thing? For neither is our Lord and
master delighted in such nyce things, neither is this sumptuousnes seming
for our feast. And in case this woman had been determined to bestow so
precious a thing, when it had been given, it might have been sold and the
price thereof given to the poor. This (ye wot well) had been more godly and
more seming for our master and us too. Albeit in deed the other Apostles also
did speak these things of a simplicity, and mente none evil therein, yet had
Judas a far unlike mind, though his words were like unto theirs: for he
had no care of the poor men's cause, but he kept the purse: and the thing
which friends sent of their free good will, did he full unjustly keep, and
thereof privily stole somewhat, even than showing some proof of himself, how
unfit he is for the ministracion of Gods word, whose mind the inordinate
desire of money does possess.

But Jesus did so apease his disciples murmuryng, that yet he did not openly
disclose the malice of Judas, and in such wise he took Mary's part, that he
signified, how of his own voluntary will, he should dye. For our Lord Jesus
most coueted to have all folk induced to believe: not that by compulsion of
man, but by his own good aduisement, he should suffer death for the salvation
of man, even as he would and when he would. Grudge ye not (says he) at this
woman's obsequiousness and benefit toward me. This cost is not lost, but
this honor is done and bestowed against the time of my buriyng, which honor
this woman does now preventing the thing, for than shall there lack wherewith
to anoynte. You do judge well of me, that being alive I have alwaie refused
such plesante things, yet I will that my death and burial be cumly and
honorable: do not have envy at this my honor, which is bestowed on me, that
shall shortly depart hence.

Ye shall have always with you ready at your hand, great plenty of these common
sort of poor men, whose need ye may succor: ye shall have me but a while.
And because many of Jerusalem came much to Bethania by reason of the nynesse,
and because of Lazarus, in that he was a notable and a tyche man, and thereby
known to many, (but yet was he the more known through the fame of the late
done miracle:) it was not unknown abroad that Jesus was at Bethania. And an on
very many came thither out of the city thick and threfolde, partly to see
Jesus (whose fame and renown, the miracle that was so notable, did much
increase,) partly also they came to see Lazarus, whom they heard to be raised
from death to life. The curiosity that is naturally given to man, caused them
thus to do. Moreover, envy and despite against Jesus had so blinded the minds
of the priests and the Phariseis, that it did not suffice their malice to put
Jesus to death, but they fell in device also how to make Lazarus away, against
whom they could lay no color or likelihood of any fault. They had cast out of
their Synagogue ye blind man, because he did boldly defend Jesus glory among
the^, now their envy was grown to such malice, that they were in mind to
kill Lazarus, a man of great estimacion and power, of whom they were never by
any word or deed provoked and offended, and against whom they could not
imagine any thing: and kill him would they for nothing else, but because many
Jews being moved with so manifest a miracle, did fall away from the Phariseis
conspiracy, and believed in Jesus.

But the day following when as a great route of men (which were assembled at
Jerusalem because of the feastfull day,) had knowledge that he would leave
Bethania and come to Jerusalem, to do him honor came they to mete him with
branches cut of from the palm trees, wherewith they strawed the way that he
should go by. For of this tree were their garlandes made that gate victory,
and it was a tree perteyning to triumphs, alwaie grene, long and hye, hard to
be climed upon: but of a pleasante sweet fruit, and by a certain peculiar
power of nature it rises up against the weight and burden that is laid upon
it. And that saying which is written in the Psalms, Osanna, praise and honor
be to him that being looked for of us, cummeth in the name of the Lord, was
cried up aloude, like as the people is wont to publishe and witness a common
joy. Jesus also (ever before this time bearyng a full low sail, and a
contemner of worldely glory,) was than content to come to Jerusalem with a
new solemn portely show. For after he had gotten unto him an ass, he rode
upon her, whereas before he was wount to walk his iourneyes on foot, partly to
teach his how vain is the honor of this world, partly to ratify that
which Esaias prophesied of him, for it is written. Fear not daughter of Sion,
behold thy king cummeth to thee, meke and gentle, sitting upon the colte of an
ass. Such a pomp certainly becummeth well the king of the spiritual
Jerusalem, which is the church.

The apostles verily at that season understood not these things, supposyng
the^ to be done by casualtie, but after that Jesus through death, through his
resurreccion, and by sending down the holy ghost was glorified, than co^ferring
the thing that was done with the words of ye Prophets, they well perceived, that
the words which the people cried out a loud, and also the thing that he thus
cummyng did, was written of him. For there were some which looked for such a
king as worldly kings be. Christ's pleasure was to have those men's expectacion
decided, declaring that the kingdom of the gospel does not consist and
stand in the aid and defenses of this world, but in mekenes, and heavenly
doctrine. This great and notable affeccion that was in the people, came of
those men's stirryng and prouocacion, which had of late been present a little
before at Bethania, when the Lord raised Lazarus out of his grave, and so they
made relacion of that thing which they saw with their iyes, to other. And
thereof came it that such a preace of people came forth to mete Jesus, because
they had learned of them that saw it, how that this wondrous miracle, such
one as had never been heard of since the beginning of the world, was wrought
by him. And according as the thing brought with it in open apparaunce, a
certain godly power, so had he such honor given unto him, as was never given
to any prophet.

That thing drove the minds of the priests and phariseis almost into
desperacion: neither do they repent them of their wicked enterprise, but there
was a spiteful mutteryng among them, and they said: ye perceive that with all
our crafty policies and devices against him, we go nothing forward in our
purpose, but ye more we do resist, the more does his authority florishe, and
the more earnestly does the people favor him. Before this he had but few
disciples, behold now the whole world falls from us to him, in somuche that
now it is sumwhat dangerous for us, openly to arest him. The ungracious
phariseis had this communicacion, to the intent they might thereby stir and
provoke each one another to set on, and suddenly to come upon the lord Jesus,
with more succor and greater guiles: wherefore they did not atchieue and
accomplish this mischievous act, before they had the graund consent of the
Phariseis, the scribes, the priests and the ancient rewlers, the people also
(as in deed their mind is unconstant) being inflamed with the same fury and
wicked mind, yea and with Pilate the viceroyes authority: neither yet
without deceytfull craft brought in withal by Judas the traitor. The people
notwithstanding did that time so favor Jesus, that the Gentiles also which
for religion sake came to Jerusalem there to pray, much desired to see Jesus.
The reverence of that temple was so great, that out of far countreies many
went thither of devotion to serve god, and for religion sake. Uerily from that
time, a certain likelihood of a thing to be, was showed, that is to wit, that
the Gentiles being before Idolaters, should have recourse and come to be of
Christ's church (whereof that temple at Jerusalem bare the figure) and should
lovingly embrace Jesus with due religion, whom the Phariseis rejected. These
folk therefore being very desirous to see Jesus, of whom they had heard so
wonderful things, yet they were bashefull, and with shamefastness let to
approach unto him: for in deed they coueted not only as he passed by lightly to
se him in the throng, but also to salute him, and to hear him speak nere
hand: these persons, I say, do come to Philip, to whom (by reason of
nighnesse of country, for he was borne in Bethsaida a city in Galilee of the
Gentiles) they were known: and their cummyng to him was, that he would make
them way into Jesus. For they gave knowledge that they were very desirous to
se Jesus. Philip brake the matter to Andrewe, they being companions of one
city. For Andrewe was of a greater authority with the lord, because he was
first of all called. They both therefore went to Jesus, and declared unto him
that certain folk there was, not Jews, but Gentiles, which out of measure
desired to se him, if he would vouchesafe to admit them.

But when Jesus was certified by his disciples that the heathen also longed to
see him, when as so leudly he was contemned of the Phariseis, and priests,
upon this occasion he began to open his death to his disciples, and what great
fruit it should bring, not only to the Jews, but to all the world: for
because in like manner as the miracle of raising up Lazarus, alone did draw and
provoke not only many Jews, but also Gentiles to his love: so should his
death and resurreccion move and draw all the countries of the whole world:
Than Jesus gave answer to his disciples that showed him the godly mind and
affeccion of the heathen, and said: ye did hear the Jews say with a loud
voice: blessed is he that cummeth in the name of the Lord. Ye see the Gentiles
draw to me with like desire, and why? Because now the time is nygh, that when
the Phariseis believes that the son of man shall be utterly extincte, than
shall he be most glorified with all nations of the world. It is a new kind
of glory, and by a new way must it be gotten. I being alive, have drawn ^ewe
to me: but when I am dead, Except the wheat corn fa^l into the ground and dye.
my fame shall be spread abroad, and draw mo than my bodily presence has done.
Ye be loath to hear of death, yet take that for most sure, unless the wheat
corn be cast into the ground, and being buried there, do rotte and dye, it
shall bring forth no fruit, but it only alone abides safe: But if it be dead
and lie buried in the ground, it sprouteth up again with much gain of
fruit, yealdyng for one corn an hundredth, and now the corn standing
joyfully upon the ground, garnisheth the fields abroad in many places, and
with a plenteous increase enricheth the countreye. The thing that is commodious
to many is the more to be coueted, and the salvation of many is to be redeemed
with the death of a few. So to bestow life is no perishemente, but auau^tage,
and this is not to loose the life, but to keep it. For the soul does not
perish which departs from the body, nor the body does not altogether go
to destruction, that in time to come shall live more blessedlye, and be
immortal. Therefore whosoever loves his life in this world, while he evil
keeps it he loses it. Contrary, whosoever hates his life in this world, and
for the furtheraunce of the ghospel casts it into perils, and betaketh it to
death, he does not loose life which he so bestows, but keeps it: and for a
mortal, a short, and a wretched life, shall receive at the time of
resurreccion, an eternal and blessed life. In like manner, he that keeps the
wheat corn loses it, that even else of it self would perish, but he that
sows and burieth it in the ground, in conclusion well saves it, within a
while after to receive the same again with auantage: which he thought he had
lost,

There is therefore no cause why my death should trouble you: which death once
shall be followed, to the intent that you, which shall be folowers of death, may be
partakers both of glory and immortality. I as the autour of the ghospels
business, do bestow my life willingly for the salvation of the world, and my
fathers glory. You shall be ministers of the same business, reporting and
publishing abroad through the whole world with your preaching, those things
that I have both wrought and taught. The Same thing that the Bishops and
Phariseis do now with great craft devise against me, shall the wicked execute
upon you, which ungracious persons loves the world more than God: and
whiles full folishly they keep this life, they loose everlasting life, and cast
themselfes headling into everlasting death. If one profess himself my
disciple or minister, it behooves the same to follow me their master and Lord.
For it is mete that the servant be not pulled away from his Lord, neither in
prosperouse things nor aduersant. Whom I have partakers and companio^s in
affl^cious and adversity, them will not I di^^euer from the fellowship of
felicity: but wheresoever I become, there shall also my servant be. And
though the world reiecte me never so much, yet shall my father enhaunce me to
glory. And in case any manne behave himself as a faithful servant to me, him
(in recompense of transitory harms, and for ignominy wherewith he lives in
rebuke among men) my father shall bewtifie and honor with eternal felicity,
and true glory. For my father shall acknowledge not me only, but the ministers
also of his only son, and shall vouchesafe like reward upon the^, whom he
has known to suffer such like things as his said son did suffer:
Affliccion had here, has of truth his anguishe and pain, by reason of the
infirmity of man's body. But the salvation of many well considered, the
felicity of everlasting life well poudered, which are redeemed and recovered
with a short torment, ought to convince this quiuering fear of man's nature.
And if in time to come, ye feale that nature irketh and repineth against the
dreadful torments and deaths, wherewith ye be menaced and threatened, do not
utterly sterte away as men discomfeited and clearly overcome, but let
valiantues of mind always depending of the father of heavens aid, vanquish in
you the feebleness and cowardnesse of man's nature. But even now also I feel mine
own soul troubled in my self, because the day of my death is nigh. I see a
sore greuouse tempest imminent and hang over me. What shall I say, or whither
shall I turn me? shall I yield to the infirmity of the body, which abhors
death? Shall I flee to the succors of the world? or shall I for the love of
mine own life neglect the life of the whole world? no not so. I will
accommodate and apply my self to my fathers will. My natural infirmity,
being sore encumbered with the horriblenesse of death, shall say unto him:
Father, if it may be, keep me safe from this instant peril of death. But
charity, which much desires man's salvation, furthwith puts to this
saying: Yet rather for all that (says she) (in case it be fit and expedient
so to be) let the coueted death come, when as after the will of the spirit,
which does no where disagree with thine, I have willyngly and wittingly
offered my self to death. Now bring thou it to pass, that my death and
resurreccion may cause thy name to be notable and famous in all countries of
the world, that when thou art once known, the people honoring thee, may
attain to eternal salvation.

After our Lord Jesus had thus prayed, with his iyes lift up into heaven, the
voice of the father came from heaven saying: I have glorified my name, and will
after this more excellently set it forth. For already his name through so many
miracles was waxed great and much known among men by his son, but most
chiefly by raising Lazarus from death to life. And soon after would he augment
the glory of his name in all ye nations of the world by the cross, by the
resurreccion, and by the ascendyng up into heaven, by sending down of the holy
ghost, and by the preaching of his Apostles. Moreover the route of people
which stood not far of, when they heard the voice that came down from
heaven, because they took little head, neither was it evident to them unto whom
that voice did appartayne, that cumpany of people (I say) agreed not in their
opinions of the thing. For some did interpretate the voice that they thought
they heard to be a thu^der, for the voice came out of the clouds. Some again
did interpretate the thing more favorably, saying some angel did speak unto
him. But Jesus to make them take more head, and also to put away from him all
suspicion of praise, says: this voice which is neither noise of thundres nor
voice of angel, but the voice of my father which has heard my prayers, came
not for me who know in my self my fathers mind, but it is come for you, that
ye may understand that my father and I do agree, and that whatsoever I do, he
being the author, I do it for your salvation sake. You have heard what my
father has promised as touching my death. Now shortly must Satan be wrestled
withal for good and all, who is the prince or rather tiranne of this world, and
through sin has hitherto kept al the^ in death, which love this world. Now
is the cause of the whole world drawn into judgment, but falsehood being
reproved, truth shall come to light: And whiles the prince of the world, the
author of death, thinks himself a conqueror, he shall through death be put
from his tyranny. For all men shall be pardoned their sins through faith of
the gospel. Sin once taken away, the tirantes force and strength is qualled,
who is valiant and mighty in no other weapon save sin only. And as he that
shall think himself to have the victory shall suddenly be expelled his
kingdom: so I that shall be thought utterly made away, after I be lifted up from
the earth, will draw all things on every side unto me, of right chalengyng
that thing unto me, which hitherto he has kept in possession by tyranny.
Furthermore in that Christ said: When I shall be lift up from the earth
(because the saying was doubtful, and yet right fit to express ye thing,)
he would signify what kind of death he should dye. For they that are hanged
up upon a cross, hang up on hye that all men may see the^ a far of: And he
gave them withal a priuey warning of the old story, which shows that a
brazen serpent being a figure of Christ, and set up upon a hie pole, did give
to all them that beheld it, though it were a far of, present help against
the mortal wounds of serpents.

And yet were there some in that assembly of people, which did coniecte
(because of the forespeakyng of death) that he had spoken of the tormente of
the cross. And thereupon they stood in argument, that he was not Messiah which
published that himself should dye: whereas scripture gives to Messiah, power,
and a kingdom eternal. For thus writes Daniel: His power is an everlasting
power, which shall not be taken away: and his kingdom shall remain for ever.
And again Micheas the Prophet speaks thus: His outgoing has been from the
beginning, and from everlasting. Also Esai says: And there shall be no end of
his peace. Yea and moreover the prophecy of the psalms does promise him a
perpetual priesthood, saying: Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchisedeck. Than say they therefore: We know by the law, that when Messiah
shall come, he shall abide and continue for ever. What means it therefore that
thou say, it shall come to pass that the son of man shall be lift up from
the earth? but and if to be lift up from the earth be to dye, and if thou will
have the son of man (so often as thou speak of him) to be taken for thee
thy self, either shall thou not dye, or else that son of man is not Messiah,
if the prophecy say truth.

Well, because these sayings were spoken of malice: Jesus made no answer to
them. Uerely, he might have answered that he was not only man, but also God,
and that he should of truth die, as concerning his natural man's body, but yet
so that it should so one rise again, nor yet should that death let the
perpetuity of his kingdom, because it should not be worldly, but a spiritual
kingdom. But neither did they understand these mysteries, nor yet was there
opportunity to declare them openly. He does only council them that (setting
aparte all blyndenesses of heart) they would cease their crying out on the
truth that was come to light, specially seeing that it should within a while be
taken away. Not that the light of the gospel should ever be thoroughly
abolished, but that they should not after this hear of his own mouth his
doctrine, nor see him work any miracles, which might give them sight to see
their folly, and repent them of it: yet a little while (says he) is the light
with you. Wherefore, while ye have this light, walk ye, and amend since there
is good cause, lest the light being suddenly taken away, dark night come on
you, and than ye desire all in vain, the thing that is taken from you, which
now being offered unto you, ye do contemn. Whosoever follows the blind
affeccions of his own mind, walks in darkness, and knows not whither he
goes: and whiles he believes that he does well and godly, he falls into
death. I am the light of the world: whosoever believes in me, shall not err or
swerve from the truth. The children of darkness flies from the light, while
you therefore have light, believe on the light, that ye may be seen the children
of light. He that believes, sees, whosoever believes not, the same having sight, is
blind.

These things spoke Jesus, and departed and hid himself from them. But though
he had done so many miracles before them, yet believed not they on him, that the
saying of the Prophet Esaias might be fulfilled, which he spoke: Lord who
shall believe our saying? and to whom is the arm of the Lord declared? Jesus
spoke no more to them at that time, lest he should the more provoke the fury
of them, whom he knew to be very prone unto all mischief, but he went thence,
and hid himself from them, and so would he through his absence and with
silence assuage their cruel woodnes, and there withal admonishing us by the
way, that (according to his exaumple) as often as we have to do with wilful
persons, and that there is no hope to do them good, we than ought to give
place for a time, lest not only we do them no good at al, but also make other
the wurse. For what is more to be lamented, than the minds of those Jews? For
where as our Lord Jesus, through so many, so clear, and so wonderful
miracles wrought before their iyes, ought to have brought them most surely to
have believed his sayings, yet did they stand stiffly in their unbelief, no
doubt but even blinded with envy, hatred, ambicion, avarice, and other
ungracious concupiscence of the mind. And even so Esai long ago did prophecy
that some such should be, saying: Lord who has believed our words, and to
whom is the arm of the Lord opened? Uerily, therefore they did not see the
power of God in Jesus his doings, because being blinded with their malice,
they did not believe.

Yea and they did not believe, because they would not cast away their naughty
desires. And this also did Esai speak of before: He has (says Esai) blinded
their iyes, and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their
iyes, and understand with their hearts, and should be converted, and I shoud
heal them. For they seeing did not see, and understanding did not understand.
And contrary to their own salvation, they made all they could against him, at
whose hand alone, salvation was to be hoped for. These things told Esai long
ago, who being spiritually inspired, saw with the iyes of prophecy, the
glory of the son of God, which (in time to come) he should have being a very
man. And he prophesied that he saw, and the thing which he prophesied should
be, have we seen done.

Yet for all this, these men's unbelief did not exclude the salvation of other
that did believe: for many gave faith to Jesus, not only of ye vulgar people,
but of the nobles also. But nevertheless, the men of wurship durst not
confess the faith openly, for fear of the Phariseis, which had made a decre,
yt whosoever did confess himself to be a disciple of Jesus, should be
excommunicate and thrust out of ye Synagogue. Over this, those which have
preemine^ce in the world, ignominy irketh them much. For as yet their faith
was not stable and perfect, but notwithstanding that, it was for that time, a
good beginning of an eua^gelicall mind, to think well of Jesus: though fear
and shamefastness let the^ to show it forth. Envy stopped some,
covetousness let other, and othersome did ambicion hinder, why they did not
with an whole heart cleave to Christ, for whose sake all things are to be
contemned. But because the holy ghost, which corroborateth a man toward
the gospel, was not yet given: many believed fearfully, as yet setting more by
man's glory than Gods. To be hiely placed in the synagogue was honorable
among men, but to be reiecte out of the wicked men's synagogue for Christ's
sake, is honor and praise before God. But fear and infirmity in men that be
of nature weak, soon obteineth forgiveness. Howbeit, those which were so
blinded with eiuill desires, that with a wicked conscience they spoke against
Christ, turned away the people from him, laid snares for him, and over that
craftily sought his death, it is needful (I say) that those perish, because
they would not be saved.

Another time again, Jesus going abroad in the sight of the Jews, now when
their fury ought to have been well appeased, the more to move them all to
believe, and to leave them no excuse at all that through their own wilful malice
would perish, declaryng what great profit should come to them that believed,
and how great destruction to them that did persiste in their unbelief, Jesus
(I say) cried and said: all you do profess that ye believe on God. But
forasmuch than as I am come from god, nor say or do any thing, unless he
being the auctour, whosoever believes on me, believes not on me, yt do nothing
of my self, but on him that sent me into the world. The world is full of
darkness, of error and sins. And therefore did I descend into the world
from my father, that is the fountain of al light, as a beam from the su^ne:
that errors being removed, and sins taken away, I should be the light of
the world. Truly by faith are the iyes of the blind opened, that they may
see light, and no more fall in darkness. All my doctrine, miracles, and what
thing soever I have done or shall do, to this has respect, that he which
believes on me, and puts his whole affiaunce in me, does not abide in
darkness: but being lightened with knowledge of truth, and pourged from al
sins of their old life, may through leadyng of the light, and by godliness
of the ghospel, proceed to everlasting life.

But if a man hear my words and obey them not, that hearing does so not
profit him, that for his unbelief he shall have a more sorry end: not that I
shall judge him. For I came not to condemn the world for the sinful
enormities thereof, but to save it, being once purged by faith. But neither yet
shall yt man escape terrible judgment, which when he has heard my words,
casts the^ away and contemns the^. Uerily at this present, I omit
nothing, whereby I may draw al folk to eternal salvation, nor any man shall be
lost through my fault. But whosoever shall contemn salvation, when it is
offered him, this self said word which I now speak, shall condemn him:
and shall in the last day rebuke him, because he did perish through his own
wilful malice. I (for my part) have invited men with promising them
rewards, I have feared them by threatnyng them with punishementes, I have
allured the^ with benefits, I have provoked them with miracles: I repel no
body from salvation, I set open a ready way for every man and woman to life.
What excuse therefore in the last day shall he pretend, that being so many
ways provoked to belefe, does continue still in his blindness?

If ye be wurshippers of God (as ye think your selves to be) in case ye have
the law in reverence, ye cannot contemn my words. For I do not speak of
mine own head, as they be wont to do, which do feine what they list to
their own praise and advantage, nor I do not teach things repugnaunte to
the law, but I do perform in deed, those things which the law did shadow
in figures, and prophesied should come. Futhermore, my father who is ye auctour
of the law, and from whom I came hither, has prescribed me what I shall say
and do. Therefore considering that I do obey his commandments in all
things, how can ye honor him, when as ye do contemn his ambassador? And
truly, the thing which he has given me in commandment, he has only
commanded it of love toward you, that you through beleuyng the things,
which I show unto you, may obtain everlasting life. Like as my father
thirsts the salvation of all, and seeks no man's damnacion: so verily do I
desire to have all saved, and will suffer none to perish, as much as in me
lies verily. Wherefore because I am well assured, that whatsoever he has
willed me to say, does perteyne to your salvation, therefore do I leave
naught unspoken that he has assigned me to say unto you. As touching this
good will of God the father toward you, and mine also, which thoroughly
agrees with my fathers will and mind, see there be no defaulte on your
behalf, wilfully sekyng your own damnacion, when as ye may attain to
eternal salvation.

The.xiii. Chapter.

OUr Lord Jesus, did with these kind of words, exhort ye wicked people
to provide for their own salvation, and to leave their ungracious purpose,
considering he had leafte nothing unassayed, whereby they might be recovered
and brought to a better mind and emendmente. Now then was no more a do, but
to enstructe his disciples (whom he had specially chosen, whom he should
shortly leave behind him, and whom he knew would be much discoumfited with
the death of their master) against the storm that was imminente and nigh at
hand, and thoroughly to pull out of their minds those Pestilences which
corrupts the sincerity of the gospel, that is to say, envy, hatred,
pride, ambicion, and graffe in them affeccions contrary to these, declaryng
therein the tokens of perfect charity, whose example and steps they should
follow in loving each other mutually, showing also the mannier of such
meekness and humility as has not been heard of, whereby one should preuente
an other sembleably with mutual benefits. Therefore the day before Easter
which the Hebrews (as was said before) did call Phase, that is to say, a
passover, forasmuch as our Lord Jesus from whom nothing was hid, knew the
time now to be at hand, when as himself, aunsweryng to the name of that
feastefull day, should pass out of this world, and go again to his father,
from whence he came: seeing he had always loved his Apostles, whom he had
specially chose^ to himself as his familiares and friends, which should not
yet depart out of the world, but should have a great and long battle with
the world, he did declare his continual love and charity toward them.
Neither the storm of his death, being now at hand, did put away the zele
and affeccion which he bare toward them, but at his very departing from
them, he did specially show tokens of a certain rare love, not that he had
fayntly loved them before, but because those things which he should printe
into their minds, at his going from them, might more diepely remain in
memory.

Therefore after that last and mystical supper was prepared, in the which
the holy memorial of his body and blood being given, he leafte unto us by
way of couenaunte a continual remembrance of himself, and purposed to make
a league of frendeshyp that should never by any means dye between us, although
he knew well enough that Judas Iscarioth by the suggestion of the devil,
already went about to betraie him, that he might be taken of the Jews: which
mind of Judas, the pestilence of covetousness had so possessed, that he
could not be called back from his ungracious wicked deed, for all the great
gentilnesse and mildness of his master toward him: and seeing Jesus knew
also that his father would suffer none of those things to perish which he
had delivered him to keep, and was well assured that himself should shortelye
go to his father, from whence he came, yet because he would utterly pull out
of his disciples minds, all ambiciouse desire, he rises from supper, meat
being already set upon the table, and laying aside his upper garments, whereby
he might in every condition show the similitude of a servant, he took a
towell and girded himself with it, furthwith he himself powered water into the
basen, and taking upon him the most vile and abject office after the worlds
estimacion, he began to wash his disciples feet. The Hebrews in deed did
accustomably bestow this manier of service upon their geastes and fre^des, but
yet this thing that Christ did was not only an exaumple of perfect
humbleness, but also had in it a figure of a mystical meaning: that is to
say, how that they which should prepare themselves to the office of
preaching the gospel, and would be partakers of ye table of the lord, ought
to be most pure from al earthly affeccions, notwithstanding none should attein
this purity, unless our lord Jesus with his goodness should wipe away all
the filthiness of our infirmity, who only was without all spot, and who also
being very man was after such a sort conuersaunt among men, that he trained
forth the whole course of his life without any spot of carnalitie.

Therefore when the lord of all things that are in heaven and earth, knowing
all things before, and having al things given him of his father, in his
apparel being girded after a sort of a servant, naked and carrying the
basin, came to Simon Peter, and kneled before him to wash his feet. Peter was
horribly afearde at this rare and strange exaumple of humility, on the on
side knowledgyng his own infirmity, on the other side considering ye majesty
of the Lord, which he had somewhat perceived by his miracles, and meruelouse
doctrine, although he had not yet fully known him to be god, nor as yet seen
him rise again, neither ascend into heaven, sit on the right hand of the
father, nor wurshipped through the whole world, with godly honors: but this
thing being known after, Lord do thou wash my feet?
did the more commend his exaumple of so notable humility. Peter therefore
refusing to be washed of his master upon the selfsame consideracio^ that John
baptiste was loathe to take upon him to baptize Christ, said: Lord what a
thing is this which thou go about? will thou wash my feet? I know who
I am, and who thou art: and furthwith to Peter's refusal, Jesus answered.
Suffer me to do that thing which I do, for it is no trifle, nor done in vain:
thou do not yet understand what this thing means, but hereafter thou
shall. And than thou shall well perceive the thing which I do, to have been
needful for thee. Peter was not stayed with this manier of answer, because he
understood it not, but made a further denial, saying: I will never suffer so
great a man as thou art, to wash such an ones feet as I am. But our Lord
to put away this earnest refusal, although it came of love, as it were, to
drive out one nail with another, by threatninges forced Peter to consent, If I
wash y^ not, thou have no part with me.
seeing he was not otherwise easy to be taught as yet, saying: Peter, why do
thou strive with me? If I wash thee not, thou canste not be partaker with me.
Either thou shalt be washed, or thou shall be removed from the fellowship of my
boorde and league. He must be pure and clean, whom I will admit into my
company. And Jesus spoke this, not of washyng the fete of the body, but
concerning the following of his so notable humility, and pureness of mind,
which ought to be excellent in those persons that profess the doctrine of
the gospel, and take upon the^ the cure of Christ's flock.

And although Peter that loved the Lord fervently, understood not than what
Jesus sayings meante, yet because it is greuouse to a lover to hear any
mention made of diuorcement or departure, as soon as he heard that he should
be separate from the coumpanie of him, whom he entierly loved, suddenly he
became more vehement in admitting him to wash his feet, then he was before in
refusing the same, and said. Lord rather then I would be put from thee, I do
not only suffer the to wash my feet (seeing it pleases the so to do) but
also my hands and my head. To this the Lord answered: he that is once washed,
has no need to be washed again, for the rest of his body being clean, there
remains nothing to be washed, but his feet: which eftsoon by treadyng on
the ground, gathers some filthiness.

Truly our Lord Jesus did signify by this parable, that it is not sufficient
for him that is a preacher of the gospel to have that common purity which
baptism and the profession of Christ's faith gives to al folks, except his
feet, that is to say, the affeccions of his mind, be often purged from all
impuritie of this world, from the which nevertheless no man can be pure,
unless he study to wash away many times, through the mercy of Christ, the
infeccion that he has taken by the cumpanie of men.

Therefore (says he) I will not wash again the rest of your body but only
your feet, for ye be clea^e: but not every one of you. In this excepcion our
Lord Jesus did touch the conscience of Judas Iscarioth, for he knew well
enough who should betray him to the Jews. The gentleness of Jesus was so
great, that although he knew him, yet would he not bewray him to other, nor
reiecte him from having his feet washed, neither would he put him back from
his holy Supper, nor yet from the communion of his body and blood: he does
only touch his conscience, who knew himself wel-ynough, that he might repent
and emende himself, after he should perceive that he was not unknown to the
Lord, whom he was determined to betray. Therefore was he the cause why Jesus
said, verily ye are clean, but not all.

When Jesus had finished this kind of service toward his twelve Apostles, he
put on again his garments, and sat down to sup with them, but in the mean
while he does once again put into their minds the exaumple of lowelines
which he had showed the^, lest they should forget the thing which was
necessary for the^, for he says: do ye not understand what is me^t by that I
have washed all your feet? ye call me master and Lord, and there is good
cause why ye should so do, for doubtless I am the same that ye call me: and
seeing I have washed your feet, that am in very deed your master and Lord,
you that are brethren and servants together, shall much less grudge each
one to serve an other continually. For I that am so far above you, have
therefore given you this example, For I have given you an example.
that you should not be loathe to do the like among you that be fellows, which
I have done to my disciples and servants, and that one brother, should be
ashamed to take upon him the pride of a tyrant over his brother, and likewise
a servant over his companion, seeing I, that may worthyly take upon me the
preeminence of this dignity, have humbled my self to wash your fete. Neither
is there cause why any manne should say, the thing that I do is to vile,
abiecte and servile. The greater a man is, the more it behooves him to humble
himself. The pestilence of ambicion does crepe in, even among evangelical
virtues. When ye shall do miracles through my name, when ye shall prophecy,
than ought ye chiefly to remember that thing which I have done this day unto
you: ye may not defend the authority of the gospel with high looks, with
pride, nor with violence, by other means shall that be attained. That thing
verily cannot be denied, which is certainly known by natural reason, that is
to say, how there is no servant greater then his master, nor the messenger
that is sent to do any other man's business, is greater then he that sends
him: ye know me to be your master, and hereafter ye shall know it better: ye
are my messengers, and I am the author of your Message. Therefore it were a
shame for you to be puffed up with pride, or to be fierce and cruel against the
flock that is committed unto you, or also among your selfs, considering ye
have found me so meke and courteous a Lord and master. Because now ye
understand this, if ye do it hereafter, ye shall be blessed after my doctrine,
which I so often repeat unto you, lest it should any way be forgotten. But
all you shall not obtain this blessing. In deed I have chosen you all to the
honorable roumth and office of an apostle. But all you shall not answer to
the worthynesse of this office. Blessed shall they be which shall use the
Apostles office after mine example. But there is among you that shall so little
follow this mine example toward his brethren and companions (with whom he
has heretofore been fellow like) that he shall lift up his head against me,
which am so great a Lord and such a master. But it was long agon prophesied
in the Psalm, Now I tell you before it come.
that this thing should be, where as it is thus said: he that shall eat my
bread, shall lift up his hele against me. I do now show you before it come
to pass, that this thing shall be, because when ye shall see that done which
scripture has spoken of before, ye may believe that I am he of whom it has
prophesied, and that nothing is done against me by chance or adventure, but
all this matter is moderate according to Gods determinacion. And like as he
that follows mine example is happy: so shall he be unhappy (whosoever he be)
that had rather follow that trayters doing that mine. For he shall have in time
to come many folowers of his naughtiness, which shall set more by money then
by the glory of mine name: and pretending the honor of the Apostles name,
shall traitorously misuse the office of an Apostle, and shall deface thapostles
office.

But the greater the dignity of this office is, so much the greuouser is the
fault to abuse the honor of that profession through playing the traitor: for
this I tell you assuredly, whosoever receives him that I send, receives me,
and whosoever receives me, receives him that sent me: for as I being my
fathers messenger, do nothing but according to his will, so you that be my
messengers and Apostles, if you faythfullye put in execucion the thing yt I
have commanded you, shall be so received of godly folks, as though I spoke
in you: like as my father speaks in me, who teach none other thing but that
which he has limyted.

When Jesus comfortyng his Apostles minds had spoken these words, forth with,
because he would make them the more afraid to follow the traitors exaumple,
and to the entente he would more vehementelye provoke the traytoure to amend,
he was troubled in spirit as one greuouslye vexed for the destruction of him,
which through his own malice, went about to procure to himself everlasting
death: and does again witness even by oath, that the thing which he spoke
before shall verilye come to pass. Forsoothe, I tell you yet once again
(says he) that one of you, which being but a few does here sit down with
me at one table, shall betraye me. This saying so often repeted did awake the
disciples minds, One of you shall betray me.
which else had been full heuye and pensite for the foresaid departure of their
Master. And every man's conscience (saving Judas) did coumforte himself,
because only one was noted to be the betrayer. But this addicion (of you)
did trouble them, neither did they doubt but the thing should at some time
come to pass, which our Lord said should be, and yet no man could suspecte
of an other so detestable a deed, forasmuch as they thought all other to be
of their mind, saving that every man mistrusted the fragilitie of man's
nature. Only Judas knowing himself giltye neither shrinketh thereat, nor was
ashamed, nor yet dreadful to be present at that holy repaste: and besides
that, in the mean while could abide the syghte of his master, to whom he
knew the whole purpose of his mind to be manifestely known. So pestilent a
thing was covetousness, and so it liked him to abuse the gentleness of his
master, being already well known unto him. Therefore the rest of the
disciples being heavy and careful, did behold one an other, to see if they
could perceive any token by countenance, by whom Jesus had spoken this: as
they which (without doubt) would furthwith have been fierce against him
that had determined so wicked a deed. Here truly was Simon Peter's mind set
on fire, who loved our Lord no man more, but hitherto (for ye more part) the
boldenes which he had by reason of his love toward his master, had evil
success. He had heard our Lord say before: Go back from me Satan, thou
sauoreste not those things that appertain to God: and even now he heard him
say. Thou shall have no part with me. Therefore when Peter did greatly desire
to be delivered from this doubtefull care, and to know assuredlye who he was
that went about so great a mischief, as one that would not have suffered him to
have si^te among them at that feast, yet durst not he himself be buisie to
ask Jesus who was that traitor, whom he advertised them of: but he beckened
to a certain disciple, to demand of Jesus, who was the manne he spoke of:
which disciple the Lord loved intierly, and used familyarly, and at thatsame
time he leaned upon the lords breast, by reason of which kind dealing and
familiar handeling of him, the manne did mourn, and was half dead, because
the lords death was at hand: but the Lord did coumforte and recreate him.

Therefore that disciple as he was then leanyng upon Jesus breast, said
secretly unto him: Lord who is he that shall dare enterprise such a
mischeuous deed? Jesus answered him saying: He it is to whom I shall give a
dipte soppe. And when he had dipped the bread in the brothe, he gave the
soppe to Judas Iscarioth, Simons son. The unhappy traitor was neither
ashamed therewithal, nor went about to amend himself, but with a shameless
countenance setting at naught the Lords knoweledge, and despisyng his great
gentylnesse, he took a token of frendshyppe at the Lords hand, whom he
would anon after betraye for a little money. And after he had received that
little morsel, the devil did fully possess his mind, and of a wicked man,
made him incurable.

Now when Jesus saw that the purposed malice of Judas would neither be
changed with shame nor fear (for he was almost bewrayed already, and should
have been in danger, if Jesus had disclosed him) he therefore sent him away
from the feast, and suffered him to do that ungracious deed, which he
already had committed in full will, and purpose of mind. The thing which thou
go about (says he) do it quickly. Judas knowing himself giltye, did
only understand that saying: none of the rest that sat at the table,
perceived wherefore Jesus had spoken this. For as goodness is nothing
mistrustfull, none of them could suspecte this, that he, to whom Jesus had
showed so many tokens of love, whom he seemed in a manner to prefer before
ye rest, in that he had the keeping of his money, who also sat right nere
unto him, in that feast, to whom even now our Lord gave a dypped soppe: no
man (I say) did mistruste that he durst enterprise so heinous a deed, as to
betraye him to death. And whereas Jesus had said, the thing which thou
dooeste, do it quickelye, some, because they knew Judas kept the purse, did
take it, That he should give some what to ye poor.
that the Lord had admonished him to bye some such things as should be nedeful
to the solemnisacion of that feastful day, or that he should distribute
somewhat to the poor.

For Jesus was often wounte to command him to do this, there by instructyng
and prouokyng us to be liberal to poor folk. When Judas had received the
soppe, and made as though he had not understand the Lords saying, he went
furthewith out of the parlour, where they supped. For it beecame not him to be
any longer present in the coumpany of holy folks, which had given himself
to the devil, and showed himself to Jesus so often incurable. And it was
night, a time betokenyng his mind that was blinded with the darkness of
couetise, which should withdraw himself from the light and make such haste
to do the work of the prince of darkness, that not so much as the undue
season of time ^^u^de move him to delay his purposed wicked deed. He lacked no
evil will before, but then Jesus had given him no power, to the intent that
here also it might be evidently perceived, how that no man could prevail any
thing against him except he would give license to his ungracious will, to
accomplish in deed that thing which he had determined in his mind.

When he therefore was departed which had made himself unworthy to be in
coumpanye, Jesus began to speak many things to his disciples, which
should partly coumforte and stablishe them, and partly arm them against the
storm that was at hand, utterly prientyng in their minds those things,
which at the first being ignorant, and afterward dulled with so row and
steape, they could not fully perceive, but yet they should afterward
understand the same. And first of all he showed his death to be at hand,
which although in the judgment of the world, it should seem full of
reproach, yet should it set forth both his fathers glory and his own. Now
(says he) this thing is specially in hand, for the which ye have heard me
pray: For now the time is come that the soonne of man which has seemed
hitherto poor, and as an abiecte, should after a new sort, become notable
among men: and that his fathers glory should likewise be set forth by him.
For as he sought not his own glory, but through his infirmity set forth his
fathers glory: so in like manier the father (which is the true fountain of
all true glory) shall glorifye his soonne before men, not by Angels; nor
Archaungels, nor yet any other creature, but by himself, declaryng to the
world how the fathers and the sons glory is all one, to the entente men
so may know on every side their mutual works, not that they can win
any thing by it, but that men by knowing the glory of them both, might obtain
true glory. In time to come, verily he shall thoroughly glorify his son in
his last cumming before all the company of heaven, and in the mean while
also, he shall furthwith gloryfie him by his own death (which shall be of
more force them al man's power) and anon after by his resurreccion and
ascencion. Wherefore my children let not my death discoumforte you, which
although it seem to come for want^ of strength, yet shall it be of more power
then my life.

Though it shall seem to be shameful and vile, yet shall it set forth both
my glory and my fathers: yea and though it shall seem an utter a bolishyng of
me, yet shall it bring salvation, both to you and to the whole world: let
these things comfort the heaviness of your minds. For it is expedient for
you that this mortal body of mine be withdrawn from your sight, and now
the ^yme is even at hand for it to be dooen. In the mean while use my
coumpanye as one that shall gooe shortelye from you, and printe well in your
hertes those things that I command you, or else as I have told the Jews, ye
shall seek me in vain when I am gone hence. For within a while I go away, and
that to such a place whither at this time ye cannot follow me. Therefore now
there is no more to do, but take my departure patiently, and fasten well in
your minds both my doctrine and the remembrance of me. A new commandment
give I unto you, that ye love together.
This is the thing that shall make you happy rather then the syghte of this
mortal body.

There be many precepts of Moses law: I now at my departure command you
one, and that a new precepte, that like as I have loved you, so one of you
love an other: I have used no tyranny against you, I have not coueted praise,
or luc^e, nor have got^en any worldelye commodity by you. I have loved your
welthe, yea and that freelye, and I have loved you even unto the death, for I
will willingly bestow this life for you. In like manner love you one an other.
Other men's disciples are known by their na^es, appaul, and by the observing of
certain ordinances of men: ye have learned none of these things. By this
only sign men shall know that ye be my very disciples in deed, if ye
have such mutual love among your selves, as I have effectuously showed to
you all: this is a rare thing among men, but yet is it the fruit whereby the
good tree is known.

Peter which was all set on fire with the love of his master (although he
took his death grievously, yet because he had said unto him, go after me
Satan, he durst no more move and moleste him, concerning that matter, but this
thing troubled Peter's mind, who loved him so well, that he could have no
leave to follow him, when he should depart from his friends. For it is a
great comfort if a man love one unfeignedly, to follow him in all chances
wheresoever he shall become. Therefore Peter asks: Lord whether go thou
that I may not follow the? To this Jesus answers: Thou may not
presencely follow me thither as I gooe, but hereafter thou shalt. Peter not
understanding as yet to what purpose Jesus spoke these words, whereas he mente
it of his own death, which they were not yet apt to bear well: Lord
(says he) why may not I follow thee? what perilles would I refuse for thee
which am ready to die for thee? His love being v^^a^ earnest in deed,
nevertheless as yet but worldly, not throughlye known to himself, caused him
thus to speak beyond his power. Jesus therefore to thentent he would frame
his successoure little by little, and utterly pull out of his disciples minds
confidence in man's power, like as before he had somewhat removed and put
back the same, at such time as Peter did boldelye advise him not to die, and
again he rebuked the said Peter when he had rashelye cast himself into the
water: and furthwith began to doubt, yea and but a while agooe also he was
controlled, for so much as when he would not have obeyed him at such time as
he went about to wash his feet: even so now he is taught not to trust in
his own strength, nor credit his own affeccions, but distrustyng himself, to
depend upon the help of Christ: what saieste thou Peter (says Jesus) how
stout things of thy self do thou promise us to do? will thou bestow
thy (...) for me? nay but very experience shall teach thee how true the
saying is which I speak even now, and could not be believed of thee (that
is to say) whither I go thou canste not follow me, the proof thereof is at
hand. For this be thou well assured of, that this night before the cock shall
crow (that is to say at the first cock crowyng) thou shalt have denied me
thrice: much less shalt thou be hable to save my life with thine. Before
the cock crow etc.
With these words our Lord did restrain Peter's stout saying, although it
came of great love, and therewithal warned other that in perils they should
not trust in their own strength: but whenever they brought to pass any
such thing, they should knoweledge it to come of the power and gift of God.
At these things Peter held his peace, as one that was not yet all free from
carfulness, concerning the betraying which Jesus had made men^^on of.

The.xiiii. Chapter.

WHen as at this saying (which sygnifyed that a certain strange and
ou^ragious tempeste was imminente and hanged over them, which storm should
also drive Peter that was most mannely, to so great error that he should
thrice the same night deny the Lord) when as (I say) the disciples were
therewith stricken, even to the hertes, and after Peter's exaumple every one
stood in dread of himself, Jesus being a master of most gentleness, did
with most fair and pleasant words comfort his troubled and sorrowful
disciples, saying: All these things shall be doubtless which I have told you
of beforehande. But yet there is no cause why ye should therewith be hertelesse
or dismayed, cruel things shall be dooen against me, and the like shall
after be dooen against you, nor I am not ignoraunte how great the infinnitie
of man's nature is. But notwithstanding, if you will put your whole affyaunce
in God and me: ye shall not need to fear any violence of wicked men: God is
almighty, and he alone may do more than all they that fearcelye stryuen
against us. And verilye even by Moses law you trust to him, and in case ye
do truly trust to him, it also behooves you to trust to me. I through him,
and you through me, shall have victory, if distrustyng your own proper aid and
defenses, ye will fyxe all your affiaunce and hope upon me. Nor death it
self shall be able to dysceyuer us: like as ye shall at a time be partakers
of affliccions, so shall you be of croune and glory. I will first show the
way and exaumple how to fight and to get victory, by me shall boldness be
given unto you, and felowshyppe of glory. Only trust unto me. Now than: In
my fathers house be many dwellynges ready (...) them that have victory: for
neither are rewards prepared for me alone, neither shall Peter alone follow
me, In my fathers house be in any mansion^s. etc.
but all those that cleaves unto me by charity and faith of the gospel,
shall be recompensed seuerallye, and have every one his reward prepared for
him. For unless I knew certainly that dwelling places were already prepared
for you, which are to receive you that shall in a while be taken out of the
hurly burly of this world into the felicity of everlasting life, I would
now beforehande have admonished you. That I do therefore go before to my
father, is to thentente I may there prepare a place for you also, whom I will
not suffer to be dissociate from me.

And now because I know it to be certain, that in my fathers kingdom every
manne has his mancion in a readiness for him: you have no need to be
careful of being recompensed, it only lies you upon hand to fight
manfully. And though I did go far away to prepare a place for you, yet is
there no cause for all that why ye should in the mean while think your self
succourlesse, for I shall come again unto you for to receive you wholye unto
me, never after to depart from me. For than wheresoever I am, there shall you
also be: there is no matter why to distruste your cummyng thither where as I
now go to before you, and in very deed ye do know whither I do go, and the
way thither. By this dark parable our Lord did give them some littell
knowledge that he should go to his father, but none otherwise than by death of
the cross. The thing that was gone to, was worthy to be desired and well
liked, but the way to it was thought worthy to be misliked and not to be
beloved. The disciples could not but know this, hearing the Lord so often
speaking thereof, but pen^fenes and obliuiousnesse made them ignoraunte in the
thing that they knew.

And so therefore Thomas being very desirouse to know certainly whyther our
Lord would go, says: Lord when we know not whether thou go, how can
we know the way thither? but rather where thou sayeste we know both, we be
in deed ignoraunte in both: with this blunte (although vehemente) saying,
Thomas did in a manner force our Lord to tell more plainly, whyther he would
go thence: which thing all they did (for a space) even long to know. Of
truth Jesus enstructyng, framyng, and fashyoning his, little by little, does in
deed teach the thing that they wish to know: but he does it as yet
covertly, to thentente that the thing might more depely be fixed in their
minds, which they should have much a do, and long time, to learn. That is
to say, that after he had left his mortality, he should return again
to his father, from whence he came before he was incarnate: but withal he
teaches that the way unto the father, is open unto no man, but by the
son, which only should open the way to heaven, which only should
instruct men's faith with heavenly knowledge, and should be the only
fountain of immortality: to whom whosoever did firmly stick, the same
should be without fear of death: Thomas (says he) how happens this,
that thou deniest the to know the way, unless thou as yet (percase) knoweste
me not at all? I am the way of truth and life
For verily I am the way, the truth and life. I said even now yt I do go
again to my father, and only do open for all tolke the way unto him: and
because he is come to by deeds fit and semyng for god, ye have the proof of
good life in me: and also because no man without me cummeth to the father, ye
have learned of me the truth. And if the fear of death do in the mean time
trouble your minds, know well that ye be sure of immortalitye, forasmuch
as I am life: No man cummeth to the father but by me. etc.
do ye only follow thither as I go before, beeleue and keep in mind that
which I have taught you, hope assuredly for the thing which I promise. If ye
ask whither I go, I go to my father, if ye desire to know the way whereby
ye may come thither, I say to you, no man cummeth to the father but by me*
wherefore you know both as well whyther I do go, as what wa^ye the iourneye
lies, except (paraduenture) ye be utterly ignoraunte who I am: verily if ye
had known me, ye had also known my father, yea (to say truth) ye have
already some way known my father, whom ye think to be unknown unto you,
nor ye have not only known him by the determinacion of the law, but ye have
also seen him doubtless. Our Lord Jesus did with this obscure saying sumdeale
advertise his disciples, that his father, of truth, was invisible, and not
only invisible to the bodilye iyes: but also that the mind of it own propre
nature could not see and perceive what he is, yet notwithstanding but that he
had been seen after a sort in his son, as while they see him in his soonne
rewlyng the wyndes and the sea, forcyng devils to obey, putting away with a
word sickenesses and diseases, were they never so incurable, and with a
word raising the dead to life. But the unlearned Apostles did not as yet
understand these hye mysteries, and yet for all that even as though they had
in very deed understand that which the Lord spoke unto them, they even leap
and skip of great affeccion to see the father: Imaginyng that the father
might be seen in such sort as they saw his son, such was there
simplicity as yet: albeit neither saw they the son thoroughly, which
behold him with bodily iyes alone.

Philip therefore, being more desirous to learn then the rest, speaks thus:
lord (quod he) thou tellest us that the father is seen of us, but would God
thou would grant that it might be lawful for us to see and look upon
thy father: then were our desires satisfied, and we would wish no more, nor
desire ought else. In deed we have heard much speaking of him, we lack only
the sight of him. Our lord does controull and correct Philips request, that
was so very rude and foolish, saying: Philip, have I been so long time with
the, and yet thou know me not? It is not the sight of my face that thou
know me by, but the right understanding of my power, virtue, and truth,
makes the to know me.

This my mighty truth and true power, is not seen with bodilye iyes, but the
mind and soul sees it. Therefore when as I am the very Image of my father,
in all things like unto him, He yt has seen me, has seen ye father.
and that by my deeds and words thou ought already to have known me,
(and verelye to have known is to have seen) how dareste thou be so bold,
with what countenance sayeste thou to me, show us the father? as though he
that has seen me has not seen my father. I mean not that my father is none
other than I, but that between us two is no unlikeness, or any thing uncommon as
touching the higher and our divine nature. In case thou canste not understand
what I say by natural reason, he sees also (I tell you) that believes. Thou
have heard me speak, thou have seen me do miracles* and therein surely thou
haste seen and heard of my father: do thou not yet believe that by an
inseparable copulacion of nature, will, and power, my father is in me, and I in
my father?

What thing soever I speak, I speak it of his mind: what ^ thing soever I
do, I do it after his mind: I am therefore always in him (by reason of
such a coniunccion of nature and will, as cannot be vnioyned and disseuered)
and he always in me, speaking by me: and by me declaryng with miracles, his
power. Neither do I speak any thing of my self, which same thing he
speaks not by me: neither do I any thing of my self, which he by me
ioyntelye, does not work: how therefore do thou separate them that be
inseparable? and with several sight desireste to see them severally? beleueste
thou that the one being known, the other can be unknown? does the rest of
you also yet not believe yt al things cummeth of my father which are spoken and
done by me? and that there is no separacion betwixt us two? It had behooved you
to have credited me, so often teaching this thing: and if ye mistrusted my
words, yet truly the divine works and deeds surmounting man's power,
ought to have caused you to believe, that what thing soever proceeds from me,
is of my father: if my father himself should speak unto you, he would speak
none other thing than I do: or if he would work by himself, he would work
none other thing than I do work: we have one mind, one will, one power and
nature.

Therefore believe this, retain this, have this surely fixte in your hertes:
which thing if you do in deed, the withdrawyng of the syghte of this body,
shall be no harm unto you: ye shall better see me being absente with the iyes
of faith: and the same thing which ye now see my father do by me, which
do fast cleave unto him all manner of ways, shall I do by you, if you will
cleave to me by faith and charity: Yea and I shall also more evidently extend
forth the mighty power of my godheade, after that I shall remove away from
you this my manhead: yea and moreover, whosoever ever does join himself to me
by true christen faith (like as I am naturally alwaie joined, and never
disseuered from the company of my father) the same person shall also do
greater things, than I do, so often as the glory of God requires a miracle.
For as my father works now by me, so shall I work by you.

And because it is so expediente for the salvation of man that I do go
again to my father, ye shall succeed me, and by course enter into my room
concerning the ministracion of the gospel. Nor this thing shall only be
done, but what thing soever else ye shall ask of my father in my name,
whatsoever ye ask in my name:
which shall appertain unto the praise and glory of my fathers name and mine,
that same shall I do: to the end that by you also, I may be glorified among
men, as my father has been hitherto glorified by his soonne. Let not my
departure therefore trouble you, which shall turn to your great commodity
and prefermente. Than most of all shall I be your aid in all affairs and
purposes, which make for true health, when as I shall take away from you this
sielye body. Only ask the thing that you couete, my father shall hear your
desires, and I being a continual present advocate unto him, will bring to
pass that what soever ye shall ask, shall be obtained: for as he denies me
nothing, which do no manner of thing that redoundeth not to his glory: so
will I deny you nothing, so long as ye do that which shall set forth the
honor of my name: Forsooth my spirit shall put into your minds what you
ought to ask. Thus to be grieved with my going hence, is no proof of christen
charity, for so men are dismayed when a friend remoueth whom they shall soon
after forget. If ye love me truly, as I do love my father, declare your
charity toward me in very deed: ye shall soothly and certainelye declare it,
if ye do keep my commandments. So shall it come to pass, that as my
father loves me and denies me nothing: In like wise shall he also love you,
obeying my precepts, which be the very commandments of my father. Thus it
is needful for the salvation of the world, that I do absente my self from
you.

And yet going away I will not leave you desolate, and altogether without
coumforte. But rather if ye abide firmly in my love, and keep my
commandments, I shall obtain of my father by prayer after my return again
unto him, that he which denies me nothing, shall send you an other
coumforter: which after he be once sent, shall not go away from you, as I
now do, concerning this manner of corporal presence. I am pulled away from
you, but he shall continue with you for ever. He shall be the spirit of me,
and my father, which shall make you of carnal folk spiritual: and he shall
turn this worldelye affeccion which ye now bear toward me, into an
heavenly love: he shall also with secret inspiracions, put in you the
treweth of all things, which ye now understand as it were but by a dream
and through a cloud. This special pledge of me shall be peculiar and propre
unto you. For I have all this while exhibit my self generallye and in common
to eiuill and good: lest any might make excuse that he was not invited to
salvation. But this world which coueteth much, and gapeth for goods that
be of the world, and deceitful, cannot receive that spirit, because he is
heavenly and true. And why can it not? because it has gross iyes, which
deliteth and loves not but gross and earthlye things, it seethe not him nor
knows him: for he without noise being all whisshed and still, tastes in
himself to the secret senses of the mind, if he find any where a
conueniente place to rest in. But truly you, in case that the delusions and
deceytfull things of this world being despised, ye will follow things that
be good in deed, and live well: you (I say) shall then know him, because he
will not only come unto you, as I am come, one that may be seen, but he shall
also abide continually with you: nor he shall not in such sort be
conuersaunte among you as the advocate is with his client, but he shall
inhabyte himself in the secret inner parts of your souls, and shall toyne
himself as it were giued to your spirit, that he may become one spirit in
all folks: and because he shall be as it were bred and planted in your hertes,
he shall accumpany and assist you in all things, and the mean time shall not
be long ere this coumforter that shall be in the stead of me, and my
vicegerante, shall come unto you. Wherefore there is no cause why your hertes
should be discoumforted or afeard, good children, whom I have perfeitly
begotten, and sumwhat framed with the heavenly doctrine of gods word, and do
nourishe you being as yet but imperfect, and not fully taught until ye grow
unto the strength of the gospel.

Although I go hence for a time, and shall no longer live a man with men, yet
will I not leave you in the meanetyme fatherless, and without confortable
succoure at my hand: For I will cumine to you again, before I return to my
father: and I will show my self before your iyes, and be seen of you with a
very body in deed, but than not mortal, to the entente that I may advance
and bring you from love of the flesh, to the spirit: for it were no great
matter if I should give this my body to you always to look thereupon, because
even the wicked do also behold it to their damnacion: within a while
therefore I shall be out of the worlds syghte: for death and the grave shall take
me away from the sight of worldly folks. Nevertheless I will see you again,
and present my self unto you alive, for this kind of death shall not
alienate us in sundre, nor keep me out of your syghte, for I shall live
again, yea after that I be dead: and I shall not only live, but there
withal bring to you life everlasting: and notwithstanding the time of mine
absence, I being alive shall find you alive, and I will so spend my life for
you, that you shall be in health and safegarde. Then shall you understand more
fully, that as nothing can pull my father from me, nor me from my father: so am
I both to you and you again to me, joined by mutual charity together, that
death can not disioyne us: let your only care be, that by your own fault ye
be not uncoupled and let lewse. The obseruyng of my commandments shall try
true charytie: nor he loves not in heart, that neglects the precepts of his
Lord. It is not sufficient to have accepted my commandments, unless a man retain them in mind. Nor it is not inoughe to remember them, except
they be kept: he that does accomplish and keep these, is he that truly
loves me. For to be tormented in mind for my departure, is no proof of
veraye true love. I that truly do love my father: do keep all his
commandments, and will keep them unto death of the cross. And there is no
cause why my commandments of sufferyng iniurye pacientelye, of beatyng the
cross quietely, should much put you in fear, as severe and grievous
commandments: and why? for charity shall sweten and make them all easy,
and there shall not lack coumforte at my hand, for surely whosoever loves me, he
shall be both loved of my father, and I also will love him, and never leave him
succourlesse, but will see him again, and will openly show my self unto him
to be looked upon: to make it more certain that I do not utterly perish by
suffryng death of the cross. Now I give my self to be seen of all folk,
but than no man shall see me, except he abide constantly in frendeshyppe. Of
truth our Lord Jesus spoke these things sumwhat darkelye, not only
signifiyng that he being revived again would often after his death come among
his friends to be seen, but that he would also by the holy ghost his spirit,
secretly place and wind himself into their minds, and that finally he
would come in the glory of his father, in the open sight of all folk.

Now than where as Judas, not he verily that is called Iscarioth which was
absente at this sermon, but the other Judas whose surname was Lebbeus, did not
fully understand our lords saying: but being through sorrow and fear very
sore troubled, did suppose that our Lord should in such wise appear to his
friends, as terrible spirits and fantastical sightes, show themselfes many
times in the darkness of the night: or as certain visions appear in dreams
rather to the fear of men, then to men's coumforte. This Judas therefore,
says: Lord what has chanced that when now thou majesty be seen of all
folk, thou shalt not than appear to the world, but only to us?

And how canste thou be one that may? be seen of us, if thou be such one as
other cannot see? But Jesus because he knew that his disciples were not yet
able to understand the mystery how that the same body, which had been
dead and buiried, but now made spiritual, and hable to do as it list,
should rise again: Jesus I say, knowing this, did not plainly answer to
the thing that was asked, but turned his saying to that thing which was more
necessary to be imprinted in their hearts, whereby they should now be
prepared spirituallye to have his presence: for as much as that presence
which should be exibited unto them after his resurreccion, could not long
endure with them. Therefore Jesus said: I will not present my self to the
world, because it loves me not, neither does it keep my commandments. If
one love me truly, he will not testify his love with sorrow, but by keeping my
commandments, and him will I love semblablye: and whom I shall love, him
will my father love, and we shall never be pulled away from him: nor I will
not only see him again that has my commandments in remembrance, but
there withal my father and I will by the spirit, which is common to us both,
come unto him: and we will not only come, forthwith to depart again, but we
will dwell with him, and never go away from him. That which is done after the
spirit is both perpetual and effectual: bodilye ioynyng together must needs
have an end, even for because ye should set at naught transitorye things,
and inure your selfs to love eternal things: and where ye as yet cannot come
to us, we will come to you invisible, but effectually to dwell in the temple of
your hertes. We be three in deed, but so joined and convert together, that he
which loves one, must love all: and he that has one of us lacks none of
us. Only on your behalf let charity be present, and that couenaunte kept,
which I made with you of late. That shall so couple you and us together, that
neither life nor death can uncouple us. If members may be disseuered from
the head, we may be disseuered. There be many which boaste themselfes to
love God the father, and seem to observe the commandments of the law, but
none does truly love God, if he hat^ and contemn his soonne: and he
verelye contemns the soonne, whosoever keeps not my commandment,
whosoever neglects my precepts, he neglects withal the precepts of God:
for in good sooth the thing that I have taught you, is not so my peculiar
doctrine that the same is not my fathers: but is rather my fathers than mine,
from whom cummeth whatsoever I can or do teach, doing nothing but by his
authority from whom I was sent into the world, to teach these matters
which I do teach. But now these things have I spoken according to your
capacity, as yet a mortal manne, being conuersaunte among mortal men:
soon hereafter I will repair to see you again, for certain days space: and
being immortal, will keep cumpany with men mortal, to the entente I may
coumforte, teach, and give you my counsel.

Neither is it unawares to me, that ye shall not fully understand these
things, which I now speak, and shall speak anon after my death, because
ye be yet still carnal and rude: notwithstanding they are not spoken all in
vain, for after that I shall take away this body from you: an other comforter
shall come to you, if ye ask him (of God) in my name: a comforter (I say) not
bodily as ye seem to to be, but that holy spirit which does sanctify spirits
and minds, whom my father shall send you in my room if you require him in
my name. Ye shall not after this need my corporal presence, which for a
season was given in consideracion of men's grossenes, to the entente that the^
might by degrees and orderlye go forward to more perfeite things, for that
spirit in as much as he is mine and my fathers, shall put you in
remembrance of all the things, which I now speak unto you that be as yet
ignoraunte, and of small capacity: and besides that obliuious. And he also
shall make you understand these things which ye had not understand
before, neither will he suffer you to forget any thing or to lack knoweledge
of any thing that pertains to salvation. Of men obliuious he shall make
you of good remembrance, of slow witted, easy to be taught, of sleapishe
slu^gardes, vigilante and watchefull, of sorrowful men cherefull, of yearthly
fol^^ heavenly. Only persevere you in charity, having in remembrance my
commandments.

There is no cause why that ye should in the mean while fear the
troublesumnesse of this world, which ye shall see rise against me, and in
time to come against you also: let it suffice you that at my departure, I
shall leave peace unto you, and give you my peace. No worldelye storm can
destroy and undo him that has my peace. Peace I leave v^t^ you
The world also has his kind of peace which it bestows upon them whom it
loves, but this is a peace not to be trusted on. My peace which I do give
you, does make frendeshyppe between God and you: and who can hurt him which
has God his protector and governor? The peace which* I do leave unto you
ioynyng you together among your selfs by mutual concord, shall make your
fellowship strong and invincible, against all that the world or Satan, prince
of the world, can do. What means it than that my going hence which shall
be very commodious unto you, does so much fear you? Let not your hertes
therefore be troubled nor strieken in fear, ye have heard me say already,
and (that ye should the more credit me) I eftsoon tell you that of truth I
go hence for a time: but I will anon return again unto you. And in the
mean time I will bring to effect that I shall find you at my return safe
and in health. This blusterous storm of cruel persecucion shall for this one
time be executed upon me only. And soon after I am come again to my father,
I will be present with you again through the spirit that is the comforter.
And by him my father shall also be with you, and we shall never be separate
from you, until you be fully placed with us in the kingdom of heaven. Ye are
sorrowful because I go my way, but and if ye did rightly love me, forsooth ye
would rejoice, both for your own sake and mine: for I will not play the
runagate and gooe every where, but I will return again to my father to
obtain for you more excellent gifts at his hand, for because my father is
greatter then I am: and from him it cum^eth, what thing soever I do depart
with you. If ye stand in dread of any harm toward me, and are sorowefull
for my cause, it were more semyng ye should be joyful on my behalf, that am
removed and taken a way from these evils of the world, and go to my fathers
coumpany: and if ye be sorry for your selfs, my departure shall bring to you
much profit.

I know that I speak this to them that neither greatly take heed, nor
understand the same, but I do therefore repete, and often inculcate and bring
in the same, that after the deed shall effectuously verify ye thing that I have
spoken, ye may than therewith believe all the rest to be true, which I have
told aforehande should follow: The prince of this world cummeth and has
nothing in me.
after this I being a mortal man shall not speak many things with the^ that
he mortal: for the time is at hand when I shall be taken away from you in body.
Uerye Satan the prince of this world is present by his minysters ready to set
upon me, with his full might and force utterly to cast away and to
extinguishe me. But at his hand is no ieopardie, for he has no right nor
authority over me, and when he most ^eu^teth to have the ouerhande and
victory, than shall he be vanquished and overthrown: he has no right but
upon them which be in sin, and because the world is in bondage to sin,
he may play the tyraunte over them that make the world their God: for in
deed I am neither forced to dye, nor for any fault do I dye, but I suffer,
through my death to redeem those that be joined to me by faith, as members
to the body, from the tyranny of sin and death: and my father has
commanded me thus to do, which his commandment I do according to his
mind: wherefore we have now already sit here long enough. Because I do my
fathers commandment willingly, it is time to go mete death, which is at
hand. Arise therefore and go we hence. Our Lord Jesus seeing his disciples
many ways dismayed, Arise let us go hence.
partly with sorrow because that they saw that their Lords death was nigh,
whom they loved somewhat worldly, but yet most vehementelye: partelye for
fear of harms which they thought did hang over him being once abroad: and
he also seeing them heavy of sleep which both the night provoked, and also
sorrow of mind augmented, and their sittyng made them of more sluggishe
mind: he commands them to rise, that so at the least, dullness being
avoided, they might be made more pregnaunte and quick witted to those
things which he should say unto them, and therewithal he monished the^ a
far of, and darkely, that now is the time to eleuate their minds from
yearthly affeccions to heavenly things, from bodily things to spiritual
things, from mortal things to immortal, from things transitorye to
eternal things, he would ha^^ that also imprinted in their minds, that he
knew before, and was willing to suffer what thing soever he should suffer,
his father also willing the same: from whose will his did never varye. His will
was that his Apostles so farr^ as man's weakness could bear, should be
witnesses and seers of his passion, and therefore in this sermon he makes
oftentimes mention of his departure, little by little, thereby to inure them to
sufferaunce, but mixyng withal many coumfortes to mitigate the bitter pain of
sorrow, saying that in very deed he must depart: but so that within a while
he should come to them again: that he should go to his father, that thence he
should send him an other coumforter which should finishe that he had
begoonne, and also that he and his father jointly together, should come and
dwell with them. He said furthermore that this persecucion should not
utterly devour and consume them: and after all this he had them thence to an
other place, because the place where they we^ than, was open and in sight: and
for because that they had heard that the prince of the world was even than
present, they stood in a general fear of themself, and therefore he brought
them to an other place whereas they were more in safety, to thyntente they might
with more bold hertes give ear to other things.

In conclusion he tells them aforehande, that at the length they should
follow him thither, whether he now goes before them: well now he has
recourse again to that saying which algates must sit inwardely and a bide
in their hearts: in which saying he counsaileth them to persevere in charity,
and obseruyng his commandments, lest through their own fault, they
should disseuer theymselfes from the fellowship of the father, the son and
the holy ghost, from which Judas had already forceably dissociate himself.
But he advises them to stick to their couenaunte by obeying the sayings of
their Lord, and to thuttermoste of their power to follow his doings.

And truth it is that this could not be do^n, unless they did persevere in
the spiritual fellowship of the soonne, and yet in the mean time not to
trust to theimselfes, or any thing at all to presume upon their own propre
strength, for they should never be able to do ought at any time, but by
the benefit and free gift of Godde, from whom flows and issues out to
all folk, what thing soever sets forward true health, and makes to
salvation, and that they might the better understand this, and retain it in
memory, he declares the matter by a similitude, taken and brought in of a
plain known thing, that is the vine and the branches thereof.

The.xv. Chapter:

TO the intent, says he, that ye may utterly understand how clean void of
all peril ye be, if ye will continue still to be of my fellowship, and what
great danger it is for you, if ye falling from the couenaunte that I have made
with you, be disseuered from me: remember this that I am the true vine, ye be
the branches, and my father is the housbandman. I am the root or stock of
the vine, ye are my members as branches sprung out of the stock. My father
has planted me, that is to say, he has begotten me. The stock came forth
from him, and ye out of the stock. The thank of the whole benefit redoundeth
to my father, as the fountain thereof, which does give unto you by me, and his
spirit, whatsoever he gives you. And the sap of the stock which gives
unto the branches both life and strength to bring forth fruit, is the spirit
that is common both to my father and to me. Like as the spirit knitteth me to
my father, so does it also join you to me. Therefore what branch soever
cleaves to me, and living by my spirit, brings forth fruit worthy for the
stock, the same shall my father purge, cuttyng away the superfluous desires
thereof, that it may bring forth more plenteous and kindly fruit. But whosoever
cleaves to me by ye profession of faith, and bringgeth forth no fruit of
evangelical charity, my father shall cut him of from the vine, as a
cumberous and unprofitable membre. For that branch which has no fruit, but
only leaves, serves to no purpose in the vine.

Now already ye be branches somewhat purged and made clean through beleuyng
my word: but yet ye must hereafter be more purged, that ye may bring forth
more plentye of fruit. At this time it is enough for you to be grafted in the
stock, from whence through faith ye may receive life: labor dilygently to
abide in me, and I will in like manner dwell in you, so long as you depend
upon me. For as the branch if it be pulled of from his vine, cannot it self
bring forth the fruit, because it takes all his sap of the stock: no more
can ye bring forth the fruit of any good work, except ye cleave to me by
faith and charity: from whence must come to you whatsoever furthereth to
true and eternal salvation. Wherefore neither Moses nor any of the Prophets
is the vine, but I am the only vine, to the which all they must cleave that
will bring forth the fruit of salvation. Ye be the branches of this vine,
wherein ye are freely graffed, freely pourged, but ye may fall from thence
through your own fault. Wherefore ye must earnestely take heed that ye may
be always joined to me. For whosoever continues still joined to me, having me
likewise joined to him, and living by my spirit, that person through my
fathers inspiracion, brings forth fruit plenteously, gayning for himself
eternal salvation, and causing God, for whose sake al things be dooen, to
be glorified among men. And his glory is my glory: by whom it has
pleased him liberally to give all that he gives men, to the atteinyng of
eternal salvation. Therefore remember this well, that without me ye can do
nothing that good is. But if any branch do through his own fault pull
himself back again from me, he not only brings forth no fruit at all,
but like as an unprofitable branch, when it is cut of with a shreadyng hook,
withers, and afterward being gathered up with other twigges that be shred
of, is cast into the fire to burn: so the same branch destitute of my
moisture and spirit, dies spirituallye although he live bodilye. And being
after this life separate without recovery from the vine, is cast into
everlasting fire, there to burn for ever to his great tormente: If ye bide in
me etc, ask what ye ^yl and it shall be given you.
for somuche as he would not abide still in the vine, and so bring forth
fruit of eternal felicity. And ye shall abide in me, if my word abide in
you, if ye keep in mind the things which ye believe, and execute in deed that
which ye remember. If ye will do this, ye need not fear any worldelye
storms, for though I be not still present with you in body, yet both my
father and I will hear you. And if ye do rightly ask all such things as ye
would have, ye shall obtain your asking. But like as of your selfs ye are not
able to bring forth fruit: even so ye ought not presumptuously to attribute
to your selfs the praise of your good deeds, for as I have not sought mine
own glory but my fathers, of whom I have all my being and power: so shall ye
refer all the thank and commendacion of your good deeds to my father and
me. When men shall perceive you to bring forth much euangelical fruit,
then is my father glorified among them: for what praise soever I shall get
by you, the same shall redounde to my fathers glory: whom ye shall cause to be
praised among men, by showing your selfs the right disciples of his son,
not that we need worldely praise, but because so it is expedient for the
salvation of mankind, which thing we do thriste for and couete. It cummeth of
charity and not of ambicion that my father thus desires to be glorified
among men.

I have loved you which are my branches, even as my father has loved me,
that am the stock. Be careful to keep this so great a benefit freelye given
you, lest ye lease it through your negligence, and ye shall not lease it: Like
as I always procuring my fathers glory, have continewed even to the death in
my love toward him: so will ye persevere in your love toward me.

Wherein ye shall persevere not by the observing of the Phariseis or philosophers
precepts, but by keeping of my commandments: so that neither any flattery or
fear of the world may separate you from the^, no more then it does me, which
do constantly to the death, keep my fathers commandments, being never
disseuered from the love of him, but by very deeds declaring my self to
requite his love with like love. Wherefore as it shall be my fathers glory, to
have so natural a son, and so worthy for him, no less shall it be for both
our honors that I may have you my disciples obseruers of my words, and
folowers of my doings. Albeit these things be sumwhat painful and tedious,
yet do I therefore use so long co^municacion therein, to the intent that as I have
not labored for the joy of this world, but herein do rejoice that for obeying
my fathers commandment I am beloved of him, no more should you seek comfort
of the world, but rejoice in this my kind of joy, whenever ye following my
steps shall be afflicted: and let that joy remain in you ever increasyng
into greater, and better, until it cum perfitly to the perpetual felicity of
immortal life. One of you charitably to love an other, shall be a great cumforte
to you, even in the myddest of all your troubles, when ye be at the wurste.

There be diverse precepts of the Phariseis, and Moses has also many, but
this one precept is my very own which includes all things that I do teach,
and shall make pleasant all adversities which shall happen, that is to say,
that ye bear such love one to an other, as I have borne toward you. I do
testify my love not with words only, Continue (...) in my love. etc.
but also with deeds: and that love not to be after the commune sort, but
excellent: and the greatest that any man living can have, for there can be no
greater token of love among men, than a man to bestow his life for his
friends sake, for every man sets by his life above all things. Many
perchance might be found that could be content to bestow money or labor
for an other man's sake, but the person is rare to be found out, which will
bestow his life for his friends sake. I do more then all this, which bestow
my life for mine enemies, so they will becum my friends. And in the mean while
I call them my friends in the way of honor, whom I have good right to call my
servants. Nevertheless I will not take you for my servants, but for my
friends: if ye will as cherefully and gladly perform these things that I
command you, as I do willingly obey my fathers commandment. They that are
under Moses law, be rightfully called servants: because they depend upon
diverse rules prescribed unto them, and rather for fear then for love do the
thing that is appointed them. But as for you (whom I have called from the
bondage of the law, unto the liberty of the gospel) from hence forth I will
no more call servants but friends, as them whom mutual love and not
necessity does join unto me. For the servant perceives not his Lords
intent, but only does that he is bydden, lokyng for no great reward if he
do it, and well assured to be punished if he do it not, besides that for
every sundry doing must be had a sundry commandment, as go, cum again,
do this* eschew that. For the master tells not his own counsel to his
servants, which are therefore evil to be trusted, because they rather fear
then love him. The cause wherefore I have called you my friends, is for that I
once have opened unto you all the purpose of my mind, to the intent there should
be no need hereafter of men's precepts contrary to mine. Whatsoever my father
has willed me to show you, thereof I have made you partakers, as my trust ye
friends. Those things which I have taught you, be out of all doubt: for I
have taught you none other, save what I have heard of my father. My precepts
be his precepts, by keeping whereof he shall count you his friends instead of
servants.

fruit, and your fruit shall remain, that whatsoever ye ask of the father
in my name, he may^ give it you. And because ye may the better understand how
great the honor of this my gentleness toward you is, consider how that ye have
neither provoked me with your service doing, to my friendship, that of duty I
ought to love you again: nor yet have you willyngly cum to my frendshippe, that
for ge^tlenes sake, I should requite you with like love: but when ye were in
bondage of the law, and far of from the favor of God, then did I of mine
own voluntarye will chose you from among all the rest, without your desert. And
for this purpose have I chosen you, that ye should more and more increase in
goodness, being grafted in me through mutual love, which ye could not have
toward me, except I had first loved you. As the branch is always norished
by the moisture of the vine, and spredeth it self in many branches, so must
you likewise plentifully bring forth fruit of the gospel throughout the
whole world, and so do good to other that your self loose no fruit thereby For
the common vine brings forth fruit, but for other, and that such as soon
decays: wherefore the branches thereof be fruitful but for a time, because
they grow in a vine that soon fades. Contrariwise you, because ye cleave to
an immortal stock, shall bring forth fruit that never shall perish, but
continue s^unde to your eternal salvation. And ye have no cause in the mean
while to say it is a great pain to travail about the world to teach the
Gentiles, to suffer the dispites of wicked people. What wages, what aid, what
reward is apoint^d for us? pass not upon these worldely defenses. Let this
stand you instead of all rewards and helps, that whatsoever ye shall rightly
ask my father in my name, he shall give it you. What thing is more easy then
to ask? And what is it that he is not able to give? Furthermore what is the
thing that he will not give for my sake?

Besides this, my commandments be not tedious, for what is more pleasant
then one to love an other? Who be so weak but mutual love may make them
strong? what thing is so grievous but mutual charity can make it delectable?
Neither let this trouble you, that whiles you and I be friends and one of you
charitablie do agree with an other, ye shall be at discord and strife with
the world, but rather the self same thing ought to cou^fort your minds, for
so much as by this token ye shall well perceive your selfs to be my very
disciples and friends, that is to say, contrary to the world, which is all
set upon malice: whereas you are appointed for heaven, disdain not to suffer
that in the world which I have suffered before you. The world hates me also
not for my deserte, but because I reprove and disclose the evil deeds thereof,
teaching things which do not agree with their worldly affeccions. The world
knows men of his sect, and them does it love and exalte, as like louethe
like: and as an evil itche coueteth an handsume scratcher. Therefore be they
unhappy whom this world flattereth and favors, for that declares them to
be far from the favor of God, which is that only thing that make the man
happy in deed. When the world hates you, remember mine exaumple and rejoice
in your own behalf that ye have no feloweshyp with the world, but do cleave
fast unto me. For this shall ye perceive by the hatred the world bears you,
how that ye be mine. In case ye were of the world, if ye loved wordly things,
and taught according to worldly desires, then the world would know you and
love you as his own, but because ye follow not the ways of the flesh, but of
the spirit, and couete not worldly goods but heavenly, therefore the world
hates you: not that ye deserve it, but for that ye be unlike to the same which
is evil and wicked. In times paste when ye thought perfitte righteousness to
consiste in the gross ceremonies of Moses law, and setting your minds on
transytorie things, had no love to heavenly things, the world did then well
like you: but after that I had once called you from this sect to the
evangelical and heavenly doctrine, and graffed you in me as branches in the
stock, the world began to hate you, and that only because ye be mine. Yet
of truth for no cause else shall ye be blessed, then for that ye be mine.
Marvel nothing at all though your innocence shall not defend you from the
hatred of the world. Remember how I have told you, the servants state is
no better then his lords. For neither could my innocence, which is greater
then yours, defend me from the malice of the world, neither were they afearde
to despise my doctrine, nor yet for all my benefits would they wax gentle,
and call themselfes back from their cruel purposes. That thing which they
durst enterprise against me, who am your Lord and Master, much more boldly
will they do it to you. Se^ing they have de^^sed so many snares to bring me
even to the most reprocheful death, and have so often spitefully railed upon
me, they will also persecute you my disciples, nay but rather me in you. If they
will obey my words they will also obey unto yours: but like as they have not
well borne my doctrine, no more will they yours, because ye shall teach the
self same things, that I teach.

And whatsoever despite they shall do against you, I will think it done to
me: for all things that they shall do against you, they shall do it for the
hatred they bear to me: when they curse you, they shall curse me: when they
reiecte you, they shall reiecte me: when they beat you, they shall beat me.
For whatsoever displeasure is done to the members, the same redoundeth to the
head. And they would do the like to me, if they had me present with them. Now
because they cannot show their cruelty to me, they will show it to you. But
as all the injury that is dooen to you touches me: In like manner whatsoever
is committed against my name, tourneth to my fathers dishonor also: whom if
they did rightlye know, as they think they do, they would never so
shamfully have handled his son. They arrogantlye pretend love toward God,
and yet they be wickedly minded against his son. They ask salvation of
God, and go about to destroy his son. They boaste themselves to be kepers
of Gods commandments, and do reiecte the precepts which his son gives
by the authority of his father. They glory in their knowledge of the law,
and do not receive the knowledge of him, whom the law sets forth. They
wurship the sender, and persecute him whom he has sent. Therefore they know
not God, whom they boaste themselfes to know. And yet this ignorance shall
not excuse them in the day of punishemente. They be ignoraunte in deed, but
why? because they would not learn. And therefore would they not learn,
because they loved more their own glory, then the glory of god. They did set
more by their own advantage, then to win salvation by the gospel.
Wherefore that thing which my father has ordained for their salvation, have
they through their own stubber^esse, heaped up to their eternal damnacion.
For verily I am come and was sent for this purpose, if it might be, to save
all men. If I the son of God, and greatest person that could be sent, had
not come my self, and declared unto them all such things as might have
brought them to a better mind: If I had not also done these things which had
been enough to have forced even stouye hertes to faith and belefe, surely
their destruction should have been the more easy, as giltlesse of this
infidelity, the addicion whereof, shall make the burden of their eternal
damnacion the heauyer. But now since I have leafte nothing undone whereby they
might be saved, and they again with obstinate malice have resisted him which
freely offers salvation, they can allege no excuse for their incredulity. If
one hate a stranger, it may be thought sumwhat worthy of pardon because he
hates him whom he never saw, but me they have both seen and heard. They
have seen me do good to all folks, and have heard me speak things worthy
for God, Nevertheless they hate me for those things, for which they ought to
love me. But whosoever hates me, must needs hate my father, by whose authority I
speak that I speak, by whose power I do all that I do. And I have not only
spoken by words, but also by my deeds: yet were they so blinded, that they did
neither believe my words not deeds. And this self thing shall make their
damnacion more greuouse, in that they have so stubbernely abused the goodness
of God, being always so ready for them. But now have they nothing to cloak
their sin withal.
If I had not done such miracles among them as never any of the Prophets
before me did, whether a man consider the noumber or greatness of them, and
that not to make them afeard or astonished therewith, but to help them that
were afflicted, If I had not done all this, I say, they should not have been
guilty of this most greuouse sin: but now they have both heard and seen,
and so much the more have hated not only me that have both spoken and done,
but also my father which has spoken by me, and set forth his power by me.
They never saw Moses and yet him they do exteme hylye, they believe the
Prophets whom they never heard, but they turn clean away from me whom they
have presentely seen before their iyes, whom they have heard speak, of whose
benefits they have so many ways had the proof. And not herewith satisfied,
they take my life from me. In the mean while they pretend a reuerente love to
God the father, whereas whosoever truly loves the father cannot hate his son.
Howbeit these things happen not by chance, for the very same thing that these
men do, the Psalms which they have and read, did long agon prophecy should
cum to pass, that is to say, that instead of thanks, they should
recompense good turns with evil will. For thus spoke I there, by the mouth
of the Prophet: let them not rejoice and triumph over me, which unjustly
are mine enemies and hate me without cause. If a man being provoked, hate an
other, it may be suffered: if one hate a stranger, it may sumwhat be
pardoned: but who can forgive him that hates one whom he both knows and
has found beneficial?

Nevertheless the incredulity of these persons shall not make their fruit
ineffectual which will clean to me. For when I shall have accomplished all that my father has given me in commandment, and after that the comforter is
come, whom proceeding from my father, I will send you according to my promise,
which is the holy ghost (being the inspirer and teacher of all truth) he
shall declare all that ever I have said and done, whereby both my goodness and
their obstinate blindness shall evidently appear. He shall show how there
has been nothing done against me, but the same has been prophesied before in
their own books which they read and yet understand not. Ye also which are
now but weak, then being made strong through the inspiracion of my spirit,
shall testify of me before all men, for so much as ye have seen in order
what I have done, and heard what I have said: Like as I have told you
things certain, even the very which I have seen and heard of my father,
neither shall the holy ghost put any thing but truth in your minds, for so
much as he proceeds from my father: so shall ye bear witness of things not
doubtefull, but such as be thoroughly tried by all your senses. And there will
be sum which will not believe you, but yet must not the salvation of other be
lost, because of them which wilfully perish through their own fault.

The.xvj. Chapter.

IT shall not be seming that every danger should withdraw folk from the open
confession of the gospels truth, which the world, of truth, shall spurn
against with all devices, but it shall never be able to put it to utter
silence and convince that truth, which staieth it self upon God the auctour
thereof. Ye see what things the woorlde goes about to do against me, for
publyshyng my fathers truth. And it is nedeful yt ye prepare your mi^des
patiently to suffer the like. I do therefore tell you yt these thin^ges shall
cum, lest ye suppose the profession of the gospel to be all plesau^t and
delicate, and than you to be ye sor^r dismayed when the same things chau^ceth
to you at unawares, and otherwise than you look for. For the eiuils which a man
foreseeth, against which he stiffly bends his mind ere they cu^ in place,
less grieueth. I will not deceive you, neither in the displeasures which
must needs be suffered for ye gospels sake, neither as touching ye rewards
which ta^ieth for them ye valiantly do their duty and office. To you that
begin to preach the gospel shall this thing first happen. They that are
thought to understand the high points of religion, and to keep the
perfeccion, and do teach and profess the knowledge of the law, shall cast
you out of their Synagogues as wicked and coursed people, a thing among them of
most reproach, and herewith will they not afterward be contented, but they
will cum to imprisonment and to strokes. And at length the thing will grow to
this end, yt whosoever kylleth you, shall think himself therein to offer a
tha^kefull sacrifice to God. They shall color out their wickedness with
pretense of godliness, and shall accuse and condemn as guilty of impiety,
the teachers of true godliness: and so it shall cum to pass, that not only
ye must suffer hard and greuouse things, but ye shall be punished as
ungodly persons and malefactors. But care ye not what the world judges of
you, let my exaumple comfort you, remembering that ye suffer these things with
me, and for my fathers sake and mine. The injury is ours, we have the wrong,
and it shall be our part, both to aid you in your conflicte, to reward you
having the victory, to resist them and also punish their obstinacy: think
ye nothing at all of vengeance, for they shall not thus handle you because ye
be thieves or transgressors, or any way else worthy such eiuill entreating,
but because they do not yet perfectly know neither me nor my father. The
ignorance wherewith their cruelty is mingled, shall cause my father to take
compassion upon them, nor I would not ye should so much desire their
punishmente, as to have them saved by doctrine: for the zeal of religion shall
set or provoke many against you, rather through error of judgment, than of
eiuill will. These folk shall repent themselfes and amend, after that my father
be known to the world by you, and as soon as men shall through your preaching
understand my doctrine, and know what is the power of the holy ghost. I know
ye be sorry for my departure hence, and sorrow is not to be added upon sorrow,
but I thought mete to forewarne you hereof, that when these discommodities
falls upon you, ye may the more patiently and with less hertebreake bear
them, calling to your remembrance how I had told you before, yt these things
should follow: and that after mine exaumple, ye should suffer of the wicked,
of such as be ignoraunte of the truth, and even for my fathers sake and mine:
but be ye suffised with a stayed conscience in the truth, and pass not what
men judge of you, or rather follow my doctrine, and judge your self blessed,
when for my names sake men do persecute you, when they speak all eiuil of
you, and ^elie you. They shall put you out of their Synagogues, but that self
thing shall prove your names to be registered in heaven.

I knew all these things should happen you. Nevertheless when I first
took you to me, I spoke nothing of them, not to deceive you thereby, but
because the time served not than, as in deed all things are not fyt for all
times. This my bodily presence has for a season nourished and strengthened your
weakness, but now forasmuch as the time of my departure from you is at
hand, it is nedeful yt ye be openly admonished what ye shall suffer, to the
intent ye may by little and little enure your selfs to be content to lack the
comfort of my corporal presence, and after ye have sequestered worldly
affeccion, to take unto you more fyrme and manlyke boldness of heart, and not
to be childishe end like unto babes that hang on their mothers lap, all
afraied, if it chance them at any time to be pulled away out of their parents
sight. I would not pamper and disceyue you with vain hope, nor yet an other
time discourage you: ye have been served according to your infirmity, and as
time required. I have been your comforter, It is expedient for you that I go
away.
advocate, and defender. Now I must depart hence, and though I do so, for your
cause chiefly to strengthen you in greater things, after this my body be
withdrawn out of your sight, yet my talk thereof does put you in such fear
that none does ask, or so much as think whither I go, where as in deed ye
ought rather to rejoice, than in mind to be troubled with my departure, seeing I
go to my father, from whom I came: not that I shall hereafter be utterly
absent from you, but in an other sort present with you. Nor I was not
ignorant what would have been more pleasant to your affeccions: ye had rather
have the continual ^^alcion of this my conversation among you, but I had
leauer speak to you of things that do profit, then: which does delight you,
and would leauer have you upon knowelage of the truth to be in heaviness for
a time, than not to proceed to the sure constancy yt should be fit for the
storm to cum. And for this cause I do open unto you what shall chance
hereafter. Uerily thus I must leave you, and after that I be taken away from
you, ye shall suffer many things: and that ye may be the more apt to bear
the same more patiently, it is expedient for you, that I be had out of your
^ight. For unless by taking from you the sight of the flesh, ye ware
spiritual, that comforter the spirit which shall make you strong, and not to
be vanquished, shall not cum unto you. And because I have prepared you for him,
he shall perform and finish that which I have begone in you. Finally through
that spirit I shall always continue with you, yea and that more presently
after I be gone, than I am now in this kind of presence. For the purpose of
my cumming was not to dwell still with you in the world, but the cause why I
did abase my self to your state and infir^^tie, For if I go not away the
co^forter will not cum unto you.
was to enhaunce you to heaven. It has so seemed good to my fathers wisdom as
process of time should serve, to advance you little by little, and by certain
degrees, to things of perfeccion: and it is but reason that ye on your
behalfes do accommodate your minds and good wills to my fathers order and
disposicio^ of things: ye shall have al thing of our gift, but your part is
to endeavor your self to be mete to receive our benefit, for if ye should
always continue thus affect as ye be now, that heavenly comforter will not cum to
you, as yet unable to receive his gifts. But if I go my way, and that you
not regarding this corporal presence, will frame your minds to hier gifts,
which that spirit shall give you, then shall my father send him unto you,
never to forsake you nor to leave you succourlesse, whether you live or dye. Nor
he shall be no frutelesse spirit, but when he cummeth he shall work more by
you, than I now do: not that but our power is all ^ne, but because to
appointe to every busynes his time, is a thing expedient for man's salvation.
I have reproved the world, the same thing shall he do more fully and more
plainly: for he shall sore charge the world, that except it do for think and
amend it self, geuyng faith to the gospel, it shall be without all excuse:
for in deed like as the infirmity of our flesh offends the world, even so
does it seem to minister matter why the said world may pretend an excuse of
his infidelity. They have seen this outward man very hungry and a thurst,
they have seen me poor, and had in contempt, within a while they shall se me
sore afflicted, taken of mine enemies, al to beat and curryed and in
conclusion die. But when all things be finished that the flesh has here to
do, and that they shall se this body after it be dead, live again, and ascend
up into heaven, and shall se the holy ghost sent, and make you so dainly
unfearful preachers of my name, and shall also perceive wonderful power,
virtue, and strength, showed by calling upon my name, as devils to go so dainly
out of men, the halte and lame to be restored to their lymmes, the sick to be
healed, the dead to live again, and moreover every thing to cu^ to pass
which the Prophets had prophesied should follow and be: than (I say) no
manner of excuse shall be left to the wicked and mis^reantes: for than the
world shall be adjudged and condemned of three points, and can not be excused:
first of sin, after of righteousness, and thirdly of Judgment: he shall
rebuke the world of the greatest and such a sin as does include in it all
other sins, (a sin inexcusable) and why? because seeing they perceived the
prophecies of Gods own Prophets take effect, many thousands profess my
name, they that believed in me (after they had received the holy ghost) speak
strange languages, much noted for their miracles, forsake the supersticion of
Moses law, embrace the holy gospel, deteste their forefathers Idolatry, and
yet wurshippe the father of heaven in true godliness of life, nothing
regarding worldly commodities, but have their minds wholye set upon
heavenly things: the world, (...) say, perceiving this, what excuse shall
it make for his lack of belefe: If there shall be no lack on my fathers
behalf that has sent me, nor of mine which was sent to have had all men
saved, and if the holy ghost shall omit nothing, whom both we shall send,
neither ye whom that heavenly spirit shall use as his instruments, what
rests but that al may understand how that they perish in the sin of
unbelief? And when they shall see the profane Gentiles to have the sins of
their old former life washed away, and themselves endued with innoce^cie,
through baptism and profession of my name, it shall be manifest that wittingly
and willingly they abide still in their filthiness, and add sin upon sin.

And the world also shall be reproved of falsely usurped righteousness, and of
righteousness etc.
for now they sum way pretend the keeping of the law, they sumwhat glory in
observing the ordinances of their progenitors, they pretend religion which
their forefathers gave them, the feasts, the sabbath days, the prayers, the
works of mercy, their ways of honoring God, and such other like which
has the pretense of righteousness: but after that they shall see the
wonderful power of that spirit, not to be given but to those that have
professed my name, and that it shall be their chance which were Idolatres to
have it without keeping of the law, what than shall they say thereby, which
challenge to themselfes righteousness by keeping of the law? All in vain do
they glory before men in a false righteousness, which have refused him by
whom only true righteousness cummeth. And all this to be true shall then be
more open to the world, when that spirit shall declare me not to be dead,
whom they had fastened to the cross, and had bur^ed, but that I did return
again to my father, (from whom I came,) to ly^^ with him: and than being
inuisyble and withdrawn out of men's sight, to do greater things by you being
inspired with my spirit, than I did being with you ly^yng in the world. Thus
it shall cum to pass, that through these things the unrighteousness of them
shall be rebuked, which have put their hope of righteousness other where than
in me: and the justice of God made more notable, which faithfully has
performed the thing which many years ago he promised to mankind by his
Apostles, and Prophets* and within a while the thing shall be put in v^e and
take effect, for I shall not long be conuersaunt among you in this visible
body, but shall dye and go to my father. And yet ye shall perceive me to be
one that lives, and has power, and that shall accomplish all that I have
promised.

Moreover the world also shall be rebuked and reproue^ of judgment, because
that (by seeing men every where through penance co^^erte from sin to
innocence of life, leave the gross ceremonies of Moses law, and ruin to
godliness of the gospel, Of iud^eme^t, because the prince of this world is
iudg^d already.
the nations of the whole world forsake their wurshipping of devils and
images, and fall to the true wurshipping of God the father, the son, and the
holy ghost) it shall manifestly appear the prince of the world (who has
heretofore by sin practiced (...)) to be already with his own weapons
vanquished, put out of the way, and judged as one that has procured my death,
by whom innocence, liberty of the gospel, and immortality is recovered,
employed, and given. Than shall it well appear to have been a triumph, which
seemed to be a thing of shame and reproach, and that to have been a victory
which was imputed and counted for an overthrow and an utter destruction: for
when devils shall each where be cast out of the temples* and shall cry out at
the sign of the cross, when they shall leave the bodies which they had of
long time possessed at naming of me, shall not that openly prove their prince
to be judged and condemned? Shall it not be apparante and a clear matter that
they also be woorthely judged and condemned which had lever follow him being
already vanquished and judged to eternal death, than me, whom as a
conqueror, and to all folk the very auctour of innocence and of life, God
shall carrye up and auaunce to the fellowship of his kingdom?

I could tell you many mo things, but the time serves not, nor your
weakness will not as yet bear them: and since I have not yet altogether goen
through with this mine ambassade, I do therefore reserve them to the cummyng of
the holy ghost: he being once come, shall find you more apt to receive a
more full knowledge, even when the business of my death, resurreccion, and
ascencion shall be dispatched and fynished. This spirit that I speak of shall
be no lying or worldely spirit, but my very spirit, that is to say, the
spirit of truth, he shall teach you all truth, which ye are not now able
to receive at full. He also shall speak unto you, but (that shall be) by
secret inspiracions. He shall not with moving the air touch your bodily
ears, but by a priuey secret virtue shall move the inward minds: neither
shall he speak things of vncertaintye, but in like manner as I have spoken
nothing which I have not heard of my father, so shall he inspire nothing into
your hertes, but that he heard of my father and me: and he shall out only
open unto you all truth of things paste, but also he shall foreshewe you
things to cumme ere they happen, so often as need shall require: for he is not
alone only almighty, but has withal knowleage of all things.

He shall by you make the glory of my name be known to all men, like as I by
my death and resurreccion shall make my fathers glory notable and famous: for
as what thing soever I do, redoundeth to my fathers praise and glory, of whom
I have my being, and of him have received all that I have: cum so shall it
grow to my honor and praise, whatsoever he shall work by you. He shall
mocion you to nothing contrary to those things, which I (receiving them of my
father,) have taught you. All things is common between us, all things proceed
from my father: but whosoever is his, is mine, nor any thing is my fathers or
mine, which is not common to the spirit. Therefore by the said spirit shall
I speak to you, as my father has spoken to you by me: he that believes me,
believes my father, and he that believes the spirit, believes us both.

Now than being corroborate and stablished with many things, be ye bold and
take good heart unto you against the storm that hangs over you, and in
adversity save your selves to the prosperity which shall follow: within a
while ye shall lack the sight of me, but ye shall be without it no long time:
for within a short space after, I shall be presented to your sight again,
that so ye may little by little be brought in ure to want the sight of this
body, which is not most commodiouse for you. For I return to my father, to
thentente that after I cease to be seen of you, I may endue you with greater
gifts.

But not withstanding all this, so great sorrow did possess the disciples
minds at that time, that they neither understood nor could keep in memory
things that were often repeted and reiterate: for whereas our lord Jesus did
declare in these words not very obscurely, yt by death and buryall he should
be absent out of his disciples sight, yet none otherwise but that within three
days after he would appear unto them again, even in the self same body, but
now immortal: and so after he had for a few days space confirmed and stayed
the minds of his disciples, to conuaye himself again into heaven. And to
thentent that having his bodily sight withdrawn from them which let them to
be spiritual, they might deserve that heavenly spirit, and after that to
look no more for their lords bodily presence, save only when at the last
day he shall once for all show himself to the whole world for to judge the
quick and the dead: all this, I say, notwithstanding, yet did not the
disciples perceive the thing that was spoken, but said mutteryng among
themselves: what means this saying: after a little while and ye shall not see
me, and again there shall be a little time that ye shall se me, for I go to the
father? How shall we se him that has himself away to go to his father* Or
what means this little while wherein he shall restrain us from seeing of him,
and again after a little while, when as he shall permit us to see him? This is
a dark saying and we understand not what he speaks.

Than Jesus perceiving that their minds was to ask him what he meant by his
saying, What is this that he says unto us after a while.
prevented their demand and question: to declare (as his custom was) that he
knew the most secret thoughts of me^: and again he says: this that I
said, (after a little while the sight of me shall be taken from you, and again
after a little while it shall be restored newly unto you, because it is not
expedient that I should always tarry among you in such sort as I now do, but
it is more for your profit yt I depart hence and go to my father,) does
trouble you. The thing that I have said is most true. The time is nyghe, when
as having this our familiar cumpanie disceuered and broken, ye shall with
wayling, sorrow, and weping, be in manner consumed, and werye of your lives, as
men destitute of all succoure. Contrary, the world shall joy, praunce and
triumph as a conqueror, but within a little time the course of things shall
be changed: for the worlds joy shall be turned into sorrow, and your sorrow
into joy and gladness. The cause is that as my death shall grieve and make you
pensife, but it shall make the Jews glad, so my resurreccion shall make you
ioyouse, and contrary it shall vex and trouble the Jews. Wherefore bear you
well and boldly this short sorrow, through hope of the joy that shall follow
soon after.

In like manner as a woman great with child suffers sore gre^ous pains in
the time of her travail, but yet she bears out those painful throws with
a stout good heart, because she knows they shall not long endure, and soon
after there follows upon the birth of the child, joyous pleasure: for as soon as she has brought forth the child that she labored of in travail, her
pleasure in being a mother of a new child is so great, that she forgets
the dolourouse pain which she sustained in her travails: yea to say sothe,
she ioyeth much that she has boughte long comfort with a short dolor. In
the same wise shall you also for a little time that draws fast on, be sore
vexed in mind, yea and ye be now already in great sorrow, yet so that within
a few days hereafter when I being a conqueror of death, shall present my
self alyne again unto you, your hertes shall be replenished with great joy,
because him, whom ye did bewail and mourn for being dead, ye shall than se
alive and made immortal, never after to dye. The sorrowful mourning shall be
short, but the ioyeful mirth shall be perpetual: for death ouerpasseth, but
immortality remains for ever.

There be now many things which your heart lepeth for desire to question
with me of. Than shall your minds and also your iyes be so fully content and
satisfied, that ye shall wene no mo questions are to be demanded: for great
excelling joy shall shake of and utterly put away all grief of mind,
neither shall you wyshe or require any thing else, considering ye shall se and
perceive more given you than you looked for, or durst be bold to desire. I
assure you, after I be taken from you up into heaven, ye shall want nothing,
for what can be more easy than to ask of a father? whatsoever verily ye
shall ask of him in my name, Whatsoever ye shall ask my father in my name, he
shall give it you.
it shall be given you. What need you any other aid? The father alone may do
all things, and he will deny my friends and them that ask in my name,
nothing: hitherto my bodily presence has let you to ask any thing in my
name worthy the same: for as yet ye do not wholly depend of heavenly aid, but
as being led by worldly affeccion ye do depend upon this body: hereafter
lifting up your hertes to heaven make your peticion where ye know me to be a
present advocate, and ye shall obtain whatsoever ye ask, that your joy,
which shall after this heuines where in you be now, come unto you by reason
that ye shall se me again, may than be full and perpetual, for than shall be
no change of sorrow and joy, by having or not having of me after the
infirmity of the body, but trusting to heavenly succor that is always ready
for you, having always the spirit a present coumforter and counceler, ye may
enjoy a continual gladness of conscience, thankyng and praysyng God both in
prosperity and also in adversity.

This now by the way have I sumwhat obscurely and prouerbially spoken unto
you, as yet not fully understanding what I do say, for it behooved so to give
place and bear with your infirmity, that you also may learn to co^descend
and agree to the imbecillitie, and weakness of other: but the time shall come
when having this mortal body removed hence, I shall common with you (than
being more stablished and stronger, and also sorrow set a side more attent) of
my father manifestly, without closing up the matter in parables, for now by
reason yt your mind is vnsteadie, weak, and careful, the thing which is
plainly and openly spoken, is to you as it were a parable. At length I shall
even by my spirit declare and open unto you, the very certainty of my fathers
will, for it becummeth not you to be ignorant of my fathers will: verily I
shall than speak unto you whishtlie and without words, but I shall speak
assured and manifest things, if so be ye ask them: yea and than also the
holy ghost shall incense you, what to ask, and how to ask in my name,
which in case ye so do, surely though it were a great matter, and a thing of
difficulty, yet shall the father for my sake not deny it you askyng it.

And I do not now speak this as if ye shall obtain your request by my
mediacion, in such sort as men do sumtime at a kings hand yt is but a man,
obtain their request at the desire and suite of sum one that is in favor
with the king, which peticion the king would not else have granted, but that
he was content to give it for his sake which did commend and set forward the
suitors supplicacion: but as for my father, although he loves to be asked of
by his son, by whom his will has been to grant all things to men, yet
that notwithstanding he will otherwise consent to your desires, not only for
the love that he bears toward his son, but which he has also toward
you: for he loves not his son so that he loves not you, but whomsoever the
son loves, those the father loves also. Therefore he loves you, not for
your works sake, but for that ye love me semblably, and believe that I am cum
out from him, for this is to love the father, even to love his sone: and to
believe the father is even to believe the son. He of truth does not believe
which denies the son to have cum from the father, and not to have said and
done all thing even by the fathers authority.

I was already with the father, before I came into the world, even for to carry
you up, taking unto me this mortal body yt ye se, but for your cause came I
into the world, even for to carry you up into heaven. Now than the things
being once do^n, which the father gave me in commandment, I do even for
your sake, leave the world as touching bodily presence, and return again unto
the father: and truly whatsoever is or shall be done here, it is and shall be
done to bring you to salvation.

The disciples being boldened with these sayings, begun sumwhat to stand
in their own conceit, and as though they had of their own strength been
able to abide and hear their lords death that was at hand, they answer on
this wise: look (say they) even now at this present do thou fulfill the
self thing which thou promised^t afterward to do: for now without any
darkness of parables, thou speakeste plainly out, what thou will do: neither
needs it to ask the any further question. For thou knoweste all things, and
with thy good words have delivered our hertes from sorrow, so that we need no
further communicacion: and why? we nothing doubt, but that through hope of
thy joy to come, we shall boldly and patiently suffer the thing that is
imminent and cumming toward us: and we do therefore finallye and verily believe
that thou art cum out from god, because thou see thoroughly the very botome
and secrecy of our hertes. And than the Lord Jesus, whose manner was every
where sharply to control, and restrain whatsoever humayne and worldely
arrogancy, ambicion, or self affiance, he perceived to arise in his discyples
hearts, yt they might plainly learn to distruste their own strength and
virtue, whereby they might do nothing, and wholly to depend upon the hand
of God the father: The Lord Jesus (I say) did thus abate and acoole that
arrogancy (which was such) that though they yet understood not what he
said, though they had no true belefe, and as yet were not meet for the
storms that were cummyng upon the^, for all that they took on hand the thing
that was to be asked of God by prayer. And he answers them after this sort:
What do I hear? the thing which I promise to give you hereafter when ye
shall be made strong, Now ye believe, etc,
and be stayed by my doctrine, and by the inspiracion of the holy ghost, ye now
proudely take on hand before due time: as if ye might do at least sumwhat by
the help and assistence of ma^s own power and virtue: when as rather the time
is full nyghe that ye shall declare how strengthelesse year of your selfs.
For ye shall not only be unable to go through the instante tempeste, but
leaving me alone in the hands of the sergeauntes and catchpolles, which shall
violently draw me to the death of the cross, ye shall run away each one a
^ere way, through fear so amassed, that ye shall not one bear cu^pany with
another to your succoure and comfort, whiles every one shall fear other,
lest by any others telling he might be bewrayed and come in danger, albeit
in deed I need not your aid and help: I shall of truth be forsaken of all my
friends: but yet shall I not be desolate, because the father shall never leave
me. Therefore I do speak these things unto you, that distrusting your own
strength, ye may rest and stay your self in me. The world shall make
great commocio^, and fiercely rise against you, as it does against me, but
be bold and shrynke not, reme^bryng that I have conquered the world: ye
shall take exaumple at me, and shall trust to be helped by me, ye shall also
have victory but through me, being of your own nature very weak: and yet
when time and occasion shall require, ye shall be through my spirit strong
and unvanquished.

The.xvii. Chapter.

AFter that Jesus had with this kind of talk partelye comforted his
disciples, and partly taught them and given them also instruccion against
the daungerouse storm that was imminence and cumming upon them than for so
much as he had by word of mouth advertised them how that man's own power
and strength is not to be trusted to but men must put their trust in
heavenly aid and succor, he now therefore would teach his, by very
practice, that in worldely affliccions, which percase might sodeinly fall
upon them, they should look to none other for succor, but unto the father of
heaven, upon whom ought all they wholly to depend, that be desyrouse to be
strong enough and able to bear persecucion. Therefore, lifting up his iyes to
heaven, to thentente he so might even by the very semblance and behavior of
body teach whither the mind should be directed, and whereupon fixed, he
spoke on this wise: father (said he) now the time is cum which I have always
longed for. Glorify thy son among men by death and resurreccion, that thy
son on his behalf may glorify the amongst all men, and so the one to be
known by the other. For so it is expediente for the salvation of all mankind,
that the world know the son by thee, and the father again by the son. And
for this cause has it pleased thee to give unto the son power over all
mankind universally: And for none other end haste thou given this power, but
that all folk should be saved. And being delivered from death, should attein
to everlasting life. For it has liked the, that what thing soever thou
grauntest and geuest to men, thou geuest and grau^test it by me: through whose
death thou geuest to all that will, eternal life. Furthermore, the very
original fountain of eternal life is, that (both the one and the other setting
forth each others honor and name) men by faith know us both: that is to say,
thee, which art the only true god, not only of the Jews but of all the people
of the whole world, from whom proceeds whatsoever is any where good, and to
know him also whom thou have sent into the world, for the salvation of
mankind, Jesus Christ, by whom thou geuest whatsoever it pleases thy goodness
to give to men: and this thou do that they should render thanks to us both,
to thee as to the chief author of al things, to me who at thy will and
pleasure, am about willingly and gladly to finishe up this business that I am
appointed to. For he cannot cum to salvation which honors the father, in
case he despise the son, nor yet he that has the son in reverence if so be
he conte^ne and neglecte the father: for as much as the praise and glory of
the one, is the praise and glory of the other.

I have hitherto renoumed thy name by miracles, and with my doctrine here in
the world, and have goen about and done thy commandment being forward and
ready to prosecute and accomplish that which remains to be done. I have not
sought mine own glory, but thine: yea I have abased and cast down my self
into extreme contempt, to thentente I might blase and honorably set forth thy
name among men. For thy glory is always whole, substanciall, and sound in it
self, without decay, nor thou haste no need of ma^s praise, but it stands
them on hand that thou be known unto them. And now my father, bring thou it
to pass, that on the other part, the world may semblably know and perceive
that I am fully and wholly received into that same glory which I had with the,
before the world was made. By reason of the frail mortality and brittlenes
of the body, men impute me to be very base, and exteme me very courselye, but
they hiely exteme the. Thy glory as of it self it has neither beginning nor
endyng* so can it neither increase nor decrease. Nor the infirmity of this
body that I have put upon me, does not impouerishe or lessen ^y glory,
which I have always had being evermore borne of the, but thou haste made the
world by me, to have folk that should know, that should have in
admiracion, and should love thy power, wisdom, and goodness: and now again
is the time that thy goodness must restore by me, that which has been
fourmed and made. It shall verelye be restored, if the world know how great
thy love is toward mankind, which to save, thou haste given thy only son
unto death: how great thy power is that has conqu^red the devil and
vanquished his tyranny: how great is thy wisdom that has with such
wonderful device, converted the world unto thee which was alienate from thee.
The thing is begun, and the foundation of this work is laid.

I have made thy name known unto them, whom (being through thy godly
inspiracion exempte and priuileged from the world) thou haste given and
committed unto me. They could not have been taken out and separate from the
world, they could not have been grafted in me, unless thy liberal fre
goodness, had inspired their mind. Thine they were, whom thou createdst,
thine they were whom thou haste appointed to this business, and given them to
me to be taught and infourmed.

Neither has thy bounteousnes nor my labor and diligence been bestowed upon
them in vain. They have b^leued my doctrine, wherein I have taught them thee,
and not only given ^^^dence unto it, but they have hitherto stand steadfastly
in faith, obeying my words. For it is well known and persuaded unto them,
that the Jews would not believe, that whatsoever I have taught, whatsoever I
have done, it has proceeded from the as the auctor: and has been done through
thy power and virtue.

For I have taught them none other thing than that I have learned of the, who
also have al my being and whatsoever I am, of there, and whatsoever is thine is
also mine. Therefore my word (which the Phariseis have contemned,) have they
received as cum from the, and believing the same have certainly known that I
proceeded from the, and of the am sent into this world. They have thus much
profited, that they be persuaded how that I am Messyas, which have been so
many hundredth years looked for: whom thou haste sent into the world, for
the salvation of all that faithfully believe. And now because I do leave them
as touching companiship of body, I do on my behalf again commend them to thy
goodness to be kept and preserved, that they decay not, but always profit
more and more and wax better. They know whom they ought to thank for their
salvation. They know of whom to be succored, and whom to lean to. They do
depend upon thee.

Therefore I pray for them whom being withdrawn out of the world, thou
would should be thine: and my prayer is that thy goodness would stablyshe
and make the thing perpetually their own, which thou haste begun in them. I do
not now pray for the world, which being blinded in evil desires, does
stubbernly oppugn and reclayme against my doctrine, having envy at their
own salvation, when it is freely offered them: I pray for them whom thou have
committed to my tuicion, because they be not of this world but thine, and
against the malice of the devil, they cannot be in sauetie but by thy
continual aid. I therefore, o father, commend them to thee, that it may
please thee to let them be always thine, like as I am perpetually thine for
ever.

And therefore are they mine, because they be thine: For between us are all
things common. For whatsoever is mine, the same is also thine: And whatsoever
is thine, the same is also mine. And like as thou art honored and glorified by
my doctrine among men, so am I glorified by the belief of these, which
stick unto me constauntly: when as the Phariseis and the scribes stand
obstinately in the denial thereof. For these shall after a sort succeed me in
office, and come into my room, and after that I be taken a way out of this
world, they shall make both thy name and mine to be of famous memory,
throughout all the world. I have played the preachers part, and dooen my
funccion and office therein, wherein these shall succeed me, and come to like
office.

And now am I not in the world, which I do forth with leave, and go out of
it, but yet these abide still in the world in my stead, to disperse abroad
throughout all nations of the world, that which they have learned of me. But
I (leauyng them behind me) come whole to thee. O holy father, keep and
preserve them in preaching of thy name, whom thou gave me to teach: and so
keep them that they may preach and teach those things, which thou haste
wylled me to preach, and which things I have taught obeying thy will in all
things. And this do, that as I never went from thy commandments, but in all
things have agreed and consented to thy will, so both the doctrine of these,
and also their life, do never dissent from mine. For so shall our name be
truly glorified by them, if as we agreyng within ourselves do both the one
and the other glorify each other: so even these never dissentyng from us, do
make our name famous all the world through. For whatsoever they have taught
and done* because it shall be perceived to have come from us, it shall therefore
redound and be referred to the praise and glory of our name. As long as I
lived in their company familiarly, as a man with men, I was diligente to keep
them as thine, and as men that thou haste put me in trust withal, eue^ with
bodily service, and doings also, and I have retained and continued the^
hitherto in league with us. So many as thou gave me, have I faythfullye
kept safe, and never one of this couente or fellowship has perished except
one: which (though he lived in my company) yet was he none of mine, but borne
to damnacion, which himself through his own fault willinglye called for,
and occasioned to fall upon him. For I omitted nothing that should have revoked
him, and have brought him to better mind. And this thing truly did not happen
by casualtie, but holy scripture did long time before show it should come to
pass, that a familiar and a companion of householde, should betraye to death
his own lord and Master. Notwithstanding, through thy godly devise and
divine providence, it is come to effect, and purpose, that also this man's
death and damnacion, shall be profitable and do good to the public health
and salvation of the whole world, since that by him is procured the thing,
without which salvation could not be had, and sith also an example is gotten
thereby, which ought to counsel and admonish every man to abide constantly,
and to perceyuer in the thing that he has once begun, and taken in hand:
lest he by his own folly turn to his own utter destruction and cause of his
own damnacion, that thing which (by the mere bounty, and free goodness of
God) was given him, to obtain thereby eternal health and salvation.

But now, like as these matters are dooen by thy eternal wisdom and
judgment, even according as thou would have it, so I now after I have
finished the things that thou commaundedst me, do leave the world and come to
thee. But I that shall go hence, do in the mean while speak these things
unto thee, not that I am any thing doubtful of thy will, but that I may by
this prayer comfort and stablishe my disciples: to the intent they may
understand how that thou will care and provide for them, after that they shall
want the presence and sight of my body, and that they may also put away
sorrowful pensiveness, for that they know how that I shall live again: and
so their joy to be soon renewed again, when they have seen me risen from
death to life: and in conclusion, after they have seen me taken up into
heaven, and they to have received that heavenly spirit, the holy ghost, one
that shall be both in stead of thee and me, they may conceive and receive no
temporal or imperfect joy, which may rise by the sight of my body, when it
is brought to them again: but to have a perpetual and a perfect joy which
our spirit shall always infuse in them, dwelling in their hearts: to the
intent that now they should depend of nothing else than of a good affiaunce
in us, and in the vprightnes of conscience. The world shall stire up sore
storms of grievous persecucion against them, because my doctrine agrees not
with the affeccions and carnal desires of this world. For men, of truth, be
desyrouse of, and gape for earthlye and transitory things, and I teach
heavenly things. This doctrine which I had of the, I have taught it them: and
these few have well liked it and enbraced the same, the world setting naught
by it. And because these love my doctrine, the world hates the^, as forsakers
of the world, and runnagates to us: and the world has none other ground
thus to do, but because they stick unto us, and renounce the world. This
world has his baits and enticementes that seem pleasant for a time: it has
also his dreadful things, and threatninges, wherewith it does discourage and
weaken even a right strong and bold heart. Herewith he mayntaineth and
defends his faccion, and fights against our religion. Therefore equity
would, and no less becummeth our bounteousnesse, that those which has
forsaken the world to come to us, and have commit and credit themselfes wholly
to us, and altogether depend upon us, we should care and provide for: to
thentent the world may know that they be in more safety which betaketh
themselfes to our succoure and mayntenau^ce, than those that leans to the
aid and help of the world. The simple, plain true heart, which they bear
toward us, and the trust that they have in us, deserves heavenly favor, and
the hatred which the world bears toward them for our sake, provoke out
benevolence and good will toward the^. For the world does not therefore hate
them, because they be thieves or murderers, rauishers, or deceyuers with false
bying and sellyng, but because they be clear and pure from the enormities of
this world: as ambicion, covetousness, malice, pharisaicall fraud, from
idolatry, from vnclenesse and other sins wherewith the world is every where
infect. Furthermore as the world hates me because I have obeyed thy will, so
does it also hate them, because they do mislyke and contemn the doctrine of
the Phariseis, and set naught by the folishe wisdom of the world: but in a
simple and true meaning faith, obey my laws and tradicions. And the world
does not only hate me but also my name, and is loathe to have me spoken of:
yea for my cause it hates them whosoever they be, that will neglecte man's
doctrine, and follow the plain pure doctrine of the gospel, even because it
does much disagre with the lusts and desires of them which withal affeccion
and pleasure do enbrace things of this world. I now that have diligently
done my duty and office, I des^e^ not that thou should take them. etc.
am separate from the fellowship of the world, for so it is mete to be: But I
would not as yet have them cumpanions with me, for the time is not yet that
they also should be taken clean out of the world, until they likewise have
with diligence executed the office that is commit unto them. This I only pray
for, that they lining in the world, be not polluted with the vices of the
world, and that they fall not away from us, and turn backewarde into the
faccions and unstable opinions of the world: For they being so many ways
assauted, cannot shun and exchue that, without thy help. They stycke to me,
they be my branches, and my members. Thus the matter stands, that as I am
diverse and not agreeable to the world because I stycke to the: even so these
also are unlike to the world, and misliked, because they clean and stycke to
me. As I have kept me safe and pure from the filthy pollucio^s of the world,
so keep thou these clean and impolluted from all contagious infeccions of the
world. That shall take effect, if by thy aid and help they persevere in the
truth. The wisdom of the world has much falsehood mixte withal: Moses
law is wrapped in shadows of things: but thy word which I have taught is
pure truth, it has no disceite, it is clear and easy without smoke and
shadows. This truth have I taught purely and sincerely, that there needs not
now so many interpretacions or translacions, so many Pharisaical ordinances,
or so many labored Philosophical sophemes and subtle sentences. Only my
doctrine is plain and easy to be understand of all folk, if so be that faith
be had: And than it shall be a sufficient doctrine to everlasting felicity.

Like as I being thy Apostle, and messenger, and sent from thee into the
world, have done thy business faithfully, and have not been corrupted with
contagiousnes of the world, but rather have drawn the world to my pureness,
even so do I send these into the world in my stead, to teach purely and
sincerely that which they have heard of me, not studying their own gain and
praise, but following thy will, to the intent that by their testimony, many
may be drawn to us, and be separate from the world, which is altogether
sinful. And because these may be pourged from sin, and so persevere pure in
preaching the truth of the gospel, I do offer my self a sacrifice to thee.
For he cannot purely preach my doctrine to the world, that is subject to
worldly affeccions.

Nor I do not only pray for these which are few in number, but for all that
shall, through my doctrine preached of these, renounce the world, and put their
whole affiaunce in me. For it shall so come to pass, that as I sticking to thy
words, am not pulled away from thee, and like as these, sticking to my
precepts shall not be pulled away from me, but as branches shall live in us,
and as our members shall be quickened and made lively with the spirit: even so
other (which shall stick to these men's words, which being received at my
hands they shall teach to the world) being graffed in me, may be joined to
thee by me, so that the whole body may clean jointly together, thou being the
root and I the stock, the spirit being distribute through out all the
members: and both these branches, and the other that shall be brought to the
faith by these, being dispersed through out the whole world far and near. I
can do nothing with^^t thee, these could do nothing without me: The same thing
that I received of thee, have I poured into them by the spirit which is
common to all, The glory which thou gave me I have given them.
that as thou extendest forth thy power and strength in me, and I inseparably
do clean unto the: even so both we may extend forth our power in these
cleaning unto us, and will not be disseuered, to the intent that ye world being
provoked with these men's uniform doctrine, miracles, and honest chaste manners,
may believe that I am come from thee: and that whatsoever I have done, may
redound to the glory of thy name: and that the world also may understand and
perceive our spirit to be in these persons, showing forth and bryngyng to
light his force and power, by miracles and other diverse proufes. For as I have
not challenged to my self the praise and glory which the miracles that I have
wroughte have gotten me amongst men, but I have translate, surrendered, and put
it over to thee (o father) whom I have confessed to be the auctor thereof: so
the glory which these shall prepare by their great acres for the time to
come, shall be altogether ours: because they shall do nothing in their own
name, but shall refer all things to the commendacion and glory of our name.
And so therefore the world shall perceive such a concord between them and me,
as is between thee and me. I will work in them by my spirit, as thou have set
abroche thy truth in me. And so it will come to pass, that they also, as
members of one body, cleaning to one head, and quickened with one spirit,
may by mutual concord stick together among themselves: that on all parties,
there may be a consummate and a very perfect concord in heaven and in earth.

The ^iscencion in opinions does take away the belief of doctrine. If they
agreyng one with another shall teach the same that I have taught, if life agree
with doctrine, doubtless the world shall perceive it is no worldly or humayne
doctrine but to be come from whom thou sendeste into the world. It shall also
understand that they be beloved of thee, obeying thy will, as I am beloved of
thee, one that no where declineth or swarueth from thy mind and purpose.

Father my desire is, that as these whom being disseuered from the world thou
haste given to me, shall be folowers of mine affliccions and cross, so they
may be partakers with me of glory: that like as they have been beholders of
my base and mean state, and witnesses of my pain and torments: so they may
likewise see and behold the glory, which thou shalt give me after I have
passed through these evils and have finished my whole passion, that also they
may learn by affliccions to go to the eternal joy, and by reproach and
ignominte, to go to immortal glory. For it is no new glory which thou shall
give me, nor new charity wherewith thou love me: but therefore thou show
tokens and arguments among men, of thy love toward me, to the intent that
those which will be mine, should by like way and mean cumpasse and seek for
thy love: and by like deeds labor to be promoted unto the glory of heaven.
They whom thou have vouchesafed to love, and shall allow them as wurthy thy
glory, have been loved of the before the creacion of the world.

O righteouse father, nothing has been ouerslipt or omitted of me, whereby
thou should have been brought to be known of all folk, but the world
being for the more part blinded in the sin and faults thereof, would not
know thee, because it would not believe me, whiles I taught thee unto the
world. But I being pure from the world, have known thee, and have taught
thee being known unto me. Neither has my preaching been altogether in vain.
They, whom thou specially did chose for that purpose, have known thee by
me: they knew that I came from thee, although the Phariseis with open clamoure
says, that I came from Beelzebub the prince of deiuils. But as thy goodness
had sent me to have saved all folk, if it could by any way have been brought
to pass, so thy righteousness will not suffer the desires of the faithful to
be frustrate and void, for the infidelity of some that be unfaithful.

The learned, the potentates, the chief heads of religion, have contemned thy
doctrine, but these rude, ignorant, meke and unlearned persons, have by me
received the knowleage of thy name: and I shall cause it to be more and more
known unto them, that thou may with the same great charitable love wherewith
thou enbracest me, likewise enbrace them: and so they being more fully taught
by my spirit, may on their behalf again both love us, and one of them by
mutual gentleness, nourishe, cherishe, and defend each one the other. For so
shall they be strong against all the troublesome hurly burlies of this world,
and shall persist unvanquished.

The. xviii. Chapter.

WIth this kind of talk, our Lord Jesus did confirm, stablishe, and bolden
the hertes of his, and after he had so done, and commended his flock to his
father, he departed thence of his own voluntary will, to go mete them, that
should apprehende him: therein declaryng plainly to his disciples, that he
would willynglye and gladly suffer, whatsoever pain should be put unto him:
for it was midnight, and except it had been a well known place, he could not
have been taken. Therefore he departed out of that place whereas he had thus
spoken to his disciples. And when he was goen over the brook which the
Hebrews call Cedron, because many Cedre trees grow there, he and his
disciples waiting on him, went into a gardeyne: not ignorant that Judas
would come thither with a band of harueysed men to attache him, because Judas
that betrayed him, knew full well that our Lord Jesus was wont often to
get himself Secretly thither, late in the night with his disciples, to
pray. They took the night time for this cause, lest the company that Jesus
had with him; should make resistance, and let them to take him.

For Judas that was of a disciple become a traytoure, and of a cumpanion to him
that was a redemer made a captain of theuishe soldiers, came into the
gardeyne (where the lord being with his disciples, prayed) with the ba^d of
men which he had taken unto him by the appoyntmente of the Bishops and
Phariseis, with whom he had couenaunted to betraye Jesus, and bring him into
their hands: And verily they brought with them, fierbrandes and lanternes, by
means whereof he might be discerned and known in the night. Nor they came not
without sweardes and staves against the force and violence of Christ's
disciples, if percase any would have proffered to defend their lord. Howbeit
Jesus knowing all things that were wroughte and dooen against him, to teach
plainly that himself wittingly and willingly did suffer all that he suffered,
not tarying for their cumming, went forward to mete them as they were cumming
toward him, and of his own mind unforced, asked them whom they sought:
lest for lack of knowledge, they might have laid hands upon some of his
disciples. And when they had answered him, Jesus of Nazareth, he said boldly
unto them: I am very he whom ye seek. There was then also Judas Iscarioth
present, and his band of me^ with him: which Judas had a little before
betrayed Jesus with a kiss under a false pretended frendeship, ere the Lord
had spoken these words. Yet did Jesus neither in the mean time bewray him,
of whom he was betrayed, nor spoke any rough and rebukefull words against the
soldiers that were hired to attache him: because he would still even till all
were fully ended, show his disciples exaumple of gentleness and modeste
meekness. But as soon as Jesus had said unto them: I am he, the band of men
being soore afraid went backwardes and fell to the ground, not able to
sustain and abide the violence of the Lords voice.

After that they were come to themselfes again, and made ready to set upon
Jesus the secound time, the Lord asked them once again, whom they did seek.
And when they had now answered as before, saying they sought Jesus of
Nazareth, he made them a like bold answer, as he had done before, and said: I
toulde you even very now, that I am the same manne ye look for. And if ye seek
me, I do license you to meddle only with me: suffer ye therefore these to go
their way, against whom I give you no interest at this present. The cause why
Jesus did thus, was to declare by a manifest toke^, that he could not have been
apprehended, except he had permitted himself to be taken, in that he had once
with one word put back and cast down to the ground, both a desperate and
an armed multitude of soldiers, and Judas self too, that shameless traitor.
Moreover like as he gave the^ leave to take himself, so on the other side he
restrained them from having power over his disciples: because he had told
beforehande, that the fierceness of that storm, should for that present time
light upon his own head alone, and as for the rest, although they were
somewhat overthrown and deiect, yet should they be safe without hurt until
he should see them again: herein declaring himself to play the part of a
good shepeherde, which redemeth the health of his flock with the loss of his
own life.

Now then Simon Peter which bore a notable ardente love toward his Lord,
because he had made a great braggue of himself, no less then that he would be
content to dye to save his Lords life, seeing the armed band of men to lay hand
upon Jesus, forgot what the Lord had said unto him. And so being in a sudden
rage, drew out a sword, not tarying to be commanded of his Lord to do it,
and stroke the Bishops servant whose name was Malchus, but the stroke light
not as he would have had it: he only stroke of the fellows right ear, even
according as the Lord did stay his hand, to the intent he should give but a
small wound. Howbeit Jesus did forthwith of his own gentleness heal the man
again. And in deed ye Lord suffered him that should be a ruler of his
church, to fall (of a godly zeal truly) into this error, for that he might
afterward more surely and more effectuously put away all desire to do
vengeance, and shake of altogether private revenging and use of weapons, since
he had once rebuked him which as yet having no contrary commandment, did of
very devotion, and of a godly affeccion, go about to defend his most
virtuous godly Lord against the wicked. So then Jesus verily put away by his
divine power, the force of the men of war from Peter, but yet withal he
chideth Peter as a disciple, when he sees him hotely set to fight out the
matter, and says: Peter, what do thou? Have thou forgotten what thou have
heard of late whiles thou did exhort me not to dye? that is to wit, how
thou wast called Satan, and commanded to follow behind. To what purpose is
thy sword drawn, because thou would hinder my death, which I go to
suffer willingly, and appointed so to do by my father?

It becummeth the to follow, and not to repel my cross. Therefore put thy
sword into thy sheath. Matters of the ghospel are not so to be defended. It
thou will succeed me as my vicar, thou must fight with no other swerd than of
Gods word, which cutteth away sins, and saves the men. Shall not I drink
of this cup of death, which my father has given me to drink? How shall it
come to pass all we to be one, according as I prayed to my father, except
that like as I do obey the fathers will even to the very death, so you
likewise obey my commandments?

The disciples being with this saying restrained and stayed from fightyng, the
men of war and their captain, with the ministers also whom the Bishops
and Phariseis sent to augment the number, laid their wicked hands upon Jesus,
and led him fast bound as a malefactor, first to Bishop Annas, Caiphas father
in law. Caiphas verily was the hye Bishop of that year, therefore they led Jesus
from Annas house to Caiphas, of whom it was spoken before, that whiles other
were perplexed and in doubt what was to be done with Jesus, he being (for the
office sake that he bare) inspired with the spirit of prophecy, cou^sailed
that in any case Jesus should finally suffer death, because it was so expedient
for all folk that the health and salvation of the people should be recovered
and redeemed with the death of one man. Jesus therefore was led unto Caiphas
father in-lawe, first to feed his iyes with a sight that was wished and longed
for: also that he might be examined in this man's house, if they could find any
lykelyhode of any fault in him. For although they had such bloudsuckyng
hertes, as could have been content to have murdered their own pare^tes, yet
for fear of the people, and of the lieutenant Pilate, they studied to pretend
some color of justice, but Gods prudence turned the wicked subtle craft of
man, into the glory of his son. For whylest he is thus taken, thus led from
Annas to Caiphas, from Caiphas to Pilate, from Pilate to Herod, and back
again from Herod to Pilate, whiles he is examined of many, and of many
matters accused, he made them all witnesses and confessors of his innocence,
yea they that were his enemies. And verily there is no more certain testimony
of innocence, then that which truth forces out of an enemy. How little
equity did they show mete for a Bishop? They bought the betraying of an
innocent with money, they arested and took a naked man without armor, with a
band of armed men hired for that purpose: they bound him that made no
resistance, but that he had only showed great lykelyhood how great his power
was, in case he would have used it, and willingly gave himself unto them: they
led him not to a judge, but to an enemy, as men auaunting themselfes of their
pray, and there finally sought they for a fault to be laid against him,
when as the equity even of profane laws, will no man to be arested except
first a man be most hated for his naughtines, and so burdened with a fault.

Now then when Jesus was brought thither, that is, to Cayphas, Simon Peter,
notwithstanding that he was forbid fightyng, nevertheless having yet some
confidence in his own strength, followed Jesus, and a certain other disciple
with him: even the same that a little before leaned on Jesus breast at supper
time. This disciple because he was known to the Bishop, was bold in trust of
that knowledge, to go into the palace with Jesus. Peter because he was not
known, Peter stood at the door without.
durst not follow them into the palace, but tarried at the door without, in the
mean time much swaruyng from that bold saying: I will venture my life for
the. And yet some manliness remained in him for all that. For it came of love
that he durst still follow unto the door, seeing the rest of his fellows
scatter themselves abroad each one a sere way: but in that he durst not go in,
was a fear, and did pronosticate that he should soon after deny his Lord.
Howbeit that other disciple perceyuyng that Peter followed not, spoke to the
damsel that kept the door, to take in him which stood at the door without.
And when the maid had let him in she beheld Peter, and thought she should
know him: both because she had seen him in Jesus cumpany, and specially
because he was commanded to be brought in of him, whom she knew to be Jesus
disciple. And therefore she said unto Peter: Art not thou also this man's
disciple, which is now taken and brought in hither? At this voice of a woman
of small reputacion, which yet pretended no kind of cruelty or thing to be
feared, seeing she compared Peter with him whom she did not appeache nor
violently handle, and knew him to be Jesus disciple, and so named Jesus unto
him, calling him in such sort a man, as though she had rather pitied him
then disdayned him: Peter, I say, for all this suddenly forgetting al things
which Jesus had so often repeted unto him, and forgetting also his own stout
promise, denied that he was Jesus disciple. And even this is the first
profession of them that be desirouse to mortise themselfes in princes houses,
verily to deny Christ, that is to say, the truth. And when Peter was thus
gotten in, he went and stood among the Bishops officers and servants which
were standing by the fire side to warm themselfes, because it was cold that
late time of the night. And Peter warmed him with them, trustyng that he so
might keep himself secret, and in the mean time see what should become of
Jesus in conclusion, and what issue this matter should draw to, for as yet
Peter had not put away all hope that his Lord should escape death although
he was so stricken with fear, that he did not once think of that the Lord had
even newly before told him would be, that is to were, that Peter's self for all
he was a bold promiser, would forswear his Lord and master.

Now the Bishop Cayphas to show some semblaunce of rightful judgment, but
yet his intent was to gather somewhat of Jesus sundry answers, that he might
charge him withal as a man faultye, and therefore he questioned with Jesus of
his disciples, what manner of men they were, whence he had them, and to what
purpose he had gathered such a cumpanye together, yea and also what he
secretly taught them: Howbeit Jesus knowing that he did not demand these
questions of a right iudgelyke mind to know the truth, but deceytfully to
hunte out some thing in him worthy blame, and to get occasion withal how
to harm his disciples, whom he would yet should be in safegarde, Jesus, I say,
knowing this made no answer to the Bishops wily and traiterouse
interrogacions, but banyssheth the testimony of himself and his, and sends
them to the common report, and also to the record of his enemies, a proof of
most certainty for the innocent, and says unto the Bishop: Why ask thou
me what I have taught my disciples secretly or in hugger mugger? My doctrine
has not been sediciouse nor secret. I have spoken openly to the broad
world. That which I have taught, I have always taught it in your Synagogues.
I have taught in the temple upon the holy days, in place and time most
notable and famous, whither Jews on every side out of all parts of Syria
resort. And I have spoken nothing in priuitie or corners, which same thing I
durst not teach openly. I ever taught in the Synagogue.
Full often has the people and Phariseis too, heard me. Why then do thou
now ask me of such manner of doctrine as should be taught by stelth and very
privily? But rather ask them, that have heard me teach openly. Their record
shall be of more certaintye which has with me no familiar acquaintance, yea
of whom some do hate me. Let even them that be mine enemies report what I have
taught: for many know it, and it shall be easy to find witnesses of my
doctrine. When Jesus had spoken these things, teaching thereby that the truth
is to be answered for, boldly in deed, but without tauntes or rebukes, one of
the bishops ministers that by chance stood next him, a man not unlike his
lord and master, willing to defend his bishops dignity against the frank
and liberal speech of Jesus, after such like sort as Peter would have
defended his masters life against the force of the soldiers, not tarrying for
any commandment of his lord, gave Jesus a blow upon the cheke and such a
checkeful rebuke as was fit for such a bishop, and such a fellow his servant,
saying: Aunswerest thou the bishop so? Our Lord Jesus might both have
destroyed this wicked bishop, and also have let this blowgeuer, but that he
would show by exaumple to his, how far out of course and how perverse the
judgments of the world be. For our Lord Jesus which behaved himself most
mekely against all injuries, being no where so sharp as against them that
under the pretense of religion bark and work against true religion, took
not the blow without replying in words, which yet endured the cross and
made no words thereat. The bishops sat in authority, Jesus being bound was
examined: here lo was a face of judgment. And of truth before a temporal
judge being but an Heathen, he that is accused shall be heard to say for
himself. Here now before a bishop, a blow was given for making one answer,
and the blow too was given him that afterward should be judge of the quick
and the dead.

And so in deed Jesus answered, in deed frankely, but yet mildly and coldely,
saying: I speak before a judge, and I answer him being required. In this
case before Gentiles also is the matter handled with good reasons, and not with
strokes. If I have said any thing amiss tell me how: but if I have spoken
nothing evil, why do thou being a judges officer, here in time of
judgment, the judge holdyng his peace, beat me without consultyng the thing
that I say?

Uerily Annas, although upon malice he reioysed that Jesus was under ward, and
had in hold, nevertheless because he could try out nothing of him, whereby he
might by any color be proved giltye: he sends him even bound as he was to
bishop Caiphas his son in law. But in the mean time whilst these things
were in handlyng, Peter vewyng all things a far of, which as I begun to
tell, stood in the throng of the ministers, warmyng him at the fire side and
among these some there were which by certain tokens somewhat knew Peter, and
said unto him: Art not thou one of this man's disciples whom the bishop
thus handles? Peter seeing so cruel a sight, which made him also sore
afraid, once again denied that he was Jesus disciple. For he now perceived
by the bishops interogatyues, how that they were in deuyse to attache Jesus
disciples: also Peter thought by this denial to be safe from danger, like as
he had shifted himself from her that kept the door, but to make him know the
better, how he could nothing do of his own propre strength being disseuered
from the fellowship of his Lord, there stood among other in that throng of the
ministers, a certain kinsman of him that had a little before in the garden first
auentured to lay hands upon Jesus, and had his ear stricken of by Peter. This
fellow was by the judgment of god brought in as an instrument, under pretense
to avenge his cosen Malchus harm, but in very deed it was to correct the
rash confidence that Peter had in himself. For the said fellow being not
content with Peter's only one denial (for his fighting though it were done in
the dark, made him to be well known) says unto Peter: What (says he) do
thou deny thy self to be one of his disciples? Did not I even right now see
the with mine iyes in the garden with Jesus? Peter being with this saying
utterly blancke and sore astonished, wished himself accursed if ever he knew
Jesus. And anon the cock crewe. Neither did Peter by this token, which our
Lord had told him of before, come to himself again, neither would have
been well advised, except our Lord had recovered him, and brought him to
himself again by his effectual lokyng upon Peter: and had also by inward
inspiracion provoked tears of penance in him.

So many ways was he that should be a special minister under Christ of the
holy church, to be taught how in all things to mistrust his own strength, and
to depend of his lords only aid and succor. Now therefore after that Jesus
had been all the night long till the morning early, in examinacion before
Caiphas, nor no fault could be found in him, wherefore he ought to be
called for, and to be arrained upon life and death, they have him out of
bishop Caiphas house, and lead him to Pilate the lord presidente, to
thentente they might charge him, and discharge themselves of the hatred that
they should be in for sheading of innocent blood. And even being bound as he
stood, Jesus was led by the hired soldiers into the presidentes judgment
hall. Howbeit the Jews themselves went not into the house of judgment, lest
they should be polluted, in as much as the paschall lamb must be eaten of
them: to the eating whereof they would go pure and clean, but of a naughty
perverse religion be ye sure, considering that they thought themselves to be
contaminate and suspended with the harmless house of the president, because
he was a Ge^tile and no Jew, when as themselves by many crafts went about and
devised a man's death, that had done nothing amiss, yea that had many ways
done well and deserved much good at their hands.

Therefore Pilate after he saw the uncouth and that new manner of judgment, as
a man to be in captivity and bounde^ ere he were examined and heard of the
judge, and to see a band of harnessed men, he comes forth abroad himself to
be polluted with such men's communicacion, as thought themselves pure and
unpolluted. And verily he came out to appease and assuage, if it were possible,
the furye of the Jews, and so to quite the innocente. Ye send (says he)
this manne unto me to be put to death. But it is not the manner of Rome to put
any man to execucion, except him that is proved guilty of a fault worthy
death. What crime therefore do ye lay to this man's charge? The Jews
answered: the authority of Bishops, and Phariseis is enough for your
discharge. If this man were not a malefactor we could not of our profession
have committed him to your hands. Pilate suspectyng, as the truth was, them
to have some private grudge toward him about the supersticion and the
superf^uous religion, and vain devotion of the law, says unto them: If it
be any matter that apperteyneth not to my count and office, as for exaumple,
if case the Sabbath day be broken, if any swynes flesh be eaten, or percase
some rash and liberal words has been spoken against Moses, the Prohetes,
the Temple, or your God: lo, now if any such escape have been, which your
own law commanded to be punished, though yet there be no such thing
prohibit by the law of Rome, your selfs take the man unto you and judge him
after your law. I am set here in the Emperors name to rule and play the
Judge. If he has committed any fault against the Emperors laws, worthy
death, bring him to me, and after he be conuicte by the law, and lawfully
cast, I shall cause him to be put to execucion. But I will not intermedle and
perplexe my self in doubtful matters of your law. Uerily, though the Jews
would (they forced not how) have had him made away, yet for all that they
pretend reliousnesse of very fear, lest the judge should forthwith have
punished the^, because they would have killed an harmless and an uncondemned
person. But at the same time they sought effectually a new kind of punishment
for him, such one as was then among the Jews most spytefull and opprobrious.
It is not, say they, lawefull for us to put any man to death. The shameless
people spoke these words which had slain so many Prophets: flatteryng
themselfes as clean from murder, notwithstanding they did so many ways
persecute an innocente to death: or else they thus did, as if the hangman which
with his hands fasteneth the man to the cross, were a sole murderer. They
were in heart murderers, they were murderers in their tongues, with their money
they hired one traitorously to betray him, they hired a sort of warryers, they
hired false witnesses, they forged false haynouse crimes against him. They
provoke and prycke forward the judge, and with threatening make him a fearde,
and yet impute themselves pure and fre from murder, and also worthy to eat the
Pascall Lamb, for no cause else, but that they did stay and refrain themselves
from going into the judgment hall. Well these things truly were done to make
it appear euidente that there is nothing wurse or more haynouse then false and
perverse religion, and that the same thing also should be brought to effect,
which Jesus said should come to pass, signifying by a parable what death he
should dye, when he spoke these words: At such time as I shall be lift up
on hye from the ground, I shall draw all things unto me: by the force of
which words, he would that we should take it for a certainty that not only
the self death was determinately limited unto him, but also a choice and
several kind of death.

Wherefore then after that Pilate understanding by the words which the Jews
had spoken of a matter (I know not what) among other things to be obiecte
against Jesus, concerning a kingdom that he should go about desirously (and
yet there appeared no likelihood at all in Jesus that should cause any manne
to think him fauty therein) Pilate, I say, after this, went once again into
the judgment halle, and left the people standing without. And so called for
Jesus secretly aside, that quietly and without all ruffle, he might boult out
and gather of him (which in countenance appeared no less then both virtuous
and wise) what the matter was, and said unto him: Art thou that king of the
Jews whom they are reported to look for? This one thing did Pilate diligently
search out, because the other matters touched not the weal public: but this
faul^e, to call himself a king, seemed to concerue both the Emperors Majesty,
and a common peace and tranquillity. And truly Pilate made this search and
inquiry not that he did take it to be true, but to get some matter of him that
was accused, wherewith he might reprove ye Jews of falsehood. Howbeit though
Jesus knew well enough the Jews to have falsely appeached him that he should be
desirous of a kingdom to the Emperors loss, or in despite of his highness,
yet to the intent he might open and disclose the malice of the Jews, and
commend the reasonableness and equity much better in Pilate then in the
Bishops and Phariseis, though he were but a Gentyle, and set naught by the
Jews religion: for this skill, I say, Jesus made him answer, saying:
Whether think thou of thine own conjecture, that I am desyrouse of a
kingdom, or have the Jews accused me hereof to thee? Pilate both to declare
his own innoce^cie and the malice of the Jews too, says: I do not
conjecture this of mine own head, neither do I see in thee any thing agreeable
thereunto. It is a Jews tale of a king to come. Think thou me to be a Jew?
Thy quarelling country folks and the Bishops, committed thee into my hands,
seking all the means they can to have thee put to death, but because it is not
the fashion of Rome to put any uncondemned person to death, if therefore thou
haste not tra^sgressed in ye traiterous desire of a kingdom, then what fault
beside haste thou made? Because Pilate asked him of these things simply, and
meaning good faith, entending to deliver the innocente, Jesus did vouchesafe to
answer him by a rydle and prouerbially: teaching that it was an other manner
of kingdom whereof the Prophets had spoken, a far more excellent kingdom then
is the kingdom of this world, which consists in man's laws, in the aid of
me^, which have no power, but upon bodies. Howbeit he signified this kingdom to
be an heavenly kingdom, which could not covet ye kingdom of the world, but
contemn it: and should not harm it, but auaunce it into a better kind. My
kingdom, says Christ, is no such kingdom as ye Emperors is, his kingdom is
terrestrial, My kingdom is not of this world. etc.
but mine is celestial. And for ye cause am I affeccionate to nothing that can
harm the Emperors majesty. If my kingdom were of this world, the world
should not handle me as it does, unrevenged. For even I, be ye sure, should
have (as other kings has) a guard of harnessed men. I should have squiers for
the body, and such as should only attend upon mine own person: I should
have plenty of well appointed men, and lack no aid or succoure that would
fight for me, that it should not be in the Jews power to do the thing they
go about against me unrequired.

At this present I have few disciples, and those that I have be unapt to
war, weak and poor, I my self being unarmed and no wartyer, even one that
seeks to the help of other, because my kingdom is not of this world.

Forasmuch as Pylate being a lay man and a Gentile did not fully understand
this mistye and dark saying, albeit he heard that Jesus did not utterly
ren^unce and deny the name of a king, but did put a difference of kingdoms,
Pilate therefore said unto him: Is it then true that thou art somewhere a king
whatsoever kind of kingdom it be, and thou not perteynyng to us? Here now
Jesus being earnestly asked of the judge whether he were any way a king, or
nay, confesses the truth with great temperaunce and modestye, with much
sobriety and good aduisemente, aunsweryng thus: Thou say I am a king, for
whosoever asks a question, with like number of words, the pronunciacion
only changed, affirms the thing. And Jesus said further: It is not my
part to deny any truth, namely consyderyng that for this cause I was borne,
and came into the world, that I should deceive no man with any lie, but that I
should bear witness unto the truth.

He that has a simple meke mind not blinded with the lusts and desires of
this world, acknowlegeth, lyketh well, and hears my voice. But Pilate having
no further intelligence of that which was spoken, For this cause was I borne,
etc
then that he supposed the thing to be no matter for him to know, and as yet
Christ had made Pilate no apt answer, therewith either to set the Jews
at a quiet or to dispatche them thence, after he had asked of Jesus what was
that truth whereof he spoke, and was come into the world to bear witness
thereof: Pilate, I say, went out again unto the Jews, not tarrying for an
answer of the thing, that he questioned of. What needs many words, says
Pilate: I have examined the man, and can find no fault in him worthy death.
Nor I am not here president and chief justice under the Emperor, because I
should with my sentence condemn the innocente, but in case he be noisome to
you, and that ye think him fautye (which I find not) yet it stands with
equity and good indifferency, that if ye will not spare and forbear him as an
innocent, at leastwaye in the honor of this holy feast and for religion sake,
pardon him his life as an offender. And in deed it is here a custom among
you that in this feast of Phase (which is of you most highly solemnised and
kept most holy of all feasts,) I should at your request pardon and set at
liberty some one offender. Therefore ye shall have free eleccion to chose the
one of twain, either Barrabas that arrant these and notable robber, a
disturber of the public peace, or this Jesus, a man in my judgment
fautlesse, whom some folk says is the king of Jews. It were best surely
that this man, yea though he have done amysse, should feel and enjoy the
graciouse favor and privilege of your solemn feast.

Will ye therefore that I forgive this person for your sakes? for of truth the
president did not look for so great outragiousnes in the Jews, that they
would prefer a fellow openly known full of mischief, and a valiant rank
thief, before Jesus a man most meke and innocent. But the Jews with a whole
consen^ and with a great loud voice, cried all of them: We will not have Jesus
given us, but Barrabas.

The.xix. Chapter.

AFter that Pilate, the Emperors Lieutenaunt, had also by occasion sent Jesus
to Herod, leauyng nothing undone either to shifte and rid his hands of him
that was accused, or else to dimisse and set him looce as an innocent: when
the lord president (I say) had thus assayed all ways* and saw he could do
no good with the furiouse folks of the Jews, he than commanded Jesus to be
scourged, as the manner was at Rome, which feat he did to assuage their fury,
and to save the innocents life. This done, the soldiers that were in the
inner court, of whom the Jews had hired a number to serve their tyranny,
did of their own inue^cion add much cruel fearcenesse to that uncouth
solemn piece of his passion: for when he had been so scourged and beaten, to
mock him withal, they put upon him a purple garment, and wound a croune of
thorn, and put it on his head, geuyng him a reed in his hand instead of a
scepter, and byanby castyng him in the tethe with a kingdom that he should be
desirous of, who (God wotte) was to see to, an homely, a base, and a contempt
person, they came and kneled unto him, saying: Hayle king of Jews. And they
spitted upon his face, and buffeted him, Hayle king of the Jews.
he being Lord of all things and behauing himself most pacientely and most
coldly in all their kind of mockage, for to teach us len^tye and patience in
adversity: us (I say) that have hautye and very fierce minds, though yet in
deed we be things of naught. Sothe it is, that Pilate suffered Jesus thus to
be dealt withal, because he would with this the man's affliccion, have appeased
the malice of the Jews: for when the people has for a while raged against
whom they be sturred, their fury cease suddenly, namely, if scornyng be added
to the calamity, and make him that suffers, lamentable, where before he was
hated.

Therefore Pilate the presidente went furthe unto them again, for to prove if
he could mitigate the fiercenes of the mean multitude, and says: Lo, I
bring out the manne unto you, that ye may look your fill upon him, and
perceive how he has been handled for your pleasure, not withstandyng that I
can find no fault in him. And so therewith Jesus (at Pilates commandment)
cummeth forth as he was appareled, bound, scourged and beat, bespitted,
crowned with a crown of thorn, and wearyng the purple garment. And Pilate
presented him, saying: Behold the man is here.

With this sight therefore, which had been enough to have tamed the cruelty
(had it been never so great) of wild and rude barbarouse people, the minds yet
of the Jews were not only not mollified, but were therewith more set on fire
to finish the thing that they had so far proceeded in. For the bishops were
now afeard, lest if he, which had been so horribly and so cruelly tormented,
should now have been let looce, that then the affeccion and mind of the
people, that were already set on a roar, being once turned on the other
side, the grudge of their extreme great cruelty, might light upon their own
heads. The bishops therefore and their servants, with a great stier and shone
cried woodly out, crucify him, crucify him: Pilate perceiving that there was
no hope of pity to be gotten at their hands by fair entreaty, he goes
about to restrain and bridle in their fury with fear, and says: I am a
minister of law and justice, and not a reue^ger of other folks malice: and by
lawful process to punish trangressours of the law, am I autorisate: I am no
butcherly murderer, no bloudshedder of innoce^cie. This that has been done,
was to serve and satisfy your hatred. I will no more be fierce against him
that is no noisome person. And if he shall algates be crucified, I will not
have this my court of judgment distayned and polluted with the blood of an
innocente. Upon your own peril have ye the man away: and if it seems good,
do ye crucify him. I am not wounte to crucify any but wicked doers. In this
man I find no crime that deserves the cross. For there is no likelihode in
him of that trayterouse deed which is laid to his charge, concerning the
kingdom. Nor it is not enough to accuse a man of a fault, except it be proved
to be a matter of certainty, that is objected, by sure evidence: specially if
it be a cause that concerns life and death. This whole matter is by no lawful
process handled, but ruffeled out sediciously. When the Jews heard Pilate the
judge so frendely and diligently withal, take Jesus part and defend him, and
utterly thinking it not mete that any way Jesus should escape, they falsely
surmised a crime which might seem to the judge that was not learned in their
law, a greuouse fault, saying: Although he had done none offense against the
Emperors laws, yet have we a law given us of God: which the Emperor also
has left unto us: And by the force of this law he has well deserved to dye,
because he has made himself the son of God, and taking upon him the
godhead, he did commit blasphemy against God. After that Pilate had heard
this, having no ready answer to make them, he led Jesus again into the
judgment hall, and went in himself, and talked again with Jesus, being very
desyrouse to learn of him what a thing that was wherewith they charged him,
and how it might be refelled and avoided. Therefore, first of all Pilate
asks him whence he was, to the intent that after he had known of what
progeny he came, he might have confuted that, whereas they said he was
desirouse to be taken for the son of God: though in deed among the Gentiles
it was both written in Poets fables, and commonly believed, that some were
taken for half gods, as folks borne of God and manne. But verily Jesus
knowing that Pilate did assaye all these ways finally to save his life, and
was not ignoraunte that yet Pilate should afterward (when all means had been
proved) give place to the obstinate furye of the Jews, Jesus (I say) would
make no answer at all unto the president, lest he should be thought to have
made any mean how to get out of their hands, because he would not seem to
be compelled to death. And that hitherto he made answer, was because he would
have record of his innoce^cie, but his pleasure was to dye willingly and
gladly.

Pylate meruaylyng at the man's silence standing in hasarde of his life,
considering he had the judge so much his friend that he did provoke him to
answer, said: Why do not thou that art in ieoperdye of life make me an
answer? know thou not that I have power and authority over thee, whyther
thou shall live or dye? for I am the presidente and chief justice of this
region. And it depends upon my will and pleasure, whether thou shalt be
crucified, or quitte and let looce. Unto these words Jesus made no such
answer as the presidente looked for, which presidente desired to be
instructed for the defense of Jesus cause, intendyng to be in stead of a
judge, an advocate on the defendauntes side. But because that way it should
somewhat have appeared that Jesus had not been willing to have dyed, he
answered no such like thing: But his answer was only concerning the power
which Pylate did arrogantelye attribute to himself: signyfying that it was
neither in Pylates power to set him at liberty (seeing that the power which
he had should condescende to the fury of the Jews,) nor that Pilate himself
should be able to do ought against him, except he would of his own
voluntary will, suffer it: of truth thou have (says Jesus) power according
to man's laws, but thou could have no power on me, unless it had been
permitted thee of him, whose power passes all man's power. And in deed thou
fauourest innocence, but yet the naughtines of other ouercummeth thee, and
leads thee from the right trade. Wherefore the people of the Jews, which be
the auctours of this my passion and death, and that with their violence
constrayneth the judge to condemn an innocent person, sin more grievously.
When Pilate heard this, and thereby perceived both the modesty and the
clearenes of him, that was accused, and that also the malice of the Jews, yea
and his own indifferency too, was not unknown to the same, and the more
Pilate favored him, because he saw that the manne was nothing moved or
disquieted, no not with the peril of death that he stood in: when Pilate
considered all this, he wrought al manner ways, that at least by some means,
he might clear and set Jesus at liberty. The Jews perceyuyng the same, and
that the presidente made light of the crime which first was laid against him
concerning Moses law, and that he ceased not to do all that he could, to
dimisse Jesus, they fall in hand again with the first fault, which to be
neglecte they declare to be dangerous to the judge himself, and say
therefore. Though it do not appertayne^ unto the that he has offended against
our God, certainly whereas he has offended against the Emperor, thou haste to
do withal.

Whosoever makes claim to a kingdom without the Emperors commandment,
offends in the crime of lease majesty, Whosoever makes himself a king is
against Ceasar.
and commits hye treason: But this fellow makes himself a king, if thou
therefore do let loo^e and acquit him, thou which fauourest his enemy, art not
y^ Emperors friends. After that Pilate had heard the Bishops and Phariseis,
that were conspired together against Jesus, and the main multitude withal, cry
out these words aloude, although he was not ignorant that they went about a
false matter, yet because he saw well that the malice which the priests and
Phariseis bare toward Jesus could not be appeas^d, and saw also that the
headmen, and the common people were wunderfully consentyng to the said grudge,
and malice, and all they with one agreement brute to take away this one man's
life: furthermore when Pilate perceived also Jesus to be (in deed) nothing
fawtie at al, but simple and a poor innocent man, that made no shifte for
himself, and likewise thought in the mean time, how that under Emperors
many had been in daungerouse hasarde of very envy, without any just cause: And
thought too, of himself, that he already had sufficiently traueiled against
the whole conspiracy agreed upon between the noble men, and the commons, in
the defense of one poor man's innocence: Pilate (I tell you) upon these
skilles, determined with himself to condescende and satisfy their malice, but
in such sort that in condemning Jesus, he thought withal to get him his
pardon and deliverance: and beginning to speak first of his own innoce^cie,
derived the grudge of the wicked fact unto the Jews, and laid it upon their
heads. Now than was Jesus therefore brought forth as guilty, when as in
condemnyng of him no kind of lawful judgment was used: Pilate sat down in
the place of lawful judgment on hye, to give sentence, and he sat in a high
place to be seen of all folk, and of the height it is called of the Hebrews
Gabatha: the Greeks verily call it Lithostrotos, because it was paued. It was
the preparyng day of Easter about the si^te hour.
For so it behooves Jesus condemnacion to be solemn, and public, lest his
innocence should be hid from any man. For so to be condemned was to be
quitte and cleared. Jesus was delivered up to the cross, but the judge gave
sentence upon the Jews. And now the time drew nigh, that according to the
manner of the solemn feast, innocente blood should be offered in sacrifice
for the salvation of the world, for it was the Sabbath even, now called good
friday, which falls in the Easter feast, about the sixth hour. And therefore
the Jews called more vrgently upon the matter, unwittingly doing thereby
service to the thing that God appointed: that is, to have this sacrifice made
in conueniente time and due season. And so than Pilate now by reason of his
Judicial garment plainly seen and perceived of the people, showed unto them
out of the Judgment place the accused person, to thentente that even by the
sight of him and his facion, it might appear how vnconueniently the crime of
any cruel authority that he should be desirouse of, for his private commodity,
was laid against him: who being so vexed and troubled, showed such great
quietness of mind, and so great mildnes. Pilate (I say) showed them this
person, and said: Behold your king. But the Jews which thirsted for nothing
else but innocent blood, cried: away with him, away with him: Crucify him. The
infamous and reprochefull death pleased well the Jews, trusting it would come
to pass, that ye shame and reproach of the cross, would make the name of
Jesus odious and detestable, and that there should no man come after, which
should profess his name being in such wise made away. Pilate deriding their
obstinate madness, says: what (quodhe) shall I do so great a vilanie unto
your king as to nail him unto the Cross?

This dishonor shall redound to the shame and slander of all the people which
have brought their king to the cross. This voice of Pilate, although it did
Jesus no good, yet it disclosed the malice of the Jews, and forced them to
confess openly, and to knowledge a servitude, which they hated. The Jews had
desired and looked for many hundred years their Messiah, that is to were, a
king promised of the Prophets. As for the Emperors kingdom (wherewith they
were sore pressed and ouerlayed) they had spitefully hated: yet that not with
standing, being through envy and hatred waxed wild, and even wood, they
renounce openly in the face of the world, their Messiah: and acknowledge the
Emperor for their soueraygne Lord: We have (say they) no king but the
Emperor. The lust to revenge was so great, that vnconstrayned they adjudged
themselves to perpetual bondage, that they might thereby utterly extinguish
Jesus, the author of liberty. Pilate therefore seeing all that he went about,
disapoynted: committed Jesus unto them to be crucified at their order and
liberty.

The Jews took the deliuerye of Jesus being brought out of the place of
judgment, and led him to the place of execucion, which was without the city,
that the place might also answer to the figure: For the sacrifice wherewith the
testament was consecrate, was offered without the host. Jesus went thither,
having yet his garments on, to thentent he might be the more shame to them
that favored him: and he goes full mekely bearing his cross himself. For
The Jews provided that, lest there should lack any despyte or reproach.
Furthermore, a vile and a diffamed place was also chosen and appointed, wherein
the manner was to put wyked malefactors to execucion, a place perdye detestable
and violated with dead bodies, whose bones lay scatered here and there all
abroad: even a place that showed it self to what purpose it was dedicate, and
of the thing it had the common name given it. For in the Hebrew tongue it was
called Golgatha, in the Greek tongue Cranii topos, in the Latin tongue Caluarie
socus, in English, a place of dead men's sculles: and lest he should not be
put to shame enough, the Jews procured this also, that other two which
were openly known to be wicked thieves) should be crucified with Jesus
together, to thente^te that of the fellowship of them that were for
Poffenders, he might likewise be thought and taken for an offender: and like as
they had all one commune punyshemente, so to seem to have all one commune
fault. But to thentente it might utterly appear that he was a companyon of
theyrs, the Jews did so order and place the crosses, that Jesus honge in the
mids, having a thief hangyng on either hand: of him, howebeit the fountain
of all pureness could not be polluted with any fylthynes of man, yea, the
fountain of all glory is magnified and renoumed with men's reproach. The
cross being before odyouse, and a thing of reproach, was made by him a
triumphant sign, whereunto the world boweth down the head, which angels do
wurshyppe, and deuyls fear it. Jesus being then condemned, found one whom of
a thief he made a citizen of paradyse: so much vnlykelyhoode was it, that the
fellowship of punishment should defile him. And verily, lest there should
want any kind or apparaunce of just and condign punishmente, every one had
(as the manner was) his title and style given unto him, which did describe and
declare both the person and the fault. Now then, when Pilate had given to the
other their titles according to their deserving, he commanded that to the
cross of Jesus the Lord, should be fastened this ti^le and superscripcion,
Jesus of Nazareth the king of the Jews, even for this cause truly, The
writing was Jesus of Nazareth etc.
that by the very self inscripcion, he might cause both the malice of the
Jews, and the innocence of him that was crucified, to be recorded: howbeit
this title was not convenient for him, in respect of the Jews accusacion: and
yet according to that which himself confessed to the presydent, it was a
title most seming for him. For truly Iudeus does signify to the Hebrews,
confessing. And doubtless he was and is in very deed, a king and a setter of all
them at liberty, which professes his name: unto whom he gives fellowship of
the kingdom of heaven. And to bring the Bishops and the Phariseis into more
hatred thereby, Pilate provided this title to be written in three sundry
languages, in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin; whereof the first was their own
country speech, and the other two tounges (by reason of the great occupying
that they had with the Greeks, and the Romans) was so brought in among them,
that some Jews also knew the Greek and the Latin tongue. Therefore it was
provided by the president, that no man neither resiaunt there and the same
countreyman, nor stranger and resorter thither, should be ignorant of the
title. This title thus written, being odiouse unto the Phariseis, by reason
that the place was much haunted, and great was the resort and confluence
there, because that Golgatha, the mount of caluery, was nyghe unto the city,
and layefull in their sight that by casualtie passed by that way: many Jews
therefore read (I say) this superscripcion: and sum knew well the name of
Jesus of Nazareth. And how little he desired any worldly kingdom, many had
tru^ knowledge, which had seen him hyde himself when he should have been
drawn by force to a kingdom. That very king which was promised by the
prophets, and whom the Jews call Messiah, was of very truth looked for among
all the Jews. And although Pilate was ouersene herein, yet unawares he gave
him that title which did most demonstrate and notise to all folk, who he was
that hong upon the cross. For of very truth that self king of kings honge
there crucified, which by his death, did vanquishe the tirannye of the
devil. Thou ought to call it rather the token and banner of victory, than
a cross. Though all thing seemed full of shame and rebuke to the bishops,
scribes, and to the Phariseis, yet this intitleing and superscripcion did grieve
their minds, because it was more honorablye set out than they would have had
it. So great was the desire of the wicked, to abolysh a name to the which
only, all glory of the whole world ought to be given. And therefore they
treat and common with the president of chaungeing the title, and that it
should not be written, the king of the Jews, but that he did usurp and
unjustly take upon him that name. But the presydent notwithstanding that even
then unawares he did pronosticate what should follow, that is to were, that the
profession of that healthful name (which the Jews falsely denied) should
depart thence to the ready beleuyng Gentiles, that is to say, to the true
Jews in deed: yet (I say) this notwithstanding, and that also heretofore he
did condescende and follow their malice, the presydente would not alter and
change the title, but says: that I have written, I have written. For because
it was in very deed to the commodity and profit of all folk that Christ
should be put to death, and again also, it was for all men's weal that his
name should be of most fame and renoume through the whole world, by the
profession whereof, salvation should be brought to all folk.

Now therefore when the Lord Jesus was nailed (as the manner was) all naked
unto the cross, and the foresayed superscripcion above his head, the
soldiers that crucified him (according to the usage) parted among them Jesus
garments. For this thing came to them as amends and reward for their pains
taking. And forasmuch as they were four in noumbre, they so divided the
resydue of his garments save his coat (by cause they were made of soundrye
pieces and sowed together) that every manne had his part porcionately. But
than his coat or iacket, a garment verily which was more inner and nere his
body, no sewed garment, but so wouen from thouer hem to the lower, that being
leusyd or rypte, it would have been good for nothing and naught wourth.
Therefore ye soldiers thought good that it should be kept whole uncut, and
that sum one of them should have the whole iacket to whose lotte it should
chance. But not withstanding that the soldiers did these things of a
profane mind, and of a worldly purpose, yet unawares they fulfilled in their
so doing, the prophecies of the Prophets, that hereby also he might have been
known to be he, of whom the holy ghost had spoken in the Psalms thus: they
have divided mine apparel among the^, and cast lottes upon my garments. And
these things perdye, the soldiers did whiles yet the Lord honge upon the
cross alive. But there stood by ye cross of Jesus, Mary his mother,
associate with her sister Marye, the daughter of Cleophas, and Marie Magdalene.
Therefore Jesus lokynge from ye cross upon his mother, and casting his iye
withal upon the disciple whom he loved more familiarly than the rest, to
thentente that as (his clothes being distributed) he left no worldly
substance behind him, so he would leave upon earth no worldly or man's
affeccion: Jesus (I say) turned toward his mother and said: Woman behold
that thy son, poyntynge with a nod of his head, and with a wincke of his iye,
to the disciple. And turning furthwith to the disciple, says: Behold thy
mother. And verily from that time, the said disciple bore a very sons mind
and affection toward the mother of Jesus, and took the whole charge and care of
her.

When these things were done, and Jesus knew that nothing wanted perteyning to
a lawful sacrifice, yet to bring thereunto and to accomplish the Prophets
saying where he says: They gave me gall to eat, and when I was thirstye they
gave me vinegre to drink, he cried from the cross: I am athirst. For a truth
such as dye in this kind of death, are wont to be sore grieved with vehement
thirst, by reason that through the wounds of ye body, the blood is exhaust
and clean drawn out. And even this now too, did much prove and declare him to
be a very man, and to be out of doubt, punyshed to his great pain. Now tha^
a vessel full of vinegre stood there at hand, which was wont to be reached up
and given to the^ that were athirste to make them the sooner dye. The soldiers
therefore filled a sponge with vinegre, and wound it about with ysope, and
held it to his mouth. But as soon as Jesus had tasted ye vinegre, he said:
It is finished, signifying that the sacrifice was rightely done and
accomplyshed according to his fathers will, and byanby he bowed his head and
gave up the ghost.

was crucified with him, but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead
already, they brake not his legs, but one of ye soldiers with a spear
thrust him into ye side, and furthwith came there out blood and water. And he
that saw it bare record, and his record is true, and he knows that he
says true yt ye might believe also: for these things were done, that the
scripture should be fulfilled. Ye shall not break a bone of him, and again
another scripture says: They shall look on him whom they pierced. But it is
a sport an a wonder withal to hear now again in this case the perverse
religion of the Jews so far out of course and mysordred: The Jews upon a
myscheuous malice, and by wicked means, brought with violence unto the cross
an innocent, and one that had been beneficial unto them, being nothing abashed
with the relygion of the feastfull day, to do so cruel and so ungracious a
deed, but they were very supersticiouse, and made much a do about taking the
bodies of from the cross. They came unto Pilate, and besought him ye by his
commandment, the legs of them which were crucified, might be broken, to
thentent they might the sooner be dead: and then their corpses be taken down,
and had out of the way, less being seen, they should violate and break the
feastfull day. That day was a solemn great day, which (of the great
apareylyng and fournature of holy adournme^tes and dyuine service) is called of
the Greeks, Parasceue, that is to say, a preparacion. And their holy and
solemn Sabbothe day was nigh at hand, upon which day to work was a
detestable thing. For at this season the men being (ye wot well) very
precise in their relygion, after they had finished and accomplyshed so horrible
an act, as though the thing, had been well done, they bente their minds to
celebrate the sacrifice that was to be offered by Moses law, solemnly and
purely, not knowing that the very true Easter lamb was already offered up in
sacrifice.

Such a poison and so pestiferouse a thing is holiness that consists in
outward and bodily things, and has not holiness and godlynes of heart and
mind, joined and annexed unto it. Now therefore Pilate grauntyng them their
request, the soldiers brake both the thieves legs, whom they found yet
alive. And then when they were come to Jesus, because they saw him already
dead, and therefore thought it a vain and superfluous thing to break his
legs, they left them whole unbroken. For to this end and purpose were the
legs broken, One of the soldiers thrust him into ye side, and forth ^^ came
there out wat^r and blood.
that those which hung upon the cross, should the sooner give up the ghost.
But among the soldiers stood a certain man which (for the more certeintie
of the Lord Jesus death) opened his side with a spear, and immediately out of
the wound there gushed forth blood and water, in a great misterye declaryng
that his death should wash and cleanse us from sin, and the same also give
to us everlasting life and salvation. For baptism stands in water, and with
water are we baptized. And ye life of a man is in the blood. But it is
against the course of nature for water to run out of a body that is
wounded. Howbeit he that saw the thing with his iyes, testified, and bears
witness hereof: And we know his record to be true. And lest any of you
should stand in doubt whether ye may or no believe the thing, which else
might seem incredible, I assure you that Jesus himself knew that witness, to
tell truth.

And although these things seemed to be done by chance or casualtie, that is
to say, that instead of breakyng his legs, as the others were, his chance
was to have his side thruste through, yet for all that were they done by the
foresight and providence of God, and as his divine council disposed, that in
this point also, theffecte and conclusion of the thing, might answer and
agree with the prophecies of the Prophets. For among other rites and customs
wherewith Moses teaches in Exodus, that the paske or passover ought to be
observed and celebrate, he had prescribed eue^ that thing specially by name,
that is to wete, that lamb which was sacrifised, should be so slain, that no
bone of it should be broken: even thereby notyng and declaryng, that Jesus was
the very true phase or passover, the figure whereof that Mosaicall lamb did
bear, and resembled the same. For the blood of this true lamb Jesus, saves
them that believe in him from death. And the spiritual eating of this lamb,
conueyeth us being made free from the servitude of Egypt, that is to say,
from the sinful lusts of the world, and from the tyranny of sin, into an
heavenly region. And again, the holy ghost speaks thus by Zacharye: They
shall see him whom they pearsed. For he shall once come with the same body
wherewith he hong on the cross, though it be already a gloryouse body, yet
shall he show the printe of the wound to all folk, and he shall show the
unfaithful, to their rebuke, the fountain that was open all in vain to them,
that would not believe: with the flowyng and streams whereof, they might have
been cured.

And so now his death being already certain, and himself found dead by the
experience of many, it behooved furthermore that his buryall should many ways
confyrme the belefe of the resurreccion. And as Christ would (perdie) his
whole life to be base and of a low port, so he would that his burial should
be honorable, and of a great majesty, not intendyng thereby to teach us to be
careful of a sepulcher, but to thentent that those things once accomplyshed,
which concerned the abasyng of himself and the whole ministry thereof, he
might make a way to the honor and praise of his resurreccion. And in very
deed the honor which is given to a man alive, is not without either
suspicion or danger, but the honor which voluntarily we give to the dead, is
a sure wytnes of prowes, goodness, and virtue. Now therefore Joseph being a man of honor and of great power, and substance, an Aramathian* borne, which
said Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but not openly known so to be for fear
of the Jews, which had made a law that whosoever did openly confess himself
to be Jesus disciple, the same person should be cast out of the Synagoge:
Joseph (I say) came unto Pilate to whom he was well known, and desires
license of him, to take down Jesus body from the cross: when Pilate had tried
whether that he were dead or not, he was content withal. Therefore Joseph went
his way to the cross, and took down the dead corpse. In the mean season, as
one to help furthe with those things and doings, that pertayne to the
funerals: even Nicodemus also, cummeth thither, a man among the Phariseis of a
notable estimacion and dignity: and he also being a secret disciple of Jesus,
which had before that time come to Jesus in the night, because he might so
best avoid the displeasure and grudge of the Phariseis, as was before
rehearsed. These men knowing that death commonly makes an end of hatred,
trustyng upon the presidentes favor, enterprysed h^ely to honor the dead,
with whom (whiles he lived) they durst not talk openly. Nicodemus (of truth)
brought with him an ointment of myrrh and aloes ming^ed together about an
hundred pound weight, so much as, was sufficient to sweten the body, and
honorably to preserve it from corrupcion. They now therefore ioyntely together
with one common service, anointed Jesus body being taken down, on every part
with pleasant and sweet sauerye spices, and when they had well imbrued the
corpse with the odours, they wou^d it in linen clothes, that the oyntme^t
should not run of from the body. For the manner of the Jews is, after this
sort to bury, lest the bodies should corrupt and putrefie. And verily they
did this honor to the Lord Jesus as to a wurthy man, and one that was
thoroughly good: and again, they thus honored him to thentent no man should
think that he dyed for any crime or fault. For as yet, they had no hyer
opinion of him, but that he was an innocent good man and loved of god, whose
name and memory ought to have this honor done unto it, that is to say, to be
remembered as one that was envied for his virtue even to the death, a thing that
usually happens in manner to most best men. Moreover this preparacion and
great a do was even there finished, lest any man might supect that the body
had been changed. And again the Lord was buried then in a garden, nigh to the
place of the cross. In the garden was a new sepulcher lately made out of an
hard thick stone, wherein was never man laid. And albeit these things were
supposed to be done by casualtie, yet they made much for the faith of the
resurreccion. For the sepulcher could not seem to be dug up with
vndermynyng, because it was cut out of an whole sound vnholowe rock of
stone, nor none other could be thought to have risen out of it, in which he
only was la^ed. But yet Joseph and Nicodeme did not this in respect of his
resurrection, for in deed they had no hope that he should rise again, but they
were moved thus to do with a Iewishe devotion, for religion sake of the
feastfull day. For in deed it was the Jews Easter day even, and therefore the
Sabbath provoked and setforwarde this deed. In which Sabbath day it was not
lawful for them to work. Wherefore lest the body should be unburied, or the
burial be to slender, and with to small honor done, they ryd the thing out of
hand, and laid him in the sepulcher that was next unto them. Also
furthermore, even the diligence of the Jews, served for the belefe of his
resurreccion that should be. For after that the Jews had obtained of Pilate
kepers for the sepulcher, and had procured that it should be watched and
attended upon, lest any body should secretly steal a way the dead corpse,
they not content therewith, close up the mouth of the sepulcher, with a great
stone, and seal it, when they had so done: so that on every side the malice
of the Jews, succeeded and came to the glory of Christ, whose name they went
about utterly to destroy and abolish.

The.xx. Chapter.

ANd verily* the residue of the disciples, being stryken partly with fear,
and partly with despair, neglected the burying, and rought not for the dead
corpse. But certain weomen that were his disciples cared as much for it, as did
Joseph and Nicodemus, but the religion of the feastefull d^ye, stayed them from
the labouryng about preparacio^ of sweet odours. Howbeit, as soon as Phase
Sabbath day was past (the oyntmentes being made ready in the night Mary
Magdalene came earlye when it was yet somewhat dark unto the sepulcher, the
morrow after the Sabbath day. And when she saw the stone (wherewith the
entry of the sepulcher was closed up) removed thence, and the sepulcher to be
open, the woman supposed nothing else but that the dead corpse had been taken
away in the night, to the intent it might have been more semely and
accordyngly buried. For the body was laid there for a time, a^ of purpose,
that it might soon after be adourned and set forth with the due and full
solemnity of burying. For in deed the hope of his resurreccion fell away from
all the disciples, they were so much astonished with the certainty of his death.

Therefore Marie ere she had looked into the grave, They have taken away the
lord. etc.
retyered back again, and ran to Simon Peter, with whom was even that
disciple whom Jesus loved, and she says: Our lord is taken away out of the
sepulcher, and I know not whither they have carried him that took him a way.
They both being styrred with that voice, went forth. Surely they had small
hope, yet had they a great affeccion and desire toward their master, whom
they so much loved. And therefore they ran both out together to the grave,
but that disciple which was so beloved of Jesus, outranne Peter, and came first
to the sepulcher. And when he found the door open, he went not in, but
stouped down and looked into the grave, whether it were empty or no. And he
saw well there was no dead corpse, but the linen clothes left imbrued with
sweet odoriferous ointementes, wherewith the body had been wrapped, and also the
napkyn that Jesus head had been bound in, not the linen clothes and it lying
together, but wrapped up and laid aside by it self, so that it was easy to
perceive, that the body was not taken away by thieves, which would have
rather purloyned the whole corpse as it lay, wrapped and wound up with the
sweet smellyng spices, with the linen clothes, and the fine kercher: though it
had not been for the valor thereof, at least they would so have done, because
they should have lacked laisure to have separate the oyntmentes and sweet
spices from the body, seeing they cleaued as fast thereunto as byrdelime would
have done, and because also they should not have had sufficient time to fold
up and couche every thing hand: somely and severally in his place. This (such
as it was) was in deed the first comfort and hope that was given to them of
his resurreccion.

Now than anon after cummeth Peter also, who after that he was certified of the
thing by John, as he was slower in running, so was he both bolder and more
diligent in trying out the truth of the thing. For not being content with
lokyng into the grave, he also went into it. The other disciple a loker in as
well as he, (which yet durst not by himself alone go in, howebeit in deed his
companion being with him, took part of the fear away) now followed Peter
into the sepulcher. And so now they saw certainly at very hand the thing to
be true, (which the one of them had seen as it had been a shadow, or a
glymmering sight thereof,) that no corse or dead corpse was any where in that
place: but in deed they saw the clothes wherein the body had been wrapped, in
such sort pulled of, and laid aside, that it appeared to be done not of
thieves in have, sleyghtly and shuffled up, but quietly and layserly. Howbeit as
yet they did not believe that he was risen again to life, they only believed
that to be true, which Marie had told them: Verelye that the corpse was taken
away out of the sepulcher. For although they had heard Jesus say that he
would rise again, yet did not the saying stick inwardly in their minds, and
though some hope thereof were in their hertes, yet that which had already place
in their minds, the fear and tumulte of the cross and his passion, drove it
out of their minds. For they did not fully understand as yet, the saying of
the Prophet, which had prophesied that certainly Jesus should suffer death, and
rise again the third day from death to life.

Therefore the two disciples departed thence, and went back again to the
place from whence they came. But Marie of a certain excedyng love and
wonderful desire that she had to the lord, could not be drawn from the
sepulcher: sekyng him that was now dead, whom she had loved being alive, and
was desirouse to show gentilnes, and to do service upon the dead body,
forsomuche as she now could not have the fruicion of his lively body: and she
stood without nigh unto the door of the grave, and did naught else but all to
weep, and look about her, if she could have any hope or lykelyhoode to find
the body. Now than as she was weping, and in deed durst not go into the
grave, she turned her head aside and looked into the grave, and she saw two
angels, goodly to look too, both of good semblaunce and in pleasant white
apparel, sittyng in several places, the one at the head and the other at the
feet of the place, where the dead corpse was laid. And in very deed this
pleasant, this chereful and peaceable sight, did somedeale assuage the extreme
fear of the night, and of her carfulness. The angels also to comfort her
sorrowful pensifenesse, of their own accord and gentleness, speak unto the
weeping woman and say: O woman, what is it thou wepest for? She than being all
rauyshed, and as one drounke with a certain vehemency of love, says: They
have taken away my lord, and I know not where they have laid him. She
calls him her lord, and she also loves him being dead, having yet no hope
of the resurreccion. She was only herewithall grieved, that is, because she
could not have the sight of his body.

Whiles she speaks thus, she coniectured by the semblaunce of the angels,
that some man stood behind at her back, and not tarying for the angels
answer, she cast her iye aside, and incontinently she saw Jesus standing,
whom y^ angels had wurshipped, but yet Marie knew not that it was Jesus. For
he did appear in the form of a poor simple man lest he being suddenly seen in
his own fo^me and shape, should have much astonished the woman. Therefore to
bolden her withal, he calls and speaks gently unto her with the same faier
words that the angels did, saying: Woman, why wepest thou? whom sekest thou
loking about the hither and thither? She suspecting him to be a gardener, the
workman and keeper of the ground, wherein the sepulcher was, (for it was in a
garden) with a womanly simplicity said unto him: Sir, if thou have taken him
away, tell me where thou have hid him, that I may go fetch him thence. For she
supposed that some friend for fear of the Jews, had procured the body to be
secretly carried away, lest it should come into the Jews hands, and should
be otherwise handled than she would it should be. Jesus therefore being
delited in the great desire of the woman, does now with a known familier
voice, speak unto her, and calls her Marie. At this known voice, the woman
suddenly turnyng herself (for even at this very present she had bowed down
herself again toward the angels, so much was she by sudden mocions of
mind stiered to look this way and that way) the woman I say, knew Jesus,
and ravished with a sudden joy, she a disciple, speaks to the master, and
calls him Rabboni, which word in the Syrians tongue, signifies, Master: And
withal she falls flat down to the ground, and would have kissed his
feet, having yet in remembrance their old familiarity. But Jesus knowing
that as yet she thought no great excellent thing of him, although she loved
him sincerely and ardently, did prohibit her to touch his body. For Marie
saw well that he was alive again, but she thought yt he was revived for none
other cause, but as he did before, to live familiarlye with his friends, being
now a man alive, where as before he was dead: and ignorant she was that he now
carried about with him an immortal body, which was to be handled with much
greater reverence, which body the Lord did never exhibit or present to the
wicked, nor suffered it to be handled of every man, to thentent he might little
by little, altogether withdraw them from the love of the body. Touch me not
(says he) it is the same body which hong upon the cross, but it is now
beautified and adourned with the glory of immortality. But truly thine
affeccion is yet somedeale carnal, because I have not yet ascended up to my
father, which thing once done, I shall send unto you the spirit that is the
comforter, and he shall make you perfect and wurthy to have the spiritual
fellowship of me.

In the mean time content thy self with that thou have seen me and heard me
speak, and specially now go thou to my brethren, which are through my death
comforteles, and forth with make them partakers with thee, of the joy and
comfort which thou haste received by the sight of me: and upon these my
words show them that to this end I am risen from death to life, even that
after I have tarried a certain days among them, I may leave the world, and
ascend up to my father, who is also your father, and the same is both your god
and mine, common to both. Let them therefore put away earthly affeccions and
rectify their minds, applying the same to spiritual and heavenly things.

Now than Mary did as he bad her, and returnyng again to the disciples, showed
them that she had seen the lord, and told them the things which he had
commanded to be made relacion of in his name: and this was done that they
should take right great comfort of that he now called them his brethren, and
prepare also their minds to the love and desire of eternal and heavenly
things, for as much as the present use of his body should not endure long
with them. After that with these and certain other apparicions the lord Jesus
had little by little lift up their minds to quickness of spirit, and to the
hope of the resurreccion already past, the self same day that was the morrow
after the sabbath day which next to followed the sabbath of Easter, when it
was night, and the disciples secretelye gathered together, which for fear of
the Jews durst not assemble together in the day time. Jesus went in to them
when the doors were shut, and standing in the mids in the sight of them all,
to take away al fear from them, he saluted them amiably and full gentlye,
saying with a voice well known unto them: Peace with you. And lest they
should suspect it to be a ghost or another body, he shows unto them the
printe of the nails in his hands, and the scarre of the wound which the
soldier had made in his side with a spear. With this salutacion and sight,
the faith of his disciples was confirmed, the sorrow taken away, and their
minds much recreate and made ioyouse. For Jesus had promised them before that
thus it should be, that within a short time he would see them again, and
after they had seen him, and their sorrow put away, that he would make their
hertes glad and merye. And therewithal he told them this also should follow,
that in the world they should have sorrow and heuinesse, but in him they should
have peace and quietness.

Then said Jesus to them again: Peace be unto you. As my father sent me, even
so send I you also* And when he had said these words, he brethed on them,
and says unto them: Whosoeuers sins ye remit, they are remitted unto the^,
and whosoeuers sins ye retain, they are retained. But Thomas one of the
twelve (which is called Didimus) was not with them when Jesus came. The other
disciples therefore said unto him: We have seen the lord. But he said unto
them: Except I see in his hands the printe of the uayles, and thruste my
hand into his side, I will not believe. Therefore to confirm the Apostles in
their joy and coumforte the more, he once again saluteth them with good luck
of peace, saying: Peace with you. And at the same time withal, he hiely
auctoriseth them, and commands the^ to preach the things which they had
seen, and says: As my father sent me, so do I send you. I have truly and
faithfully glorified my fathers name, and you agreyng among your selves, shall
with like truth and faithfulness preach my fathers name and mine. Prepare
your minds to this fu^ccion and office: for as much as I now that I have done
diligently the thing that I had in commission to do, go again to my father,
and from thence I shall send unto you more plenty and more power of the holy
ghost. In the mean while shall I also make you partakers of the holy ghost
according to your capacity: and even as he was thus speaking, he brethed on
them and gave them the spirit, with authority to forgive all men their sins
that would be joined to him by profession of the ghospel and by baptism, and
that would forthinke their former life, and be eftsoon amended where they
have erred. Whosoeuers sins ye remit (says he) they are remitted unto them,
and whosoeuers ye retain, they shall abide subject to their sins. When
these things were done, the residue of the disciples were assembled together,
Thomas only except, that than was absent: which name Thomas signifies in the
Greek tongue Didimus, and in the Latin Geminus, in English doubtefull. For he
was one of the twelve who^ the lord did specially and peculiarly choose to the
office of preaching the gospel. Therefore after that he was come in to them,
the disciples that could scant stand for joy, showed openly unto him that
they had seen the lord. Thomas supposyng them to be deceived and illuded by
some vision or spirit, denied to believe unless he might see him with his own
iyes: and not to believe his own iyes as sufficient witness, except he might
see withal the printe of the nails even fresh in his hands, yea and with
putting his own hands into Jesus side perceive by felyng, the wound that the
spear made. And truly, this incredulity of the Apostle, by the dispensacion
of God as he shall dispose, did much good to the confirmacion and
stablishement of our faith.

Therefore eight days after, when the Apostles met together again, by
stealthe, and at this time with the rest, Thomas was in coumpanye, which
hitherto would not believe that Christ was risen: the Lord came in to them
where they were, the gates being hard fast shut, and standing in the mids of
them, he saluted them after his usual and well known manner and facion,
saying: Peace with you. And turnyng him by and by to Thomas, whose unbelief he
knew, that was ignorant in nothing: which lack of belief, because Jesus
knew it came not as the phariseis infidelity did, that is, of malice, but of
man's infirmity, he vouched safe to heal it. He says thus to him: Thomas
(says he) forasmuch as it does not suffice the to have heard of many
(that I was risen to life again) which has seen me and heard me, except thy
senses might feale and perceive the same, bring hither thy finger and feel the
wounds of the nails, and see that I truly carye the very true marks
thereof. Put thy hand into my side and handle the wound which the spear
made, and hereafter be not unfaithful, and hard of belefe in other mattiers:
but after thou haste now seen this thing proved certainly true, which
persemed to thee incredible, see thou give faith to my promises, how
incredible soever they seem to the common sense and judgment of men. After
that Thomas had seen and felt, knowing both the face and accustomed voice of
the Lord, he than conceived a full faith, and spoke aloude: My Lord and my
God. For as he was more hard of belefe, so no body did more clearlye confess
Jesus to be God and man, for because the handlyng of the body which late before
hong dead upon the cross, witnessed that he which was risen to life again,
was a very man in deed: and the knowleage of hid secret things, proved well
his godhead.

So than of truth, Jesus did well accept and embrace Thomas his confession,
but yet withal he did reprove his hardness of belefe, saying: Thomas because
thou have seen me, heard me, and handled me, thou beleuest: but blessed shall
they be, which though they see not, will yet believe. Verily the Lord Jesus
declared unto his disciples, his divine power and godheade by many other tokens
which are not written in this book, but some things are reported and
declared by other Evangelists, and some things also were reported and told
by word of mouth: and even they were the tellers thereof, which both saw and
heard the things themselves. For to set out and write all things (which
would have been a work that for the greatness it could not have been
measured) was not cared for, but yet it was thought necessary to write of
some things, that thereby ye might come to the belief, that Jesus was the
son of God. Which thing if ye do in deed, ye shall have that full bliss,
and beatitude which our Lord Jesus promised to them that when they see not,
believe. For like as he suffered death and lives immortal, so shall ye also by
profession of his name in true faith, obtain eternal life.

The.xxi. Chapter.

ANd verily, to confirm more and more the faith of his disciples, Jesus often
times appeared unto them, and talked with them, sometime also eat meat in
their company: le^te any suspicion should setle in their minds that it was
but a delusion or some ghost, which they had seen, neither was he therwhiles
continuallye, for all that, present in their company as he was wont before his
death, nor so familiarly handled himself among them: nor yet was seen of all
men, because he had said before that he would appear to his and not to the
world, nor to his neither, but even when he list. For now immortality showed
a certain semblaunce full of majesty, that was to be had in reverence, to
thentent that their faith being full stayed and establyshed, he might withdraw
from them altogether the sight of the body, and spirituallye to be now amongst
his. And so now therefore he appeared and showed himself again to his
disciples, at ye deep lake called Tyberias. And he presented himself unto them
on this wise. The disciples, which before yt time kept themselves secret in
Jerusalem, to be in sauetie out of the Phariseis danger, repaired again into
Galile, and there was a good sort of the^ together, even no fewer tha^ Simon
Peter and Thomas, called Didimus, also Nathanael of Cana a city of Galile,
where Jesus turned water into wine. And besides these, ye two sons of zebedei
John and James ye greater, and with these was two other disciples.

Now than, because they lacked their Lords help, by whom they were woonte to
be fed of the mere fre bounteousnes of friends, Peter went in hand again
with his old faculty, to get his lyuinge with his own hands: lest he should
be burdenouse to any man, or to be fed by any others lyberalitie in idleness.
For then he might not preach, and he thought it was no right that he which
served not the gospel, should live of the gospel. Therefore in the twie
light, because they should have goen abroad upon their peril in the day,
Peter says: I go a fishyng. The rest than said unto him: We also will go a
fishing with the. And so going forth a doors togetherwarde, they entered into
the ship. And they fished all that night in vain. For they ga^e never one
fish, to the intent that way should be made for a miracle, and therewith as
in a mystery to be signified, that the labor of an Evangelist is all in
vain, unless Christ do prosper the man's endeavor.

But now when it waxed day, Jesus stood on the shore, but the dysciples knew
not it was he, partly for the distaunce that was between him and them, and
partly because it was scant day: also partly because the Lord would not
furthwith be known. Therefore Jesus spoke unto them from the shore, saying:
Children have ye any meat? They than, forasmuch as they knew not the Lord
by his voice, but supposed him to be some other manne which came to the sea to
bye fyshe, made answer that they had none that they could selle him, because
they had taken nothing. Jesus than to declare little and little who he was, said
unto them: Cast out the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall
find that ye could not hitherto.

They did as he bad them, for through werynesse of their vain labor, and of
a great desire to take some fyshe, they conceived some hope: byanby so great a
multitude of fyshes was taken, that the net was laden withal, and could
v^neth be drawn up to the boat: And wete ye well, this was even a
resemblaunce of the multitude of men, which afterward by the preaching of
the apostles, should be brought and joined to the church out of the whole
world of what language or country soever they were. By the novelty of the
thing, that disciple whom Jesus loved, was moved to be more attentyfe and to
mark the thing, and so knew Jesus. And incontinently aduertysed Peter (who
was altogether busye about drawing up the net) that it was the Lord,
which standing on the shore commanded to looce and cast out the net.
Peter, being always one man and like himself, did forget both the net and the
fish, and took his shyrte (for before he was naked) and could not abide but
sprang into the sea, and so came he first of all to the Lord. The other
disciples came to him by ship, for they were not very far of the shore, but
as it were two hundred cubits, and they altogetherward drew the net full
and laden with fyshe.

And when they were come to land, they saw upon the bancke hot coals and
fish laid thereon, and bread withal. Therefore Jesus commanded the^ also, to
bring of their fyshes which they now caught. Than Peter returned again to the
ship, and drew the net to land full of great fishes: in noumbre an hundred
and three and fyftie. This also made it seem the greater a miracle, that when
there was so great a multitude and that of great fishes, yet was not the net
broken in sundre with the weight thereof. The thing did represent the humble
church, and as to the world weak and narrow, yet such a thing as shall
embrace all the nations of the world, the Lord Jesus being the head and chief
governor thereof.

unto Simon Peter: Simon Ioanna love thou me more than these? He said unto
him: Yea Lord, thou know that I love thee. He says unto him: Feed my
lambs. Furthermore, to show a more certeintie that he was very manne and no
ghost, he therefore approuyng the verity of his body by being seen with men's
iyes, heard with their ears, and handled with hands, would also eat meat
with them. He therefore invited his disciples to the dinner which was there ready
for the^. The disciples sat down, but all whusht and spoke no words: for the
majesty of the immortal body took from them their accustomed boldness. In
deed they knew him to be the Lord, but now he appeared after a more high and
gloriouse sort, as one of great nobleness and excellency. Therefore none
durst ask him, who art thou? and yet of the very thing it self, they knew
him to be the Lord, although the show and semblaunce of his body was
changed. Jesus than came and took bread etc.
Jesus therefore came to the feast, and as his manner was, brake bread with his
own hands, and gave it to them, and fish likewise: by exau^ple and deed
teaching his, whom he had specially chosen to be shepeherdes of the church,
to feed his evangelical flock with holy doctrine. But yet such as himself
had taught them. And this is now the third time that Jesus appeared (certain
spaces between) to his disciples, for he was not in their company continually.
After dinner was done, the lord Jesus, in manner declaryng by word of mouth
the thing, which in his fact he signified, committed his sheep to Peter that
he should feed the^: but he first thrice required love of him, to the intent
he might power into the minds of his disciples, that no man is a fit
shepeherde of an evangelical flock, except he which bears such love
toward them that he is put in trust withal to keep, as Christ showed
himself to have toward his, for whom he bestowed his life. And he specially
spoke to Peter, utterly to put away the remembrance of his denying Christ,
and to notise that he should have the hiest and chief place in the ministry
of the gospel, that did pass other in excellency of charity toward the
flock of the Lord. And therefore, by him, whom Jesus knew to be of a more
feruente mind then the rest, he would express to all the Apostles and their
successors, a proof of a true and a perfect shepeherde. And in deed Peter is
wount at other times also to be as a mouth of the Apostles, and by him the
Lord would have it known and to be heard what the other also would openly
confess: For because, by the expressed voice of this man, the public
confession of the whole church did but a late time before, deserve a promise
of the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And in the same wise also, he than
would that by this man's voice, open confession should be made of most hye
charitable love toward him: to the entente that by this one man, the rest
should know what manner of men ought to be curates of the lords flock. Simon
Ioanna (says Jesus) love thou me more than these? The Lord did not ask
these things as ignoraunte that he was much loved of Peter, but he would
have inwardelye fastened in the hertes of his disciples, that most hye
charity toward Jesus, is needful to him that should take cure of the
Lords flock, for the which the Lord himself suffered death upon the cross.

But Peter now being come to more circumspeccion than he was wount to be of,
made no answer concerning how much the other loved the lord, because he
knew not fully other men's minds: for his own part and conscience, he
makes answer, whereof he is bold to make the Lord himself witness. How
much any other loves thee, (says he) I know not: Lord I love thee, and
thou ask me, that know I do love thee. Thou that know the secrets of
men's minds, art not ignoraunte that I love thee. Than says Jesus: If thou
love me as thou openly say, feed my lambs which I love most dearly,
and for whom I have spente my life: and show thy self such toward them, as
I have showed my self toward you. This shall be a proof of a perfect love
toward me.

The Lord Jesus asks him again even with like many words: Simon Ioanna,
love thou me? Peter answers him even with like noumbre of words: Lord I
love thee. Thy self know that I love thee. Than says Jesus again: if
thou love mein deed, feed my sheep, which are dear to me. The lord asked
Peter the third time: Simon Ioanna, love thou me? The lords askyng so often
repeted, cast Peter in a scruple and in a sorrow. For although he knew in his
own conscience, that he loved the Lord exceadyngly, yet because he had thryse
denied the Lord after he had so stoutely promised the contrary, it caused him
also to distruste himself. For Peter's fall into the denial of his lord,
turned him to good, and furthered his salvation, which fall taught him
humble so briete, and caused him to learn a new lesson, that is, not to put
to much trust and affiaunce in himself, such a pestilence to evangelical
godliness, as none can be more perniciouse and deadely then it. Therefore he
answers sincerely of truth, but timerouslye and very lowlye withal, and
where before he trusted to himself, he now puts all his affiaunce in him,
to whom only trust and affiaunce ought to be given, saying: Lord, why ask
thou me so often, seeing thou know al thing? Thy self know that I love
thee. Than said Jesus: therefore feed my sheep, and upon them declare how
much thou set by me.

Thou shalt take an exaumple of a good shepeherde of me. I have spente my life
for my sheep, thou likewise shalt play the faithful shepeherde of my sheep,
even to the loss of life and head. The sheep be mine whom I have redeemed with
my blood, and now returning again to my father, I commit and betake them to
thy fedyng. Thou therefore shall play the shepeherde and not the lord, and
thou shall feed to save, and not kill or pull of their skyn to their utter
undoing. If I be thrice dear and well-beloved of the, they shall be dearly
beloved of the, whom I love exceeding well. The lord Jesus would have these
things with so great diligence powered into the minds of his disciples,
because he knew there would rise men, that should, not for the love of Jesus,
but for their own commodities sake, take cure of christen people, or rather
invade and with violence take cure upon hand: which manner of persons would instead of shepeherdes, play the tyrauntes, and rob altogether. Moreover the
lord did vouchesafe to declare also what the three times repeted confession
of love, did mean. He that for the health and safety of the lords flock,
contemns his riches, cares not for worldly honor, and neglects his own
affeccions, shows great lykelyhoode, of truth, that he has a pure sincere
love: but he that for saving the flock, lets not to adventure his life, that
manne (ye wot well) has (so doing) given a most sure lesson of perfect love
and charity.

The Lord now willing somewhat to open that Peter in time to come, should do
that thing, said: Peter, I do well assure thee thereof, thou shall when time
is, perform and accomplish the thing which thou now say and co^fessest.
For truly it is no delicate profession. For when thou wast young, and in
bodily strength more able to suffer laboriouse and greuouse things, thou waste
more dayntely occupied and lived more at ease. For thou vngirdedst or gyrdedst
thy self at thine own will and pleasure, and walkedst at liberty whither
thou would. But when thou art old and than in bodily strength more
weaker, thou shall be more hardely entreated, thou than being in heart and
will more strong. For thou shall stretche furthe thy hands, and another shall
gyrde thee, and lead thee whither thou would not. By this riddle or
parable, Jesus signified by what kind of death Peter should once glorify
God. For because, being very aged, he was led to the cross, which though he
suffered gladlye for the excellent love that he bare toward his Lord, yet
the weakness of man's nature lothed it.

When Jesus had said thus, he begun to walk, and said to Peter, follow me:
so once again prouokyng and inuityng him to the following of his charity and
death: Follow (...) me.
When Peter turned and looked about him, he sees even that disciple whom
Jesus loved, and that leaned on the Lords breast at his last supper, whilst
he asked of him who should betraye him. Forasmuch as Peter did entierly love
this disciple, and knew that he was always better beloved of the lord then the
rest, and than saw the same unbidden follow, next unto Peter, Peter asked the
lord what should become of that man. For he now knew already of his own
death, and he desires to know whether that he should have this man a
companion to dye with him.

For he thought that to be a gloriouse thing unto him, and a great token of
the Lords love toward him, that he might dye after the exaumple of Jesus.
But Jesus to correct this unnecessary care that Peter had of an other man's
death, said: If I will have him tarry till I come, what is that to thee? He is
mine, and after mine advise will I ordeyne and determyne for him that shall be
for the best. Care and prepare thou for that which apperteyneth to thy self,
that is to say, that thou follow me. And than upon the occasion of this
saying, there arose a brute among the disciples that Jesus his well-beloved
disciple should dye no violent death, but should live still until the Lord
shall come again to judge the quick and the dead, (which they all thought
than should be sone after.) Albeit the Lord did not say, he shall not dye,
but to make dull, abate, and repulse Peter's curiosity, and ouermuche
diligence, he denied it to perteyne unto him, though his will and pleasure had
been, that the man should still live unto his last cummyng.

And in deed this is thatsame disciple that witnesses these things thus to
be dooen, and that wrote the same, to the entente they may more truly, and
more far abroad be scattered and dispersed to the knowledge of all folk.
And we have known that his testimony is true. For he wrote not other men's
hearynges, but at which himself was present. Nor he has not made mention of
all the things which Jesus said and did. For if a man should go about to
tell them, every thing by it self, an unmeasurable sort of books should be
made thereof. But so much is written as suffiseth to the obteyning of
salvation. Therefore the rest is, that beleuyng these, and stickyng to the
steps and ways of Jesus, we labor diligently to get the reward of
immortal life.

Thus ends the Paraphrase upon the Gospel of S. John.
To the most uertuous Lady Queen Kateryne late wife to King Henry the eight
of most famous memory deceassed, Nycolas Udall your graces most humble
orator, and servant, wysheth perpetual felicitee and joy in Jesus Christ

FOr as much as nothing does with like speed or with better effect either
open to the world or engraue in men's hearts the knowelage of Gods
commandments, and the rules of true christian doctrine, then devout and
godly tractises for the expoundyng and declaryng of holy scripture: how happy
and blyssed are we, and how greatly bound to thank God, that in these our
times there daily cum forth so many and the same so fruictfull and Godly
weorkes in our own tongue, to the ghostely coumfort and edifiyng of all devout
chrystian readers in the true fayeth and relygyon. For where in times past the
studyous writers of books were enforced with much high suite and service to
procure the favor and good will of princes or other estates, to whom to
dedicate such weorkes as they wrote, to thentent that under the name and
protection of such noble personages the said weorkes might be the better habled
to the readers, and the better accepted of the people: now do Kings,
Queen's, princes, and other piers (especyally here in England) of their own
mere mocions, and good zele, not only with their propense favor, and with
their benefycyall aid, coumforte, and lyberalitee, help forewarde the good
endeavor and sedulytee of studious writers, myndyng by their godly monumentes
to edify the feithfull congregation: but also are dylygent and peynefull,
both to put to their own hands to the endictyng and pennyng of many wholesome
traictises for that purpose, yea and ferther by their exaumple and prouocacion
to set other in hand with writing or translatyng, to the fructefull exercise
of the learned, to the wholesome enstruccion of English readers, and to the
effectual edifiyng of the simple ignorant multitude, if the same can be
content for their solle health to give ear and mind thereto. And among this
sort of public benefactours, your excellent highness, Queen Kateryne,
deserves no less then next after our soueraygne lord the kings maiestee,
who even now already at the first entreaunce of this his most noble reign,
and within the years of tender minoritee, does with the advice and consent of
the most prudent and the same his most dear uncle Edward duke of Somersette,
as well of his most royal person in the time of his mynorytee gouernoure, as
also of all his Maiestees realms, dominyons, and subjects Protector, together
with the assent and consent of the other his most honorable, most trusty,
and most feythfull Counsaillours, most forewardly, most earnestly, and with
all possible diligence labor day and night as well by most holso^, laws, as
also by O^^elyes of most pure doctrine, and by true preachers to refourme
abuses, to sow abroad the word of God, and to plant true relygyon in all
parts of his realms and domynons, your highness (I say) next unto these
twoe, deserves no less then to be esteemed and called the chief patroness:
not only for diverse most godly Psalms and meditacions of your own penning
and setting forth: but also for procuryng this present weorke of Erasmus
Paraphrases to be translated to the use of the unlearned multitude, which can
go no ferther then the understanding or readyng of English. For in this
Paraphrase of Erasmus is contained in manner a whole library of devout and
catholyke expositours upon the whole new testamente, in which new testament is
contained the plenteous richesse and most precious treasoures of Christ's
gospel, that is, of the glad news of Gods favor and mercy toward
mankind. Which favor and mercy of God whosoever does feithfully and syncerely
enbrace, cannot but favor and ferther the setting forth of scripture in the
vulgar language, that al folks may know it, and also of any other godly
traictises whereby that same general benefyte of God toward mankind, may
the more clerelye and certainly be perceived. And to this effect forasmuch as
Desiderius Erasmus of Roterodam does especially direct as well these his
Paraphrases upon the new testament, as also all other his right christian
wrytinges, and that with as much indifferency as is possible to be: I cannot
but judge, that whosoever are prompte and hasty condemners of Erasmus, or eagre
adversaries unto his doctrine: do under the name and color of Erasmus rather
utter their stomach and hatred against Gods word and the grace of the
gospel, which Erasmus for his part most diligently and most simply
labors to bring to light. His doctrine (will some vneguall judges say) is
scarcely sincere. If there shall no more insynceritee of doctrine appear in the
wrytynges of them that so will say, then the common consent of the chrystian
world does find and judge in Erasmus: I doubt not but their weorkes shall be
of all good people approved, desired, enbraced and followed. Erasmus (will some
such headie persons say) does somewhere err. It may so be forasmuch as a man
he is, and so estemeth himself, and would his weorkes none other wise to be
read or accepted then the wrytynges of other mortal men. But in case he
should in some place say now and then a word to much or to litel, or put a
wurse word for a more apt term, or if he should in some place stoumble or
swerve (which poincte of humayne frayltee the best doctors that wrote sense
the apostles time has not escaped, nor Erasmus so stands in his own
wylfull opynion, but that being found and tried a fault, he would have been
as ready to retracte it, as ever any other godly and catholic writer has been:) yet were one little tryppe (after my poor judgment) among so many
notable good works for the enterpretacion of scripture, and for the help of
the simple, rather to be borne withal, then so many good things to be either
rejected or kept away from the hungry christian readers. it is, a cold
charitee that can bear with nothing: and an eagre malice it is that for a
trifle or a matier of nothing would have the ignorant multitude to lack so
much good edifying as may be taken of Erasmus, as well in all his other right
devout and catholyke works, as also most specially in these his
paraphrases, in which he labors so to enlarge the process and tenor of the
text, as the sense thereof may both euedentlye be gathered, and may well hang
together. Erasmus therefore like as he has by a paraphrasticall discourse
plainly set forth the ghospelles of the four Evangelists afore^so does
he now here expoune the second part of Lukes ghospel, entitled ye Acts of
the Apostles, which work Athanasius (at least wy^e if it were Athanasius in
deed, that wrote the little traictise entitled of the books of both the old
and the new testament. etc.) testifies, that Luke wrote out of Peturs mouth*
and that Petur endicted unto Luke what and how he should write the^, as Paul
endicted to ye same Luke when he wrote his gospel. Whereof (as Erasmus in the
preface to his paraphrase upon Lukes ghospel records) it is gathered and
thought, that the said Acts were written in Rome. But whersoeuer they were
written, certes the work was no less expediente and necessary to be written,
ne the paraphrase upon the same any thing less requisite to be translated
into Englysh, then the rest of the new testament: first for that it is a
plain historical narracion and a piece of the very ghospel, in that it
declares as well the ascencion of Christ from yearthe up into heaven, as also
his sendyng ^oune of the holy ghost from his heavenly father together with the
spryngyng up of the prymatiue church, and the form and order of preaching
that the Apostles than first begone with: secondely because it was (as Erasmus
himself testifies) the last part that he did of all the whole paraphrases
upon the testament, and by reason thereof (as I judge) the most absolute piece
of work and best dooen of the rest, by reason of his long exercise before in
this kind of writing: and thyrdely because this piece of the new testament is
no less profitable for the publishyng and furtheraunce of the ghospel, then
Luke did devise and entende it, ne to the poor younglynges in Christ's
dyscipline any thing less auaillable. For here may we learn the beginninges
of Christ's church, by whom and by what manier persons the feythe of Christ
first sprung up, how it proceeded and grew, how it was persecuted, and how
by persecucyon it wexed stronger and stronger. For as the Paulme tree the more
weight and burden is laid upon it, the more it arises and shootheth vpryght:
so the ghospel the more persecucion that was inflycted unto it, and the more
rigor, wrong* reproach, cheynes, and aduersytee that was mynistred unto it,
the more it grew, ye more it prospered, the better it went forewarde, and the
more it floryshed. In the Acts is to be read by what means and dryftes of
humayne polycy the enemies of Christ's blood and gospel wrastled to
suppress the glory of his cross, and how the more that the wysedo^ of the
world thought to euacuate the fruicte of Christ's death and passion, the more
did the humylytee of preaching the Cross, work in the hearts of y^ simple to
contemn not only the pleasures and flattery of the world, but also the
persecucion and tyranny thereof, so that daily increased in every place where
the gospel was preached, thousands upon thousands to augmente ye feithfull
congregation. The Acts therefore were no less necessary to be translated then
the rest of the paraphrases, which Acts I have by occasion of adding,
digesting, and sorting the text with the paraphrase thoroughly perused, and
conferryng the same with the Latin I have here and there dooen my good will
and diligence to make the Englysh aunswerable to the Latyne book, at lestwyse
in sense: as by the same occasion I did also with Mathewe. In John I have in
manier dooen nothing at all saving only placed the text, and divided the
paraphrase, because I knew the translatours thereof, with whose erquysite
doings I might not without the crime of great arrogancy and presumpcion be
busy to entremedle. Most humbly therefore beseching your highness most
gracious Lady, in good part to take my good zele and diligence, and in case
any thing shall not suffyciently answer your mind or desire, the same to
impute rather to the lack of facultee and knowlage, then to any default of
good will in me: I shall here without any ferther circu^staunce of words,
commend and leave this whole work to the diligent readyng and following of all
the devout English congregacyon: and with most hertye prayer beseech almighty
God long years to preserve and co^tynewe the prosperous estate of your
highness, to the end that by your good help and means the devout people that
are willing and foreward to learn and to live Christianlye, may receive many
like godly weorkes and fruictful traictises, to their continual ghostly
profit, coumfort, and edifying in the same our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom
with the father, and with the holy ghost be al laud, honor, and glory, both
in heaven and earth for ever and ever. Amen.

The Acts of the Apostles.
The.i. Chapter.

Now have I accomplished the one half of my promise, dear friend Theophilus,
forasmuch as I comprised in my former treatise, ye life of Jesus Christ, more
groundly rehersyng the history, then other yt write thereof, yt is to we^e even
from the time that John Baptist, which was the foremessagier of the Lord, was
conceived, because ye in this same rehearsal, certain prophecies were also
disclosed, affirmi^g by expressed words of promise, yt Messiah should sone
after come. This done, sum things have I rehearsed more at large which of the
other writers were left untouched, as of Christ's conception, of his birth,
of his circumcision, and of the purificacyon of Marye, somewhat also I touched
of his godly towardnes whereof he showed a proof and toke^ being but xii. years
old. These things thought I for that cause worthy to be recited, ye by many
tokens it might be evident, that this was he, whom the prophecies had
notablye spoken of, and that even the tender youth of Jesus lacked not
witness of good men, and of those which were inspired with the holy ghost.
And though it be not to be doubted but ye Jesus whole trade of life, was an
excellent example of perfect holiness, yet those things omitted which were
done in the mean space, we passed over until that time, that John by his
preaching and baptisyng, began to show himself the foremessagier of Christ,
forasmuch as our lord Jesus began from that time forward, chieflye to be
occupied about the health of man's soul, accordyngly as it was contained in
the figures and dark sayings of Moses law, and in the foreshewinges of the
prophets. All which his busye endeavor, rests in these two points: in
deeds, that is as much to say, as in workynge of miracles, sufferyng pains
of the cross, and in resurrection, wher^in he left none of al those things
undone, that either by shadows of the law were signified, or spoken of before
by the prophets: and in words, by mean whereof he taught a new kind of
philosophy, and a joyful, so that we might both learn of him, and take
example to live a godly life. All these things have I treated of in order,
even unto that day, that he was received into heaven from whence he came,
after he had arisen from death to life, and commanded his.xii. Apostles, and
other his disciples to the number of threscore and.x. who^e he had specially
chosen, to the end that they, when they had received the holy ghost (whom he
even than breathyng in the very face of them endued them with, and afterward
sent the same from heaven more aboundauntlye,) should go through all the
world, and preach this gospel, not to the Jews only, but unto all manner
nations of the world. And first of all it was expedient, that they, by whom he
had purposed to bring all men in belefe of his wonderful acts: should be
thoroughly confyrmed in faith themselves. The chyefe point among the rest, was
this, that all men should be fully persuaded, that Jesus was in veraye deed
dead, and that he verayly arose from death to life the third day, not with a
fantastical body, but with the very same, being now immortal, which he
before time had carried on yearthe, subject to death, and which had been
laid void of life, To whom also he showed him self alive after his passon.
in the grave.

For this cause thought he it not sufficient, once only to show him self to
his disciples, after he had arisen from death to life, but often times appeared
he to them, not like as ghostes are wont to appear, but in sundrywyse
declaryng by evident tokens to them, that he had taken unto him his lively
body again: fowerty days tarried he with them on earth, for the same, cause
purposely, yet of all this time would not he be seen of any, but of his own
disciples. And not only his pleasure was to be seen of them, heard, and
felt, but also familiarely he eat and drank with them, which is the most
evident token that may be of a lively body. And in the mean space, he often
commoned with them of the kingdom of god, puttyng them in mind of those
things, which he had done and taught before his death, that they might
finally perceive, that every thing was cumme to pass, which he said should
cumme, warning them farther, what they from thence forth should either do, or
awayte for. For though he had already given them authorytee to preach the
gospel, And commanded them, that they should not depart from Jerusalem.
etc.
yet forbade he them, they should not hastily set upon the exercise of so
weighty a matier, and that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but that
they assembled there, and together applying themselves each with other to
fasting, giving lauds to God, and praying, should awayt for the cummi^g of the
holy ghost, whom he before his death, had promised that his father should
send, to be an other comfortour to them. I (said he) promised with mine own
mouth, and doubt not ye but my father will see the same unfeignedly
performed, that I have promised you in his name. For his will and mine be
both one. Thentrepryse that ye shall take in hand, is of heaven, and of no
yearthely man's inuencyon: ye shall not teach carnal things, as the
Phariseis have done hitherto, but ghostely things: and great trouble shall ye
have for preaching of my gospel. Wherefore it is necessary that ye be
stre^gthed with power from heaven, that ye may be hable to sustain so
chargefull an entrepryse, that shall not be brought to pass by man's policy,
but by help of the holy ghost.

For John truly baptized with water.
For those things that have been hitherto done, are but as rules, instruccions
and princyples for young begynners, in respect of setting forward ye gospel.
As that John Baptized with water, but the holy ghost gave he not, for it
passes man's power to give him, and nothing else preached he, but ye man
should repent, and that the kingdom of heaven was at hand.

Now must ye have stronger mayntenaunce to set forth the lyuelye doctrine
of the gospel, and to bear of the assaults of the world, which shall
strive against it. To bring that about it is not sufficient that y^ be void
of sin, but ye have need of a new spirit to the setting forth of this new
kind of lerning, a plenteous spirit, yt shall abou^dantly assist you, an
heavenly spirit, and a spirit like fire: in who^ ye shall be christened within
few days. This is the baptism, yt John could not give, but prophesied that I
should give it: For thus said he, in bearyng witness of me: he shall christen
you (said he) with the holy ghost and fire. In times past also god endewed
his Prophets, and other holy men, with his spirit. And I have brethed my holy
spirit on you. It is even the very same spirit, but now shall he most
plenteously be powered ouerall the whole world, and shall renew all things.
Against his cummyng, make your selves ready with fasting and prayer, but
specially with full trust and confydence, that ye may be fytte instruments
for him to spread abroad his heavenly power.

After Jesus had spoken these words unto his disciples, being assembled into
one place, When they therefore were cu^ together, they asked of hi^, saying:
Lord. etc.
because he would have no variaunce left among them, at his departing (for
even to that hour they had not yet put out of their heads their
fantastical dream, of the kingdom of Israel, to be advanced and enlarged
by him) they inquired of the Lord, as he was even ready straight ways to
depart, whether that as soon as he had sent down the holy ghost, he would
restore his people of Israel to their worldelye kingdom again, and whether
he would immediatlye appear before the face of the woorlde in his majesty.
For they had not yet conceived what manner a thing this ghostely kingdom
should be. Peter would have had him establyshe a kingdom when he was on the
hille. The rest also of thapostles, what time mention was made of rysyng from
death to life, enquired of his kingdom, and now eftsoon upon that
communicacion which they had heard, of sending down the holy ghost, they
came to remembrance of a temporal kingdom. For they trusted that it should
cum to pass, that the Jews should be rewlers over all the world. And in
very deed sure it was to cum, that Israel should reign, not that fleashly
Israel, but he that truly had deserved this name, that is to say, he that
in deed were strong in God. For Jacob deserved well to have that name when he
wrastled with thaungell. As long as the worldly manne trusted to his own
deserts, he was not hable to satisfye the Justice of god. For all the world
for sin was reproved, and subdued unto punishment. But after that manne began
to mystruste his own works, and to stick unto the promyses of the gospel,
he did as a man would say, ouercum the justice of god, and by force obtained
mercy. This kingdom being decayed in every place, but specially among the
Jews, Christ restored through his gospel. The disciples not understanding
this, phansied with them selfs that sum good chance would cum, which
should deliver them from all persecucion of the wicked. But as for that was
not to be looked for before the end of the world. Which time the lord would
not have them to know, because it was not expediente for them to know it.
And therefore when they curyouslye demanded it, he put them to silence with
this answer: Enquire not of those things, which are not expediente for you to
know. Only believe steadfastly, and do that ye are commanded. Ye shall be but
ministers in this matier. Leave the procedynges herin, and the end of the
same, to my heavenly father. And he said unto the^: It is not for you. etc.
It is not therefore your part to know, what year, what month, or what
hour, that kingdom of Israel shall cum, which things ye folysh Calkers
curiously seek for. As much as my fathers pleasure was, yt you should know I
have told you, but that time have I not uttered unto you, because my father
reteineth to himself the knowleage thereof, to this end, that ye be diligent
in doing your duties. The kingdom of god shall cum finally, whereas both the
good and the bad shall be rewarded according to their deserts, against whose
cummyng must ye be always ready. Albeit this spiritual kingdom shall in the
mean season also appear, in setting forth whereof, god shall use your help,
but as for rewardyng you therefore let him alone with that. Wherefore, setting
aparte your desire to know those matters which ye ought not to know, make
ready your selves to that that is at hand. To the which thing, because ye of
your own ability are not sufficient, the holy ghost, according to my
promise, shall be powered on you from heaven, to augment your strength of mind,
and to bring into your remembrance again whatsoever I have heretofore
taught you, and farther to put in your minds, whatsoever thing else it shall
behoue you to know. And so shall ye, being taught by his instruction, and
strengthed with his aid, bear witness of me, first at Jerusalem according
to the saying of the prophet, out of Syon shall the law proceed, and the word
of the lord out of Jerusalem: and sone after, throughout all Iewry, next
throughout Samaria, which is nygh adjoining to Iewry, and finally through al
countries in the world, where ever any dwelling of man is. For I came
indifferently for all men's sakes. I died for every man, and each man has the
gracious favor of my gospel proffered him. Hitherto the law has reigned only
among the Jews, but my father will have his gospel to reign, as far abroad
as the world is open or wide.

These were the last words, that our lord Jesus spoke to all his disciples
being gathered together into one place at Bethany: After which words when he
had blessed them, in sight of them al, carried he was up on high so long, until
that a bright cloud took the body of him clean out of sight. For tha^ was it
full time for them to trust no longer unto his bodily presence, that they
might were the more spiritual, and might behold Jesus none otherwise than with
the iyes of their faith. And for this cause, when Jesus was taken up on high,
And while they looked stedfastiye up toward heaven, behold, etc.
the disciples stood with their iyes steadfastly fyxed toward heaven. So hard a
thing was it to pull them from him, who^ they loved excedyngly, though being yet
but weak. They looked also, whether that any miracle should be showed them from
above. Therefore suddenly two messagers from heaven appeared in man's likeness
in white garments, the very form caused them not to fear: the bryghtnesse
of their garments, was convenient for the messengers of him, that than
hastened to his glory. These two did with friendly words assuage the disciples
sorrow, that they had conceived by the departure of their lord, and called them
back again from their gasing up, which profited them nothing unto their
vocacion, saying: ye men of Galile, why stand ye here loking up toward
heaven? This same Jesus, which is now taken from you to heaven, is returned
whence he came, as ye have often heard of him, that he came from his father,
and that he would, leauyng you in the world, return to his father again. He
is not taken up into the air as Helyas was, but he is received into his
fathers Palayce, and there shall sit at his right hand as partener of the
kingdom of heaven. You saw him going to heaven, with a visible body, and yet
immortal. And likewise in time to cum shall he return, that they which would
not whiles he was here, knowledge him to be their savior, shall than feel him
to be a judge. He shall not cum again to you poorly, but from on high shall he
show himself to the iyes of al men with great glory. But a few of you saw
him going up, but every manne shall see him at his second coming. Albeit ye
must not look for him immediately to return. He himself showed you that the
gospel of god should first be preached throughout the world. Now therefore
endeavor youreselues rather to do that. For ye were not bidden tarry here, but
to continue at Jerusalem, to the end that after ye have there received the
holy ghost, ye may luckely take in hand this heavenly business.

The disciples than obeyed these words, and departing from the mount, called
Olyuete, which our lord before his death was so delyted with, that veraye
often he resorted unto it, and upon the which he last (also) stood when he
was ready to return unto heaven, repaired to Jerusalem. That hyl is from
Jerusalem as far as it were a lawful journey on the Sabbath day, that is to
say, almost two miles. From this hill went he to suffer that shameful death
of the cross, and from thence likewise he went to glory: within the sight of
this hill is Jerusalem situate, and sittyng thereupon had he Prophesied with
weping teres the distruccion of the same City. In this city which was a
murderer of the prophets, the lord willed first the light of the gospel to
sprede, partly for because it was so foresaid by prophets, and partly that
they should have no pretexte ne cloak left them for their excuse which
otherwise through their own infidelity would utterly have perished.
Chapostles were more desirous to look upward to heaven, whither their lord
went before them, but we for profit of our neighbor must often come down to
things, which be rather necessary then pleasant. When they came to
Jerusalem, they went up into a certain parlour, They went up into a parlour.
where those discyples abode, that were among the rest, most famylyar with
Christ: that is to say, Simon Peter and John, James and Andrewe, Philippe and
Thomas, Bartholomewe and Mathewe, James the soonne of Alpheus, and Simon
zelotes, which in Hebrewe was called Cananeus, and Judas, by surname called
Thadeus, or Lebbeus, brother to James the younger. Certain women besides
tarryed in the same parloure, which of a devout love followed the Lord in his
way rydyng to Jerusalem, and had served him with their goods. Among those
was also Marye the mother of Jesus with certain other his kyns^olkes, whom
the Hebrews called his brethren. Mark me here a little the beginning of the
church, which was than as young borne. They were delyted with the city
Jerusalem, which signifies with the Hebrews, the sight of peace. But such
that take this world for their country, dwell not in Jerusalem neither
attain they to the quietness of an heavenly life. Neither they that have their
minds troubled with worldly desires, dwell in Jerusalem. The holy ghost
cutteth not into such hertes. They were also delited to be in a parloure,
which is an high place of the house. For shoppes, or work houses are wont to
occupye the lower parts of houses. But he that makes himself ready to be a
dwelling place for the holy ghost must be utterly void of all vile cares. This
is that holy congregation, which our Lord Jesus chose among all others.
This parlour was the first house wherein that godly church dwelled. Now mark
what was here done. They spent not the time in brablyng or in idle tales, but
continued all together of one mind in holy prayer. Christ's church is not
there, where is not agreement and concord. Their prayers God accepts not,
which love not brotherly. Neither is he woorthye to be heard, ye prays not
instantly. The holy congregation prays al one thing. Where one prays for
riches, an other wishes the death of his enemy, an other for long life,
another for promocion, an other an other thing, there is no prayer mete for
Christ's congregation. The rest also of the disciples, resorted to the parlour
where thapostles were. And whosoever will be accoumpted Jesus disciple, must
flock to the company of the church. Now was there of people gathered
together about the number of an hundred and twenty. So few of them there were
that loved Christ with all their hearts.

Here began Peter, as it full well besemed a faithful shepeherd that earnestly
wished for thincrease of Christ's flock, to be sumwhat careful that thapostles
whom his master Jesus had chosen twelve in noumber, were diminished. For by
reason of ye death of Judas Iscarioth, of twelve there remained but eleue^.
Mark me here, o Theophilus, the manner, that the church than used in their
consultacyon. A great multitude of disciples being present, Peter
representing the person of a bishop, stood up in the mids where the disciples
were sittyng: to the intent that sum decree with each man's consent, might be
stablished, that should seem convenient to make up thapostolike order again.
His beginning was of holy scriptures. For thence must a sermon be taken, yt is
worthy to be spoken of a man of the church, neither was any thing here with
them determined, before they all had made with one assent their prayers. His
words were these: Brethren, ye ought not to attempt any new matter by man's
polycie or persuasion, but what was spoken of long sythens of the holy ghost by
the mouth of David, as touching putting in of some man to supplye the room of
Judas, must needs be fulfilled. For this was David's prophecye in his Psalms,
how it should come to pass, that Judas in swaruynge from his lord, should
make room for a another to succeed him. For our lord Jesus among all other had
chosen specially twelve, whom he would have to bear witness of all that he
did and taught. Ye see them all here present except Judas Iscarioth. And him
also had the lord chosen into the number of the twelve, and would that he
should be partaker of the Apostles office. But he had rather chose to cast of
his Lords company and ours, and to be a guide unto sinful soldiers, which
took Jesus, than to follow his captain Jesus, or to be fellow with
thapostles. But of his wicked purpose came an evil end. For couetousenes so
blinded him, that he sold and betrayed his lord, which was giltlesse, for
thirty plates of silver. Afterward repenting his fault, And when he was
hanged, he burst a sunder. etc.
brought he in again thungodly money, and cast it before the priests feet,
of whom he had been hired. And having more in mind his mischeuous deed, than
the mercy of Jesus, he wroughte his own death. For he hanged himself: and
as he hong, his bealye brake, and all his bowelles fell out. But as for that
unlucky money, which he had cast at the priests feet, was by counsel of
them contributed to byinge of a field, wherein strangers might be buried,
because they thought it unmeet, to lay up the price of an innocents blood in
their treasurye house. This detestable scrupulositie of the priests and
Phariseis, caused that both Judas wicked act, and their own ungodliness,
was the better known with all that were dwelling at Jerusalem. Insomuche as
that field was called among the Jews Acheldama, which is as much to say, as
a field of blood. So that now we see it fulfilled in Judas, which the holy
ghost in the.lxviii. psalm had prophesied before should cum unto the Jews,
that with mortal envy pursued Christ, and would not repent being entyced by
so many benefits, which shall be accomplished in the other also, when the time
cummeth. For this is the prophecy: let their dwelling place be solytarye, and
no man remain to dwell in it. Unhappy Judas has lost his room. In time to
cum also the temple shall be destroyed the priestehod, the Scribes and
Phariseis authority, with the city Jerusalem shall perish. The cruel Jews
shall be thruste out, and in their places shall true Jews enter, which being
circumcysed in mind, not in body, shall knowledge Messiah whom they
crucified. This also was showed before by many foreprophecies, and we our
selves have heard of our Lord Jesus when he prophesied with weeping tears,
that these things should betide the city Jerusalem.

Wherefore now it remains for our parts to see, And no man dwelling therein.
etc.
that some manne be chosen into Judas towme. For this is meaned by the
prophecy of the hundred and eight psalm: let an other take his bisshopryke.
For our office is nothing else, but that in taking cure of the lords flock,
we provide the^ food out of the doctrine of the gospel. He left his place,
and yet ought not the flock to be defeated of their shepeherdes, nor that
noumbre of them to be diminished, which our lord did first ordeyne, giving
them a special name, that they should be called Apostles. For his pleasure
was to have them always for witnesses of his words and deeds, whom he had
for the same purpose continually with him in householde and company: wherefore
one must we chose into Judas town, of those that has been conuersaunte with
us all that while, that our lord Jesus being busied about the health of man's
soul, willed us to be in company with him, and still to go with him, whither
ever he went (that is to say, from the baptism of John, after which he
straightwayes came, unto that day that he went up to heaven,) to the intent he
may be a sufficient witness with us of all things that our lord taught and
wrought, but especially of his resurreccion: for he appeared not often unto all
his disciples, but to those only, whom he had specially chosen.

The multitude approving these sayings, appointed two chosen out of the number
of.lxx. disciples. Joseph, otherwise named Barsabas, (which also for his
upright living was called Just) and Matthias, yt of these two which were of
like godliness, he whom the cumpanie liked better of the twain should take upon
him thoffice of an apostle. And when they prayed they said. etc.
But they mystrusting their own judgments, prayed to god with one voice,
saying: Men that judge of things that they see and hear, may be deceived, and
fail in their judgment, but thou lord, which only lokest on the heart,
whereby man is in deed either good or bad, vouchesafe thou to show us thy
servants by sum token, whether of these two persons thou have chosen to make
up ye number of.xii. apostles, and to cum to ye exercisyng of such an office,
whence Judas fell, to go to that place whereunto it was not unknown to the, who
see al things, that he should go. For neither was it long of the that he
forsook thy company, which dyddest what might be done, to call him to
repentance, neither were thou deceived in judgment when thou did admit
him, that should sone after shrink from the, but thy heavenly wisdom saw
that it was expedient so for us, that through his treason, thy son should be
sacrificed for us, and that we should take example by such a traitoure, what
danger it were for us negligently and recheles to execute thoffice, which we
take in hand. After this prayer they cast their lottes according to the
custom of the Hebrews. And they gave forth their lottes
For so was Jonas by lot cast into the sea, so Ionathas was perceived to have
tasted of the honey, so likewise the priests did execute their holy misteryes
by lottes.

For the holy ghost was not yet cum down, and thapostles smelled still of
certain Jewish manners. Albeit there was no danger in drawing lottes, for
which soever of them were chosen, was a good man, and mete for the office. And
yet was not the whole matter committed to lottes. For two of the most approved
persons were first chosen by voices. And because they were in doubt whether
of those two they might take, lots decided the doubtefulnesse which could not
be rashely done, forasmuch as it was ruled by prayer.

Than this lot, which was nothing else but an opening of the will of god, chose
Matthias, whereas Joseph, besides the commendacion he had as appeared by his
name, was also kin unto Jesus. And yet Matthias was preferred, because it
should be a lesson to us, that in chosing of bishops, to whose credit the
dispensacion of the gospel must be committed, we must so utterly forbear to
leave unto man's affection, that if there be equalles, him we must prefer
^home no carnal property does set forth, lest that, which is done for
favor, be an ill presidente to sum other. There lies also in their names a
certain privy misterye hydden. Matthias, which in Hebrew betokens the gift
of god, was preferred before Just, which name the Phariseis did challenge for
their good works. And yet none more unmeet than they to preach the gospel.
But he that recogniseth the free gift of god, through faith of the gospel, and
preaches the same, he is worthy to succeed in place of thapostles. Neither did
Just disdain that his fellow was preferred, neither did Matthias, stand any
thing the more in his own conceyte, for that he was joined to the eleven
apostles, for to make up that same holy noumbre, nor for that he being a very
special good man, should succeed in ye room of the naughtiest fellow, that
ever was.

The.ii. Chapter.

When nine and fowertie days after Christ's resurreccion, were in this wise
ouerpassed, When the fifty days were cum to an end.
that day long looked for of Penthecoste, that is to say. Fyftyeth, was come:
which the Jews also kept holy with myrthe and great solempnitie, as well for
a remembrance of the year of Iubile, which came about every fiftieth year,
in course again, as also because the law was delivered in writing upon the
Mount Sinay, the fiftieth day after the kyllyng of the Paschall lamb:
through whose blood they departed safely out of Egipte. Upon an high
mountain was the old law given, being engraven in tables of stone. But the
new law the holy ghost entitled in faithful beleuyng hertes, and in a
high parlour it was disclosed. In the one and eke in the other, was highness of
place: on the one side, and like on the other, was fire. But there is naught
else for us to considre, but an high mountain, which the people being very
carnal and worldly, and therefore unapt to conceive spiritual things, were
forbidden, yea, so much as to touch. Here upon this mount an house there is,
whereby may we mark concord and unity to be in the church. There the
mount was called Sinay, a place convenient for the setting forth of such a
law, as should for the great nombre of sundry precepts that it contained,
keep under a stubburne and rebellyous people. For of precepte or
commandment, was that hill called Sinai. This mount here is named Syon,
which word with the Hebrews, betokens an high hill, from the top whereof,
al things on earth beneath are despised, from whence heavenly things are
seen far of, through faith, as though they were nigh at hand. On that mou^te
what is else seen but terrible fire, smoke, flames, lightening and thundering:
on this mount a spirit there is of great vehemency, cherefull to man, and
nothing dredful, and fire not to burn the body but to lighte^ the soul and
richely to endowe the plain tounged man with heavenly eloquence. There the
people being at square among themselves, murmured against their captain, here
be they quiet in one secret chau^bre, making their prayer with one assente,
for an heavenly gift, which they waited for. This day was chosen, like as
the place was also, for a matter of heavenly comfort, whereunto they had been
wont often to repair, for nine days space before. But wha^ the fyftyeth day
was once come, than came they altogether with full consent, into the self same
parlour, ready to receive the heavenly spirit. Where the mind is occupied
with vile and filthy cogitacions, there is no convenient place for the holy
ghost, but in ye parloure, where the company was so godly occupied, it behooved
him to be. And where the mind is troublous with discord, hatred, and
contencion, there is no mansion place for the holy ghost. When they were come
altogether into one place, and that on high, they continued in one faith,
prayer, and expectacion. And behold, sodaynely came the gift of god on high
from above. For suddenly from heaven came a sound, as it were of a great puff
of wind that carried it, and replenished ye whole parlour, where they satte
quiet and without trouble. It was not the northern wind, which blustereth
coolde out of the clouds: nor ye Sowtherne wind, that brings warmthe with
him out of the marryshe and fenny places, pestylent to all living bodies. But
it was a blast of heaven, procedyng thence, whither Christ himself went,
breathyng life everlasting into the soul of man, giving stre^gthe withal to
the weak, and cherefull courage unto the litleones. And there appared unto
the^ cloue^ tou^ges. etc.
This sound afraid no man, but stiered up all their minds to look for
that holy spirit, which was promised the^. One token of his cummyng to them,
served the ear, another was for the eye. For these are the two principal
senses in man. Tongues they saw like as they had been all of fire, dealyng
themselves to euerychone of the disciples, part to one, and part to another,
and restyng a while upon every man's head, to the intent that we should
plainly understand, how that gift shall endure for ever. One spirit enspired
all their minds, one fire kyndled each man's heart and tongue. And incontinent
upon this visible token there followed in them the efficacy of that heavenly
gift. For as many as there were present, like as if they had been transfourmed
suddenly into heavenly persons, and being replenished with the holy ghost, And
they wet filled all with the holy ghost. etc
began to speak diverse la^guages which they had never learned of man's
communication, but such as the spirit from heaven had enprinted in their
hertes. There is no membre in manne more pestilent than is an euel tou^ge: none
more profitable tha^ is ye good. But it was needful for such that should
sow in sundry wise, the doctrine of heaven among people of all languages, to
have their toungues endowed with heavenly knowelage, and more over flaming with
that burning charity, which is mete for the gospel. This was tha^ the chiefest
toke^ of Christ's faith evangelical, which token the lord promised them,
saying: they shall speak with new tounges. They that accuse men unjustly, that
slander their neighbor, such as forswear themselves, and those that speak
rybauldrye, a tongue they have inflamed, not with fire celestial, but with the
fire of hell infernal. Al such as contend in disputacion for vile things of
this world, have not yet received this tongue celestial. The apostles before
this time reasoned of loaves of bread, which they had left behynd, they
reasoned how the temporal kingdom of Israel should be advanced, who should sit
on ye upper hand, and who should have of al other, the soueraygntie. Such was
the tongue as man had, unmeet than to publyshe the gospel. But all that now they
think on, and whatsoever they speak of, al is spiritual, all is celestial,
and burning, al like fire. Put away the tongue, lay aside the spirit, and no
word is spoken. But a spirit celestial, utters a voice celestial, a burning
toungue in love like fire, rauisheth the hertes of the hearers, and inflameth
their minds. The proud pharisees toungue is styffe, the Philosopher be he
never so well learned, the Rethorician in his toungue never so well spoken, no man he moves thereby unto true gladness. For this gift cummeth only from
heaven. As for the disciples were naught else but instruments, whereby the holy
ghost uttered his mind. This gift cannot one give an other, neither any
delae it to himself, but god deals to each man as he shall think good. He
that has more given him, has no cause why he should despise an other that is
not so rewarded, but has cause why he should endeavor himself the more
readily to profit many therewith. The spirit is a thing of great vehemency,
the fire a very lively thing in operacion, and never at rest. The Apostles
now do sleep no more so soundely as they did before the death of their lord,
they hide themselves no more as they did soon after his resurrection, but now
cum they abroad, they preach here, and there, and openly to all men health
everlasting, freely given them through faith in Jesus, who was a little before
crucyfyed.

And the truth to say, that same City Jerusalem was at that time, as it were
a stage, where people do assemble to behold plays, fit for the first
beginning of this interlude, partly for the famous renoume of the city, and
partly for honor of the Paschall feast which was paste, When this was noysed
about, the multitude came together.
and finally, for the devotion that the people had to the solemn feast of
Penthecoste, many one were than abiding at Jerusalem, not all only such as
came out of all the parties of Siria, but out of all other cuntreyes also,
whither soever the violent rage of wars had dryeue^ them, or any chance else
had brought them. Among whom many were devout and well disposed people. When
this so strange a matter was than comenly known over all the city, a confuse
multitude of people came together, and being in a great perplexity, demanded
what these news should mean: that where as they were gathered out of many
countries, and were of soundry languages, yet for all that every man so
understood them speaking, even as though they had spoken to them al, not in one
tongue alone but to euerichon severally in his own country language. Yea ye
Hebrew tongue is not without his diversity, accordingly as cuntreyes are
divided, whether it came of diverse nations which bordre one upon an other, or
else of sum other chance. For the woman of Samaria, knew that Jesus was a Jew
by the property of his tongue, and Peter's pronounciacion declared him to be one
of Galilee. And ye Greek tongue likewise is parted into five sundry kinds. And
other nations also differs no less in their languages. More than that, many
Jews understood none other, than that country language, where they themselves
were borne. All sorts therefore of people, did greatly wondre thereat, and
reasoned, how such a thing might cum to pass, that never the like had been
heard nor read of. Thus they said: behold, a strange thing. Are not al
these that speak, They wordred at, and maruailed.
men of Galile? how than cummeth this about, that we, being so many men of
diverse languages, as often as we hear any of them speak, do understand him as
perfectly, as if each of us heard his own country language, where he was
borne, sens that this multitude of us is gathered of so diverse and sondrye
regions, there be of us here Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and such also as
does inhabit all abroad the coasts of Iewry, and besides that Capadocia,
Pontus and that country which peculiarly is called Asia, Phrigia, Pamphilia,
Egipte, and those parties of Libia, which reach to Ciren. Yea and sum be here
whose dwelling is at Rome, some of them Jews borne, and some Proselites, that
is to say, such as has of their own desire professed the Iewishe religion.
Moreover Cretes and Arabians. All we that here be gathered, of so many nations,
of so sundry languages, do hear and plainly understand them speaking,
nothing of comen usage, or else things to the worldly man perteynyng, but of
high matters of weygh^y importance, yea things convenient and mete for god.
After this manner reasoned as many as feared god, and were abated in their
courage at the strangeness of the thing, and said: what means this wondre?
They found no fault with that thing which their reason could not attain unto,
as y^ Phariseis were wont to do, but they searched for diligently and desired
to learn y^ which they perceived not. On the other part such as were
hedling, and nothing upright in judgment, did say in scorn: the me^ be drunk
with new wine: these persons a man may call, those phariseis disciples, which
reported of Jesus: ye devil is within him. And to say always ye very truth,
great dronkenes is not much unlike to fury, They were all amassed, and wo^dred.
etc.
for it chances peradventure, that some in a fury shall speak diverse words
of sondyry languages which they never learned. But no fury will this undertake,
that al me^ shall understand that that you do speak. But truly these words
spoke they for a mock. Albeit a man may sometime tell the truth although he
spoke in a skoffyng wise. For a suerty full were they of ye new wine, which ye
lord would not have in any wise put into old bottels. For the old wine of
Moses law had lost his strength and virtue, when Christ was first insured
by marriage to his church, and the cold and unsavory sense of the law was
turned by Christ into new wine. Whatsoever is carnal* is unsavory and
faynte in virtue: all that spiritual is, whatsoever it be, is lively,
strengthfull and sauery. Uery largely did they drink of that celesticall cup,
whereof David the writer of psalms speaks: how excellent is my cup which
makes the drounke. And if it were lawful to compare things together, which
are throughout all their kind most unlike: this vulgar and common
drounkennesse does engendre in man ^ower things chiefly: it utters the
secrets of the heart: it causes man to forget all his adversity that is
past, and makes the mind to rejoice in continual hope of prosperity to
come: it enboldeth man to set naught, yea, by his own life. Last of all it
makes men, which are of a rude and barbarous tongue, to be well spoken men.
Now mark my sayings, whither that new sweet wine, which proceeded of Gods
own spirit* engendre not such a like thing in thapostles, for what they had
hyd for fear and durst not speak, what they before had learned secretly, and
would not be acknowen, that do they now publishe, and according to the
lords prophecy, the same they preach upon house tops. Their old Jewish
fashions they have clean forgotten, and like as infantes newly borne, no more
do they now remember their life before past, neither have they in mind the
troublous affliccions, for fear whereof they had forsaken their master. And
although they were bare without all worldly help and succoure, yet they
feared neither gouernoures, ne princes, presidentes ne kings, neither
counselles, nor imprisonmentes, no soondry torments, no manier kind of
death, enduryng lusty always, being of courage, and cherefull through the
promyses of Christ's gospel. Finally, they which were before but poor
fyshers and men unlearned, forthwith practiced their celestial eloquence, in
rebukyng the proud Phariseis, confutyng the subtle and crafty Philosophers,
and in puttyng theloquent orators to vttre scilence. Nothing there is of more
peril or difficulty, than to speak before a great coumpanye, which as it
is like a monstreous beast of soundrye headdes, so it is most of all times
monstreous, when the multitude is collected of soondry languages, and soondry
nations.

Now mark me here Simon Peter, who suddenly of a fysher was made an Orator.
The multitude stirred up a clamorous rumor: And as they did than, the same
like shall other do hereafter unto the worlds end. Than was it the part of
a good shepeherd, to step abroad valiauntlye amongst them, not for that intent
he should by force appear or make them still, which murmured against gods
glory, or else to render one check for an other, but that he might constauntly
rather than fyercely, But Peter stepped forth.
put away by testimonies of holy scripture, all false and craftye accusacion,
and stoutely defend the glory of Christ. Than Peter, who had before rysenne
up in the parlour, to see the noumbre of thapostles fulfilled, now eftesoones
stood up to the multitude of people, of soondry nations, mengled together,
partly to enstruct them that had said: What means this? and partly to
stop their months, that had said: these men be drounke with new wine.
Albeit it is not of necessity requisite, that a bishop should preach to the
people always standing, forasmuch as Christ himself sittyng, taught the
people: Yet he that takes in hand an apostles office, ought to stand upright
in mind. And here consydre in ye mean while Peter's dignity. He was the
first man ready where occasion required, to set forth the gospel. Than had
he put up his material sweorde, wherewithal Christ himself was not pleased,
and pulled out a spiritual sweord. Such one ought he to be, that is the
chief bishop among the people. Peter stood up, but not all alone, he had
eleven apostles standing besides with him, lest he should seem to usurp to
himself some violente governance. One uttered the tale, but one for all
the other, like as he alone before openly confessed in the name of all the rest,
Jesus Christ to be the son of the living God. But whereupon did this
shepeherd, a pore creature, unlearned, so boldly vaunt himself, as once to
look upon so great an assembly of people? Excellent oratoures, when they shall
come before an assembly of people, or in presence of princes, to pronounce an
exact oracion, which they have canned on their fyngers ends, do change
oftentimes their color, cannot utter their words, and in mind they are not a
little abashed. But this undoubtedly was that heavenly drounkennesse, this was
that sobrefulnesse of sweet wine. He stood in presence before a great
multitude, he took unto him eleven apostles, not as a garrison of men for his
defense, but as fellows with him of one company: he set his iyes steadfastly
upon the people, With the eleven.
as one unknown to them, whom he knew not, he lift up his voice on high,
and taking none aduysemente with himself what he would say, he spoke to
them, practisyng even than the self same thing, which the lord before had
taught him. He spoke not for his own lucre and aduau^tage, but as a good
shepeherde, defended his flock, neither handled he his matters with sharp
words of man's inuencion, but used for his defense, only holy scripture. Now
was this multitude desirous to know what Peter would say. And let us likewise
for our parts give head, forasmuch as these his words were spoken to all
men. At the beginning, when he had once with the mouyng of his hand, assuaged
the murmur and the noise of the company, he began with such a preface, as
should, without any retorical color of flattery, make them attent. Ye that
are my brethren (says he) of Iewry, who ought to know both the law, and eke
the prophets, and of all other most specially, which dwell in this noble
city of Jerusalem, where the fountain is of religion, With your ears bear
ye my words.
and knowleage of the law, somewhat peradventure here is for you to wondre at,
but nothing that any man can justly find fault withal. Wherefore, all ye that
here be present give good ear a while to my words, and learn of me how the
thing stands. For it is touching all your profittes so to do. These men of
Galile, whom here ye see stand by me, are not, (as some of you suppose,)
drounken with new wine, seeing it is yet but three of the clock, For these
men are not as ye suppose. etc.
and no man is woonte to be drounke in the morning before the son rysyng. But
now ye see that in these men is fulfilled, which thing to come, god did long
before this time promise by his prophet Iohel. Harken unto the prophecy, and
trus^e ye to that that is promised you therein. Do not ye find fault with the
thing, because ye have seldom seen the like, but rather enbrace that
mercifulnes, which god does profte unto you. For Iohel, being inspired with
the holy ghost, foreseing that god, who had given to Moses, and some others his
prophets at soondry times his own blessed spirit for your salvation, would
at the last, after he had sent his own only begotten son, power out most
plenteously the same spirit, not upon one or.ii. like as ye have seen for
these many ages past but a few prophets: but upon all nations through the
world, whosoever would with sincere faith receive this chereful and gladsome
message, which we at his commandment do now bring unto all you, has left
that heavenly prophecy in writing after this manier. It shall come to pass,
says the lord, in the latter days of the world, I will power out of my
spirit bou^tifully upon all men, and sodaynely shall your sons prophecy, and
your daughters, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall
dream dreams, and upon my servants, and upon my hand maids will I power
out of my spirit in those days, and they shall prophecye. And I will show
woonders in heaven above, and tokens on the earth beneth, blood and fire, and
the vapor of smoke. The Sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
blood, before that the great and notable day of the lord come. And whosoever
shall call upon the name of the lord shall be saved. These things has the
prophet Iohell told you in his prophecye, many lives a go. And now ye see
that, that he prophesied of, as touching the plentiful shedyng of the spirit,
in effect declared before your iyes. And it is not to be doubted, but that god
will as faithfully perform the same, that thaforesayde Iohell has prophesied
of the plages that shall chance. But there is no cause why ye should
despair, the prophet teaches you a sure way to your salvation, seeing that he
shows to you the peril and daungier thereof. Call ye upon the name of the
lord, and ye shall be saved.

But as touching the manner how ye must call upon the name of the lord, lysten
ye that are the children of Israel now unto me, and to the rest of my tale
give good head. Many of you knew Jesus of Nazareth, which person being long
a go promised, by the sayings of all the prophets, god has now set
abroad before all you to behold, and has commended him to you in sundry and
great miracles, and wonders which he has done and wroughte by him before all
your iyes. For verayly god was in him. I speak of a thing not unknown to you,
for the fame of his miracles is not alonely blased wide abroad thorough out all
Iewry, but is come unto other cities also, bordering nyghe upon the same. For
why? He himself went on wayfaryng from place to place, over all this region,
healyng every where the sick with his word, restoryng the lame and impotent
to their strength again, giving syghte to the blind, clensyng the leprye,
casting out deiuils: a great sort of you has seen the things that I
rehearse. None of all these miracles was done, but God before purposed the same.
And it was the will of god thus to save the world. After that ye had taken
this man, not by chance or at adventure, but as one delivered by the
determinate will or counsel of God and his foreknowledge, for the salvation of
his people of Israel, ye crucyfyed him by the hands of the unrighteous
soldiers, and slew him. For the soldiers were naught else in doing that
heinous fact, saving only your ministers. But he slays the manne that
procures his death. The matter is to plain for to be denied. This manne whom
ye have slain, as God would have it, who had delivered him for to be slain,
the very self same god, according to the soothe saying of his Prophets,
has called up the third day to life again, Whom God has raised up, and
loosed the sorrows of death.
that all, which truly shall believe the gospel, should hope for the same
thing to be done hereafter in themselves, which was by the power of God, once
dooen in him. For he in obeyinge his fathers will, suffered the spiteful
reproach of the cross patiently, puttyng his whole affiaunce and trust of
salvation not in man's aid and defense, but in the mercyfulnes of God: and
therefore was he delivered by him of all deadly sorrows and pains infernal,
which truly he might, by reason that he was man, have tasted or felt. But as
he was clean without sin: so he could be kept in no wise in their bondage.
For death and hell has no perpetual authority and power, but upon them that
are subject unto sin. Wherefore, like as death was of might to swallow him,
so was it not able to hold him, being once deuowred, but cast him up, as it
was thereto constreyned, the third day, even as did the whale reuomet the
prophet Jonas. Than was it the will of God that this innocent should suffer
all these injuries, to the intent that he would deliver us all by him, both of
sin, and deaths tyranny, if that we, according to Jesus example of Nazareth
put our whole trust and affyau^ce in God. What I have told you now, my
brethren of Israel, ye ought not to think it incredible, sens that David
being enspyred with the celestyall spirit of prophecy, For Dauyd speaks of
him. Before hand I saw god all ways before me.
told you long heretofore, that it should even thus come to pass. For in
his fiftenth psalm he speaks of Jesus of Nazareth, whom we preach to you
in this manier. Aforehande have I set the Lord always before me, for he is on
my right hand, that I should not be moved. Therefore did my heart rejoice,
and my tongue was glad, moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope because
thou shalt not leave my soul in hell, neither shalt thou suffer thy holy to
see corruption. Thou haste showed me the ways of life, thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance. Ye see how evidently has that king and
prophet David described, and as it were in a lively picture, set before
your iyes, that, which ye know well enough, is dooen and paste in Jesus of
Nazareth. He had made God alone his fortress of defense, and trustyng to his
only help, suffered he wyllingly and gladlye all those peynes, which he, as
you do know, has suffered. And in sufferyng bodyly peynes, he rejoiced
inwardely. His tongue for joy never ceased to speak, never kept in silence the
will of God. He was contented for to be buried, although he nothing mistrusted
but that his father would call him up to life again the third day, and would
not suffer him, who had put his whole trust in god, being in no point guilty,
to purrefye in his grave. For whosoever trusts to be saved by his own
works, or puts his trust in worldely succoure, he shall be found far unmeet
to suffer the paynful dolours of death patiently, neither shall he be hable when
he is once entangled, to looce himself out of deaths snare. But he that
continually fixes the inward iye of his soul to godward, which to al people
is mercyful, he knows already the ways of life: and although god seems to
turn away his countenance from him for a time, yet shall he again, or it be
long, disclose to him the beams of his mercy, and requite him for his
torments, which endures but for a time, with joys eternal, and for death,
yield everlasting life, for yearthely reproach the glory of heaven. Wherefore
than, we also are taught by him, and his example, the way to life everlasting.

Some peradventure shall suppose that this prophecy does perteine to David
himself, and not to Jesus: I am not ignorant how highlye ye esteem David the
Patriarch, and that not without a cause are ye in such an opinion of him. For
he was blessed and derely beloved with god, but frankelye to speak the truth
to you, well-beloved brethren, we must not set so much by David the Patriarch,
as to ascribe to him that as his own, which is due unto Messiah. For he is
both dead and buried. etc.
The thing trewly it self declares, that this prophecy agrees neither with
David ne with any other Patriarch or prophet. For David, as each one of you
know full well, is dead and buried, and never came afterward to life again,
seeing that his sepulcher is with us unto this present day, conteynyng naught
in yt else but dead dry bones, without any life at all in them. Wherefore
David, who knew that he himself should be as other were, buried, and as
touching his body should rotte in his grave, disclosed not this prophecye of
himself. But where as he was enspyred with the spyryte of prophecye, and knew
right well that that should come to pass, which god had assured to him upon
an oath, that is to say, Therefore seeing he was a prophet.
that Christ, as touching his humanity, should be borne of his progeny, and
after the spiritual understanding, should sit upon his throne to reign for
ever, prophesied as one that knew perfectly what should happen, of these
things which ye se now performed in Jesus of Nazareth, who doubtless was
borne as touching his humanity, of David's kindred and family. Ferthermore, sins
that it is evidently known that Jesus in his life time did affect no worldly
kingdom, and never sat upon David's regal seat, but was most spitefully
dealed with all, He knowi^g this before, spoke of the resurrection of Christ.
it appears plainly that there was some other kingdom promised which as the
prophets say, has none end. He could not sit upon David's seat if that he
being once slain, had never arisen to life again. He therefore is arisen from
death to life again, and sytteth now upon David's seat, that is to say,
upon the seat of his eternal father, the Lord of all things that are in
heaven and eke in earth.

This was it undoubtedly, that David being inspyred with the spirit of
prophecy, spoke of before, and what he before has spoken, that is come to
pass. And although Jesus soul went down to hell, yet there it was not
withholden, but rather delivered the souls which were from liberty
restreigned. Yea although his body was laid in grave void of all life, yet
there it did not rotte or putrifye: but god who in all his promises can not
lie, has called his soul from hell again, and has restored the same to his
own former body. Whereof all we are witnesses.
Of this thing we all bear witness, whom here ye see standing, which have
traded our lives familiarly with him, which have heard him oftimes say, that
he should be both crucified according to ye prophets sayings, and
afterward arise the third day to life again. We were those persons that both
saw him a dooyng, and heard him, and now be witnesses of his resurreccion,
to whom he has oftetymes appeared not alonely as one seen of us and heard, but
felt also with our hands, we knew his voice, we knew his face, we knew and
felt the printed dentes of his wounds, finally he eat together in company
with us, to the intent that we might be well assured, to se the very same body
there with us, that lay in his sepulcher.

Wherefore than, the self same person, whom man overthrew and brought to
extreme vilany and reproach, god has now advanced to the height of eternal
glory: which glory he shall once set open manifestly to all men, at the end
of the world: and now does he in the mean season, put forth with you the
power of his godhead, by secret operacion of the holy ghost, which he, whiles
he lived upon earth, promised to send us from his father. Now has he being
returned again to heaven, powered from thence the same spirit upon us
bounteously, according to Iohels prophecy above mentioned. And of him cummeth
this strange miracle that ye see and hear us speak in languages, which you
being gathered here together out of sondrye nations do semblably understand.
And like as the prophecy of the resurreccion can not be understand of David, as
we have to you declared: even so, that thing which was prophesied of his
ascending up to heaven, For David is not ascended into heaven.
and of the sitting on the right hand of god his father, and of his
everlasting kingdom, can not perteyne to David, like as the Pharisees
theymselues, reasoning with out master confessed. For David never ascended up
to heaven, as he that had before returned to his life again, and yet for all
that in the mystical psalm, thus says he being enspired with the spirit of
prophecye: the lord said to my lord sit on my right hand, until I make
thine enemies thy footestole. Wherefore than, the matier is plain, that this
prophecye was spoken of god the father, God has made the same Jesus (wh^me ye
have crucified) Lord and Christ.
who has exalted to heaven Jesus ye son of David, as touching his humanity,
but as concerning the spirit the lord of David, and would that he should sit
by him, as copartener of his kingdom. Therefore let all the whole people of
Israel be well assured that the self same Jesus of Nazareth, whom ye once
crucified, god has now advanced to the kingdom of heaven, and has made him
lord over all, and Messyas, that is to say, the annoyncted, whom ye look for
as your Messiah, which was promised of all the prophets now many hundred
years ago.

This tale of Peter's made the hearers thereof sore afraid. For they were prime
to their own doings, how they had cried out upon Pilate, crucifye him,
crucifye him, crucifye him: and perceived by reason of the prophecy, how he
was made on the right hand of his father, copartener of his kingdom, until
all his enemies were brought under his fotestoole. Whom they had put to
death, being as he was unto them beneficial, of the same now, sense he is
cum unto his reign, were they afraid, lest he would take vengeance upon
them. This is a beginning to a man's salvation, to knowleage his fault, and
to fear the pain deserved for the same. Therefore they being than pricked in
conscience, said to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles: what must we do,
well-beloved brethren? It is well, when a man feling himself of a guilty
conscience, dispaireth not, but ensearcheth for remedy. Now what does Peter
in this case, who represented a sobre and a meke shepeherde? he exercises no
tyranny amongst them with reprocheful checkes, he heapeth not together their
faults, he puts not them abacke with a delay, he wills them not to kill
beasts for sacrifice, but declares to the sorrowful hertes, a remedy even at
hand putting no difference bitwixt them that had crucified Jesus, and those
which had not consented to that wicked act. For none of them all was clean
without sin. And therefore says he, do ye repent your life that is past,
and let euerychone of you be baptized in water, in the name of Jesus Christ:
and for that benefits sake, which he has freely done to us, ye shall have
forgeuenes of all your sins: and shall receive after that ye be purely
cleansed, the gift of the holy ghost, which ye here see shed on us. For ye
promise* was made to you and to your children
Let none of you pondre and weigh his own merits, for all that here is given,
is freely given, upon this only condition, that ye believe. Iohels prophecy
does specially pertain to you, and your children that come after you, whom
he calls sons and daughters, whom he calls servants and handemaydes.

Believe god that made you the promis, and ye shall freely receive forthwith that
is promised. Neither does Iohels promise in his prophecy pertayne to you
alone, which are of the people of Israel, but to all the heathen also, which
be far of both from al kindred with the Israelites, and far from knoweleage of
god, whom ever our lord god shall of his merciful goodness vouchesafe to call,
to be partakers with us of this his gift. And the same thing has the
prophecy well declared, where it says: and whosoever shall call upon the name
of the lord, shall be saved. Albeit each man that says, Lord, Lord, does
not call upon the lord, but he that puts all his whole hope and trust of
salvation, in the mercyfulnes of the same lord. Other prophets also has
spoken of the same thing, that the word of the gospel should in time cumming
spread throughout the world. And besides this, our master Jesus gave us a
special commandment, And with many other words bare he witness. etc.
that we should first of all declare to you, this merciful message of peace
and love, and that we should than afterward, call the gentiles to the same:
For this calling cummeth not of man's deseruinges, but of the fre bounteousenes
of god. In these words and others many mo, Peter bare witness to them of
Christ, bryngyng forth to them, the prophets sayings to testify the same,
and conferring with them those things, which had already than come to pass.

And beside his teachinges, he exhorted them that he might the better prick
them forewarde which were of wavering minds. Go to, he says, my brethren,
embrace ye this so excellent bounteousnes of god toward you, And ex^orted
t^em, saying: Save your selves from this untoward generation.
so ready to mete you. Ye know what complaints all the prophets has made of
the ouerthwartenes, and stubbernes also, in this Iewyshe nation, which has
declared themselves at all times, rebellyous to their lord, and god: and to
those, which were sent to them, his mynisters for their salvation. How often
times did they resist Moses? how many prophets have they slain? how often
have they provoked god to anger with their mischeuous deeds? Wherefore they be
justly named the house that makes the lord angry, and the vine turned to
bitterness, which yeldeth to his keeper instead of sweet grapes, wild vynes.
John the baptiste lamented in them the same thing: calling them a progeny of
serpents. And our master Jesus complained not a few times, of the self same
thing, being offended with many of them, for their invincible frowardenesse,
who seeing did not see, and hearing did not hear, and understanding did not
understand. The wholesome doctrine for man's soul they despised, and all such
benefits as he wrought in man through his miracles, they imputed to the
spirit of Beelzebub. Wherefore he called them a froward nation, and hard or
ill wylled to believe, and bewayling their state, told them that they should
be destroyed: for why? they had beaten, killed, stoned, and crucified, all that
were sent from god. Draw your selfs a back my brethren, and get ye away from
the vengeance of god, which hangs over your heads, cast of all cankred
frowardenes of the Jewish nation, which, while they stand stifely in defense
of their own Justice, do wickedly rebel against the justice of God. For ye
have by faith and sincere obedyence, already for you provided eternal
salvation. Than shall ye finally be accoumpted the true Israelites, than shall
ye be the very children of Abraham. Than shall ye be of the right sort of
Jews, in deed, if ye will knowelage Jesus, and recognize him for your king.

Rid your hands of this carnal generation which would rather perish for
their incredulity, than be saved. Be ye contented to be borne a new and
transfourmed into a spiritual nacio^, and celestial, which by trust in Jesus
is in way of salvation. Of this sort verily was the fishers eloquence which
he piked not out of Retorical precepts or rewlers, but received it from heaven
and therefore it was of much more power and efficacy in his operacion. This
was the same su^^orde, that enters through, even to the dividing of the soul
and the spirit, whose edge has punched and stricke^ ye Jews hertes. This was
the first cast and throw of his net, wherein the fisher of man's soul, drew up
a great plenteous multitude. This was the seed of the gospel, that ought to
be cast every where abroad, which (as Christ has taught) falls not down
into all men's hertes, and yet here it found forthwith good ground, which
brought forth fruit. For than were baptized, and to the number of the disciples
(which were at that time very few) were increased and joined, Then they that
gladly received his preaching. etc.
almost three thousand more. These were the luckie first fruits that the
ghospel brought forth for his revenues. The new testament agrees in this
point also with a figure of tholde: Moses commanded a feast of the first
fruits to be kept holy the fiftieth day after Easter. And here are consecrated
to the lord this fiftieth day, ye first fruits, not of ears of corn, but of
men's souls. For now through preaching of the gospel, and faith in the same,
the water washed away all their sins, and now was that heavenly spirit
gredely received. Now mark, what does that spirit of god in them, truly he
is not idle, sithen that he is like unto the fire. We are freely made clean in
soul as innocents, we have freely received of the holy ghost his gift of grace.
Now it rests for our part to take heed, that we lose that unadvisedly,
which god has of his merciful goodness, freely given us. Such are the first
beginninges of euangelycall religion, such is as a man would say, the
childehood of our first regeneracion in Christ. All that we have taught
hitherto, is as it were milk for infauntes, we must proceed further to whole
and fast meat. Preachers and such as feed with the word of god, ought to
have with them both kinds of meat ever ready at hand. For thus the lord
commanded them, go ye forth, he says, and teach all people, baptizing
them, and teaching them to keep all that I have commanded you. Teach them
that must be christened, the rudimentes and first beginninges of the gospel,
which rudimentes or principles, except a man will believe, his Baptism is
in vain. Those that be already baptized, thus must ye teach, that they live
after my teachynges, procedyng always to more perfeccion.

Than such as kept themselves in company with the disciples, followed on
continually the apostles teachinges (for thereby came most profit) and
likewise continued still in receiving a token of a couenaunte, that shall never
be broken, which they called communion. That token of covenant which the lord
taught, and committed to us of trust, was done in this manner. The bread was
broken and dealed to every man a piece thereof, and they in their practicing of
this in a remembrance of the lords passion, In breaking of bread. etc.
gave thanks to god for his bountiful goodness, that had cleansed them from
sin by the innocent blood of his own son alone, and had chosen them for
the deaths sake which he suffered, on his part undeserved, to enherite life
everlasting. They offered up also their prayers with clenes of heart, whose
peticion was that the kingdom of Jesus might be made to spread every day
further abroad than other, And in prayers.
that his glory might throughout all the world be known, that his will every
where might be followed, that such as had once professed the faith of the
gospel, might through the holy word, and grace celestial, profit every day,
and proceed better and better, and so might live in concord one with an other,
each one in peace with his brother forgeuing all injuries, if any fault were
done by man's frayltie, being at one with god, which is merciful to them that
be merciful to their neighbor, and that they being daily strengthened by
the goodness of god, might steadfastly abide all the assautes of Satan, until
they might after long bickering with the said Satan, And fear came over
every soul.
at last receive eternal reward. These were than the sacrifices that
christen men used. This wonderful miracle of tongues, Peter's exhortacion so
lively made, the sudden mutacion of so many men, so great purity an clennesse
of life of the same men, wrought such an effect in all their minds, which
were guilty and privy to their own offenses, that they were sore afraid of
some eiuell to come toward them. For they saw plainly, that this thing was
not brought about by man's conspyracy, but by some celestial power. And for
because thapostles did not alonely speak in all men's languages, but wrought
also at Jerusalem, many wonderful miracles, at thinuocacion of Jesus name, in
healyng diseases, in putting deiuils to flight, in reising the dead to life.
This tremblyng fear that they were in, encroched and grew still more and more
upon them. This was some beginning in the people toward their amendment.
But the celestial spirit wrought in their hertes, whom secretly he inspired,
above all other things, in mutual good will and concord. For this truly is
the very cognisaunce that Jesus would have his disciples known by.

And as many as believed the gospel, assembled unto a place ordinately together
for their consolacion, exhorting one an other in mutual communycacions. They
were than many in number and men of al sorts were admitted, without accepcion
of persons, young, old, men, women, free, bond, poor, and rich. The love
of Christ being planted in their hertes, did in so great conformity of
minds and mutual concord, knyt and join together them all, being otherwise
so far odd each to other, that all things were common emo^gest them, which
is a thing seldom seen, yea among brethren that came all out of one belly. And
to the intent that each of them, might the better depart somewhat of that he had
to an other, And sold their possessions and goods.
such as had manoures of their own, or other possessions, sold them, and of
the money, or prise thereof, made a common dole, as every man's need required,
so that neither they wanted which had naught of their own, nor they had more
than was sufficient which before had much in possession. And so made they
their dole, not as it were of their own proper goods, but as of things in
common. For perfect charytie chalengeth no goods, as her own, and among them
which be all of one mind, no man is accoumpted a lord of his own goods,
and where each man is content with litel, thereit will be hard to find lack
of things necessary. But the distribucion of the common was made to every man,
according to his necessity, and not to his sensuality. The apostles
prescribed none of all these things for them to do: but charity did more
among them without compulsion, than any law of Moses durst require. And every
day were they also in the temple, in much unity of mind, steadfast in prayer,
rendryng thanks to god, and exhortinge theimselues together, and entising
other to that peace of conscience, which ye gospel requires, all that ever
they were hable to coumpace.

Moreover when they had thus spent the whole day in such godly excercises,
they brake in every house their bread, And brake bread from house to house.
etc.
and eat their meat together, with joy that heart cannot think, and each one
with other in perfect clenlynes of heart, gave praise to god, through whose
goodness they had gotten them so much love and favor. They were in favor and
good estimacion with all the people. For who is he that would not love such
persons, that hurt no man, and be ready to do every man good, in whom also
appeared manyfestly so much godly power, so great sobrenesse and mekenes
withal.

Here may thou well mark, Theophilus, how the church had at her beginning
by reason of joy in men's hertes and unity with all, luckie tokens well to
prosper. There must needs be conformitee of minds and unity, where that
spirit is, which is the pacifier of all troubleous hertes: there cannot be
but joy and gladness, where is a clean conscience, without any dystruste of the
promises, which are made in the gospel. But as the bishopes, Pharisees,
Scribes and chief auncientes, or head men among the people, were every where
always ready to slay Jesus: so here at the luckye beegynnynges of this young
church, no mention is made of them. Noe person was enforced to come to this
feloweship, no violente authority kept them together in league. Such as
thither came, abode there still with other of their own ientle courage, and
the lord allured to them, whom he had appoincted to be saved, every day more
and more, while the small musterd-seede, was by litell and litell springyng,
which should afterward spread his branches abroad, through all the world.

The.iii. Chapter.

PEter and John went up together in company with other into the temple, about
the ninth hour of the day, being than far ouerpaste, at which hour, they,
whereas other be woonte to play the drounkardes, or else to sleep, had
accustomed themselves daily to devout prayer, fasting until it were euentide.
These two went forth, the piers of thapostles, without trapped horses, or
barted mules, without any princely guard, but hear what pomp they used. There
sat before the temple gate a beggar well known among the people, which had
been ever lame from the first hour of his birthe, and so weak a body
withal, that he was borne all a long of porters. Many one, as it chanced,
fared the better by his misery.

For every day laid they him forth for their own advantage, at the temple
gate, which the vulgar people called beautiful (for that was most haunted)
to the intent that he should there ask, as in a place most frequented, men's
alms, which went into the temple. Beggary is not without his shyf^e, it
knows that those which enter into the temple, are than either disposed to
give with better will their alms, or else would appear to the people so
disposed. When he saw Peter and John. etc.
When he had once perceived that Peter and John, whom their company which
followed them declared to be of some estimacion, and they theymselues in
countenance seemed to be liberal, would into the temple, he asked of them
an alms. Here gave the holy ghost privy warning to thapostles, that it was
than a time convenient to work a miracle. Than Peter and John also,
stedfastely beheld the same creple, and said: look on us. The beggar being
at the sight and coumfortable voice of them, quycker in spirit and of better
cheer, iyed them well, hoping shortly some thing to receive of them. Money he
craved, for money he looked, as for the good disposicion of his lymmes, he durst
not once ask. For why? he thought them not able to give it. And yet for all
that, his heart gave him that some goodness should happen he wist not what.
Than Peter set forth himself stoutely in words, which were full well semyng
to Christ's high vicare to speak, and said: silver and gold which thou
lookeste for, have I none. What is here ready at hand, not of mine own, but
of the bounteousenesse of god, which thou dooeste rather lack, that give I
thee. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk. In ye name of
Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk.
And with that he took the creple by the right hand, and raised him up. And
immediately without any delay, his feet and ancle bones were made strong, in
such sort, that he might arise without pain or difficulty, yea and leap,
stand, and walk, whyther ever he would. But he, as one right glad in
heart of such a benefit unlooked for, went with thapostles together into the
temple, walkyng cherefully and leapyng for joy and reioysyng, and geuyng laud
and praise to god, of whom he knew that this his benyfite of health, had
proceeded. To hyde the benefits of God, is the condition of an unthankful
person: to ascribe the same to manne, is a point of much ungodliness.

All the people, that was in the temple, which were in number very many,
beheld the manne that was wont to be carried with porters, than walking on
foot cherefully, and rendering praise to god. And each man knew him to be the
self same person, that was wount to sit at the beautiful gate a begging. They
beheld him suddenly changed. They heard him giving God thanks. Whereupon all
they were greatly dismayed, and suddenly stricken with no little wondre. But
after that they saw Peter and John, which than were known with many, for the
chief among all the apostles, (for he that was lame kept himself on their
party, and blased abroad how it chanced him to come to health by their
means) the whole assembly of all the people made straight toward them. Than
were they in the porche, which is called Salomons porch, where Jesus the true
Solomon, was wont to be and where he had been woonte often times to dispute
with the Phariseis. The strangeness of the thing abated all their courages.

When Peter saw the fast gathering together of the people, and knew right
well the cause thereof, he began in this manner to vttre again his mind to
them, and said: ye men of Israel, why do ye so much marvel at this matter,
as though it were a seldom thing with you, and long out of use to see miracles:
or like as if ye had not seen heretofore in times paste, greater things and
more to merueyle at than this? But why do ye behold us, as though it had by
our own power, or deserving, be brought to pass, that this lame criple, a man well known among you, does now walk? It is not man's practice which
here is done, neither is it a new thing, which ye do see that heretofore has
not been spoken of, but such a thing that god long a go promised by your
prophets. Reverently ye do worship the god of Abraham, the god of Isaac, and
the god of Jacob, and ye auaunt your selfs in that ye have them as your
chief fathers, and first beginners of your auncestry, but the very son of
this same god, whom the chief fathers of your auncestry has wurshipped, being
sent to you for your salvation, poor and simple to look upon, to thintente
that you should make the more of him, as a famil^^^e person like to one of
you, ye have brought to extreme vilanny and reproach. Notwithstanding the self
same god has by his infinite might and power, advanced his son to high
renoume and glory, one whom man of malice, has overthrown, and god has in
this fact, like as he has also many other ways, wroughte by him miracles out
of number, before your iyes, and taught you doctrine from heaven. But ye never
a deal the better for all such benefits, delivered him at the last, after many
reproachful injuries, into the hands of the wicked, to the intent he should be
slain, yea and where as Pilate a Panim, a man both without knowleage of your
law, and of no kindred with your forefathers, would have given sentence of him
as of your king, as of a blessed person and innocent for his deliverance, ye
which ought by reason of that knowlage ye had of prophecies, to recognize him,
have styfely denied him, and openly, in the presidentes high hall of
judgment, saying: we have no king but Ceasar. And in such a cruel rage ye
were of rancour against him and hatred, that lieffer had ye to have Barrabas,
that notable thief and sedicious person pardoned at your request, which had
despatched other of their lives, than to have Jesus saved, who brought with
him life for all men. For a murderers life, ye obtained pardon, but for the
authoure of everlasting life, ye procured death. Nevertheless, God his
father, the authoure and maker of all life, has raised him whom ye have
slain, from the dead to life again, and liberally has rewarded him with life
that never shall have end. To the which thing bear we witness, unto whom he
himself, after he was revived, eftsoon plainly appeared for us to behold,
for us to hear, and handle, whom we beheld also going up to heaven. He came
first to you in a pore and simple array, which he was contented to take upon
him for all your sakes, but now is he by his father advanced to glory, and
puts forth his power and strength by us, Of yt which we are witnesses.
which be naught else but witnesses to the things, which we have seen and
heard. And for that trust and affyaunce which we have in his name, this man,
whom you see walk, borne, as ye well know, both halte and lame, almightye
god has restored to his perfect limbs again. No praise herein are we worthy
to have, neither are we through our merytes, the cause thereof, neither he
that is restored, but god the father, as I said, would have his sons name
magnifyed with all men, in the which name his pleasure is, that all people
should put their full trust, and hope of health universal: by this assured
trust and confidence, is this man, which has been ever weak, from the first
hour of his birth, perfectly now, as ye all do see, in all his limbs
restored. These be evident arguments not alonely to prove that he is on live,
whom ye suppose to be dead, but to declare also that all men's hope of
salvation, is to be put in him alone.

And cause there is none at al, my brethren, why ye should despair, for it
has thus come to pass according to the will of God and his sufferaunce. Your
offense herein and trespase is partly excused by man's ignorance. For his
feeble and weak body was a let to you and impedimente, to know his divine
power, which divine and godly power, no not your rewlers them selfs knew
perfeictly. Which thing in him, if they had known readily, never would they
have been in mind to crucify the Prince of glory.

But so was it expedient for man's salvation, so had god determined before the
beginning, so had he before showed by the mouth of all his Prophets, that
Messiah, whom he would send fynallye to redeem you, should suffer death.
Now is god no liar: whom he promised to send, the same person has he sent:
whom he would have slain, even so, as he would have it, is he slain. This
sacrifice would he have offered up to satisfy for the sins of all the
world, by you was this sacrifice offered, not without blame to you, but such
as ye shall have forgyuenesse of, if ye repent that ye have dooen amiss. And
so shall it come to pass, that your offense, which you committed to the weal
of all men, shall turn to your singular wealth also.

For your pardon is easy to come by and ready at hand. Only be you ashamed of
your evil doings and sorrowful, not alonely for this fact, but for all other,
and see that you turn to a new life: openly confess that Jesus, whom ye
before have denied, is king and rewler over all: whom ye have to death
condemned, as a person guilty, now do ye acknowledge to be the very fountain
and giver of all innocence, and whom ye have violently put to death, believe ye
to be the author of immortal life. Now is the time of pardon for sin, haste
you this mean while to penance, and you shall find mercifulnes, that when he
shall come eftesones to judge the quick and the dead on high above in the
clouds, When the time of refreshing comes.
whom his father once sent simple and poor for your sakes, ye may be able
constauntly to abide his presence, which shall be terrible to them, and
intolerable, which has not be penitent. But such as for this mean space
do believe in Jesus name, whom the prophets has many years a go publyshed to
you, and whom we also according to their prophecies, bear witness of, and
submit themselfes to him by faith, puttyng their sin away by penance, shall
find there with the righteous judge, (who has promised to all men for faith
in him, and repentance of sin everlasting health) refreshing. All those
things are come hitherto well to pass, which, as the prophets has
heretofore told, were for to be dooen and performed. And it is not to be
doubted but God will perform all the rest also, which he has promised as
faithfully. Jesus Christ shall come again, but by and by shall not he come
again. For the gospel and chereful tidinges from god must be preached over
all the world before his cumming: In the mean while lives he in all glory,
sits and reigns in high heavens above, until that prescript time, whereof
the Prophets, Iohel has spoken and Malachie, when all things shall come by
restitucion again and be made up, and all at a point perfectly finished
which god has spoken of, by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, as many as
has been since the beginning of the world. For of this one person have al
they prophesied.

Moses is with you of authority most ancient, for under his proteccyon, as
under your chief guide and capitain, ye left Egypt, ye traueled through
wilderness, ye received the law, but yet a promise made he to you of this
Jesus of Nazareth whom ye have flayne speaking after this manier to the
fathers in his book of Deuteronomii: a prophet shall the lord your god reyse
up unto you, even from among your brethren like unto me: him shall ye hear, in
all that he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass, that what soul
soever shall not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.
Now do ye acknowelage this prophecye of Moses, recognize ye the true Moses,
knowledge ye that Jesus Christ was borne of David's lineage, of the trybe of
Judah, in the City of Bethelem, according to the prophets sayings. By this
your guide and captain, god calls you out of bondage, to that liberty
which always shall endure: by this capitayn has he disclosed a new law
supernal and evangelical, and by this person he offers remission of all
sins and life everlasting. Moses would that all men should hear him: each
man hears, that in him believes. What person soever shall believe in him shall
be saved, who that refuses to believe, shall be banished out of the feloweship,
and out of the name of the Israelites, and shall peryshe with out all recovery.
For without faith in Jesus Christ, no hope there is of salvation.

If you give faith to Moses, than must ye heartily love Jesus, whom he has
so highly commended to you in his prophecy. Neither has Moses alone thus
prophesied of Jesus, but all the Prophets also, from Samuels time until John
the baptist, has prophesied, describing his nativity, doctrine, miracles,
punyshmentes, infamy, death on the cross, his buryinge, and resurreccion, his
going up to heaven, and the sending forth of the holy ghost, upon all that
believes, which things every one are euidentlye come to pass, the spreading
of the gospel over all the world abroad, and the glorious cumming of the
lord again at the end of the world.

But if that ye in very deed be the prophets children, whereof ye auaunte your
selfs, not without a cause, have ye than no distruste in their promyses: if ye
be the children of the patriarchs, which were the chief fathers of all your
auncestry, understand ye and perceive that to you pertayneth the covenant and
promise that god made to Abraham, saying: through thy sede shall all the nations
of the world be blessed. This blessing performed not he in Isaac, for he is
dead, and to life is not he come again, but in Jesus of Nazareth, whom Isaac
in figure represented, offrynge himself up in sacrifice willyngly, like as
Christ obeying his father, was offered as a sacrifyce on the cross. This is
that seed of Abraham, whereby shall not only all Israelites, but all nations
also of the world, if they believe the gospel, be delivered of the curse
which is due for sin, and obtain therwithal this blessing, that after they
have once received the holy ghost they may be called the children of the
living God. Wherefore the promise that god made unto Abraham, perteyneth
undoubtedly to all nations of the world, yet that not withstanding, his
pleasure was to have you thus honorably preferred, that his promise should
first of all be proffered to you, and that he would according to Moses
prophecy, raise one up of your nation, and send to you no mean prophet, but
his own only son Jesus, that should disclose this blessyng, which god
promised to Abraham. This is than that blessing that every person obeying the
word of the gospel, may utterly forsake all vice and naughty living, and
frankely confess Jesus to be the author of man's salvation.

The.iiii. Chapter.

While Peter that heavenly Orator, and John his fellow in office with him, were
occupied in these and such other Oracions, exhortyng the people to embrace the
gospel, without color of flattery toward any manne, enducyng them to the
knowledge of the truth by witness of Prophets, sometimes making them
afraid with dreadfulnes of the great Judgment that was to come, eftesones
appeasyng them, and pleasauntly intreatyng, by means of an easy way to come
by pardon, even than ready at hand, and for the certayntye that was in the
promise of their salvation, suddenly there came upon them the pryestes, and
rewlers of the temple, accompanied also with Sadduces, who caused them to
break of in the mids their wholesome communication. The pryestes and rulers
felt themselves in this point agreued, that men of the laity, unlearned,
should bear rule in the temple, and teach the people, where none else ought to
speak but doctors of the law, Phariseis, and Scribes, and in that also they
were offended, that so honorably they spoke of Jesus, whom they for a gyltie
person had put to death, whose name to abolyshe, was their earnest desire and
study. But of all other things, that set the Sadduces on fire against the
apostles, because they stycked not openly to publyshe that Jesus was risen from
death to life, and to promise, that al men through him, should rise again. For
the Sadduces believe another angel to be, nor soul on live, after they be once
separate from the body. Wherefore they could in no wise abide any rehersall of
resurrection. Here does now the wicked busshoppes eftsoon make assault
against the ghospel, which thing Jesus had told before to his disciples
should come to pass. And preached in Jesus the resurrection from death
But like as man's malice, the more it wrastled and strove against Christ,
the more it set forth his glory and renoume, even so the more they did rebel
against the preachers of his gospel, the more vehemently brast out the
strength thereof and virtue. But now what do they? They reason not with the
apostles, but lay fast hands upon them, forth away they hale them to prison
for a time, that they might be forth cummyng the next morrow. For than was
euentyde at hand. The cruel and mischeuouse priests were ready in will even
there furthwith to have slain Jesus disciples, but for fear on the other
part, of the people, they stayghed their hands, and imagined the mean time
some coulourable pretense of that cursed act, that they might appear to
bring about their pretensed purpose, lawfully. But as they malice could naught
preuyale against Christ, until the time was come that he himself was
contented to dye, so in like manner was their conspiracy naught able to do
against Christ's disciples, before the day came that the father of heaven had
prescribed to each of them. For Christ's power was with his Apostles. And yet
was not that sermon which these two apostles made, (though it were
interrupted by the priests,) without condign fruit. For many that heard the
Apostles preach, were thereby persuaded to believe.

Than was the net increased, the little grain of Mustarde sede was stretched
out in the breadth, the leven of the gospel scattered abroad his virtue, in
sundry parts. For the faithful at that time amounted to the noumbre of five
thousand men. Note that the gospel is a thing accepted commonly and favored
of the mean people, seldom does the nobles of the world, well agree with
it. Note also the success of the gospel. The chief of all and capitaines
most excellent, are led to prison. Neither stryued they again their guydes,
nor any trouble made the people thereat, which were taught naught else, but to
obey Christ, and to put their trust in him.

On the morrow, the wicked counsel assembled together, no where in one consent
of minds, but to put Jesus to death, and the truth to oppress. The priests
and temple rulers, the elders and auncientes of the people, with the Scribes of
Jerusalem, assembled in one place together. Besides these, came Annas thither,
the high bishop, and Cayphas in one confederacy with him, by reason of
aliaunce: moreover John and Alexandre, the chief at that time among the
priests. And finally, as many as were of the priests kindred, among whom the
higher that each manne was at that time in authority, the more was he
mischievous. But well it does appear of this their busy and paynfull
diligence, that it was no common or small matter, which they so carefully
labored to stente. For what should the matter mean that all they should be
afraid of a few persons, men unknown, out of reputacion, unlearned, yea the
disciples of a condemned person, And when they had set them before them they
asked, by what power or in what name have ye done this:
which was crucified? But forth were brought both Peter and John, and for
guilty persons, before them were they presented. What simple person and
unlearned, would not be abashed at the sight of so great an assembly, and in
authority so honorable: first sat down the stout stately bishops and
priests, with them the head men of their religyon: than next to them the
rewlers of the temple, afterward the elders among the people, each thing there
was done with solemn authority. Even than considered the apostles with
themselves, the cruel and unrighteous judgments that they had used toward
their master Jesus.

And yet for all that, stood they in countenance clear and vndismayed. Their
Lord undoubtedly and their master Jesus, had told them before that all these
things should betyde them, and had armed their minds stowtely to stand
against such casual adversity. Here again mark me well and example of that
judgment, that Jesus himself was condemned by. Upon the demand of a
question, was Christ taken. And here likewise enquired they, as concerning the
creple that was healed: by what authority, or in whose name do ye this? This
question might they have asked in the temple, before they brought them to
prison, this thing might they have learned as the people did: for Peter
declared the cause of this fact evidently. But liefer had they to pyke a
quarrel with them. And as for the truth, afterward passed they nothing upon:
but sought occasion to work them displeasure. A token this was, that their
order of priesthood should within a short while have an end, seeing that they,
both faulty and vicious, had naught else to defend their authority, but
counselles of conspiracy, prysons, and soondrye kinds of death.

Than Peter full of the holy ghost, said unto them: Ye rewlers of the people,
and elders of Israel, if we this day be examined of the good deed that we
have done to the sick man, by what means he is made whole: Be it known unto
you al, and to al ye people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of
Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised again from death: even by him*
does this man here stand present before you, woole. This is the stone which
was cast aside of you buylders, which is become the chief of the corner.
Neither is there salvation in any other. For among men under heaven, there is
given none other name, wherein we must be saved. Now what does Peter in this
case, he that thryse before with an oath denied his master, at the
threatninges of a little poor wenche, being servant? Does he tremble for
fear? Is he, as one that lacks his right wits, dismayed? Or cannot he
speak? No none of al these. What than? he undoubtedly was framed after an
other sort. For while Peter lived after his own will and fantasy, he sticked
not to ^^ake and promise of himself very largely and shortly after renneth
he away, and falsely forswereth himself, all promyses which he before had
unadvisedly made, clean forgotten: but in this place constantly, as one
replenished with the holy ghost, reasoned he his cause, without any
deliberation, fully to an end: temperyng his tale with woondrefull wisdom,
in such sort, that neither his free talk was to any man reprochefull,
neither of his soft and ientle speech appeared any fear to be in him or
flattery, but his endeavor was with all his well decked eloquence, this to
persuade, that Jesus was the author of man's salvation.

Than Peter's words that he spoke to them, were these: ye that are princes,
the Rulers of the people, and elders, give ear unto me: trewly much marvel
had I wherefore and why we were commanded to pry^on, seeing that we know of
none haynouse crime that we committed, and because princes are not wont to
impryson men, but for their wicked doings. Now if (...) have no crime, as I
can hear, to bring in against us, neither any mischeuous deed to lay to our
charge, but that ye will examyne us of a good turn which this man has gotten
being now whole and sound, who was before weak, and shronke together, I will
not stycke to declare to you the cause and manner thereof. For it belongs to
our office gently to make accoumpte or declaration of Christ's faith, to all
that be desyrouse to learn. Wherefore, be ye all well assured of this, not only
ye that are the chief and head men, but all ye also which be the commons of
Israel, (for the doctrine that we teach pertayneth to al men's salvation,
whether they be princes, and of the nobility, or else of the comminaltie,) that
this man, whom ye see stand by us in lymmes both whole and sound, who was
wont before, as it is not unknown to you, to be carried of porters, now has
obtained this benefit of health, neither by magikes art, nor by man's power,
neither yet through our deservings, but by invocation of ye Lord Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, whom ye, but few days ago, upon sentence given of Ponce Pilate,
nailed fast upon the cross. But God has raised him from death, and freely
given him rule over all, in life everlasting. Therefore the strength and virtue
of his name, works now effectually the same thing in healyng men and saving
them, that he himself was wunte here on earth, to work. No doubt, this is
it, that the Prophet David heretofore spoke in his psalm of a stone that man
should reiecte, but God should see it highly exalted. This Jesus of Nazareth
is the very same stone, which ye in buyldyng of your Synagogue, refused. From
the which buyldyng ye threw him away, as an outcaste, but God has made him
the head corner stone, to hold straight together, by his divine strength and
power, the whole church, which is for to be set up and builded, both of
Jews and Gentiles. For this persons sake, our father of heaven profereth all
men salvation, and there is no hope at all for any manne to be saved, but
through Jesus. I know well that Moses, the patriarchs, and prophets, are in
holy and ancient authority with you. But so was it thought good to the
father of heaven, that his son alone should work all men's salvation,
whereof he would him to be called Jesus. Any other name have not we already
under heaven, nor in time to come shall have, whereby we must be saved. Than
have ye no cause to marvel that this creple was hable so much to obtain, at
thinuocatio^ of this name, seeing that he has worthily merited and deserved
health everlasting, for all persons that calls upon him.

When Peter had spoken these words, as many as were in that counsel,
beholding both in Peter and John, free courage and stedfastnes of mind, which
appeared to their very countenance: and perceyuyng also, that they were of the
comens, men unlearned, wundered greatly whereupon they should bear themselves
so bold, how they came by such eloquence, and so perfyte understanding of
the prophets. In conclusion, they came into remembrance of them* how they
had kept company with Jesus, whom they theymselues knew certainly to be
slain of envy. They were in a great perplexity, by reason that they, being of
the base sort of men, and unlearned, were so bold spirited, and so free of
^ong and liberal, who neither for the deadly pains which their master
suffered, neither for the honor and authority of so famous assembly, were
troubled any thing at all in mind. They beheld the man himself present, well
known with all the people, who being borne notably lame, than might walk
cherefully. Suddenly was this miracle wrought, not in any secret place, but
before the temple door, not by magikes art, but at the inuocacion of Jesus
name, whom they supposed dead. The fact was so evident, that they could not
well deny it. And occasion had they none to find fault with them. For what is
more worthy the favorable report of many, than to make a wretched lame
creature whole without reward. None answer therefore make they to ye
apostles, for naught had they to answer: as for that which was already
done, they could not disprove, and to allow the same, they would not.
Wherefore upon commandment given to the apostles, that they with the healed
person also, should depart out of their assembly, they fell in consultacion,
and laid their heads together, saying: what shall we do with these men
although but rude and rascal? for why? This notable miracle which was set
forth by them, is better known withal that dwell in Jerusalem, then we shall be
ha^le to disafirme. If we deny the fact, we shall gain us naught else thereby,
but shame, and dishonestie: if we condemn and punyshe them, we shall seem
void of all mercy, and clean without justice, and the more shall we stir
up the people against us. There is none other counsel for us to take, but some
more quiet way must we follow, and provide that this evil (how soever it
has sprung) creape no further abroad, neither be published among the people.
For all such manner sores, or points of infeccio^, when they are once sprung
in a cominaltie, be wont, if a man vex and anger them, to wax stronger, and
with a violent rage further to go abroad, than if they were made light of.

It seems therefore a good way for us, to hold of our hands from them, but
let us make them afraid with sharp and cruel threatenings, Let us threaten
and charge them. etc.
that they make from henceforth no mention of Jesus name to no man on live,
whether he be Jew, or of any other nation. This their counsel, which was as
folyshe as might be spoken, pleased all the whole assembly, and every man with
one assent, agreed thereto. For than had they perceived that the apostles were
valiant of courage, and would not alter or change their minds. They
perceived likewise, that this miracle was not unknown to all the people, they
were not to learn that Jesus name was with them of no small efficacy, and for
man's health a present remedy. How could they than for shame commau^d, or what
hope had they to have that name kept under, specially seeing they might through
the selfsame name, attain unto eternal salvation? Such verily are the
counsels of princes, of Bishops, priests and of other the chief of the
comminaltie, as often as they gather their assemblyes together, by policy of
man's wit. Sometime there be among them, which can plainly see what
does well agree with good reason, but yet they perceive in following of
the same, some loss should ensue of their renown, decay of riches, or some
other such like incommoditie.

When each of them had well allowed this decree, they called in the apostles,
it was declared to them in name of the whole counsel, that they should teach
no man on live, Jesus doctrine: ne make in any wise mention of his name, either
by stelth unawares to them, ne yet in hearing of any multitude, neither openly,
ne privily at home, or else abroad. O the folyshe wisdom of the world, they
could not keep him in his grave when he was dead, and now go they about to
bury or suppress the name, which is wunte always after death, to be better
known. Peter and John, after the counsels decree was rehearsed them with
solemn authority, made this answer thereunto very constauntly, but without
any word spoken to man's rebuke: Judge ye your selves that know the law,
whether it be well before God that we should be more obedient to you, than to
Gods commandment. God has heretofore said by the mouth of his Prophets,
that it should even thus come to pass, Christ the son of God thus
commanded us, and so likewise that heavenly spirit, whom he promised us to
send down from his father, infourmeth us secretly, and puts into our
minds, that we should for all men's salvation, publyshe the name of our lord
Jesus Christ, bearyng witness also to that that we have seen and heard. If ye
mind to be of an upright judgment, ye also will submit your selves to the
will of God. If not, whatsoever ye decree of us, truly we may not otherwise do,
than speak that we saw with our iyes, what we heard with our ears, and that
God, who ought to be above all men obeyed, would have preached abroad to all
men. When the counsel had heard of them this answer, so wisely made, and
franckly, they went naught else about, but to make them sore afraid with
threatenings. Alas, a counsel without all hope of recovery, they have no
argument to persuade: no reasons or causes, why they should rebuke: neither
testimonies they have of scripture, wherwithall to teach. Their whole
authority is but threatninges. O the wicked conscience always fearful. Their
desire was to punish the innocents, a malicious will was ready in them, but
they being as they were, princes, yet were afraied of their simple poor
subjects, me^ in public office, in dread of pryuate persons, many in
number, in fear of few, yea men defensed, of them that were unarmed, men of
learning, of men unlearned: as for thapostles had neither any retinewe nor
guard for their defense, nor bands of noble estate assured to them. But lords
they were of that, that no yearthly power was hable to give, So threatened they
the^ and let the^ go. etc.
as to make the lame at the name of Jesus Christ, to arise and walk. To do
man good, thapostles were in power myghtie, but as touching hurt they were
void of all strength. And so were the apostles for that time dimissed of that
counsel, being charged with their sore threatenynges. Yet had not the chief
counselors cast of their ca^kred malice, but differred it in mind to get
afterward some other occasion. For they could find no way to punish them,
and that because of the people, whom they feared, having no regard in
themself at all to god. For all men highly praised them, as touching that
miracle which was done, in healyng the lame criple. And each manne noted it
the more, because the person in whom this miracle was wrought, was above
fowertie years of age. So was he borne, and thus many years set forth this
beggar to the open sight of the world, his infirmity, so that no man could
accuse or find fault with their doings, as though his impediment had be
counterfeite, or else some light or small deformity not worthy consideracion.

Than Peter and John being dispatched of the counsel, returned to their
company, being than in their high parlour altogether careful in mind what
end should come of that consultacion which was in hand, and rehearsed to
them in order all the whole matter, what the princes had laid to their charge,
and of the answer that they had made thereunto. The inward true love that each
one bare to other, replenyshed their hearts upon these tidings told them,
with excedyng Joy. The disciples were glad that the chief and pieres of all
thapostles were dimyssed. And when they heard^ that, they lift up their voices
to God with one accord.
Thapostles on the other part reioysed in the bount^ousnes of their lord, by
whom his disciples attained unto such joy.

God after this manner and sort tempereth all things in his servants, so
that with sorrow he mingleth joy, to the end that they may be hable patiently
to suffer, and endure adversity, and that they on the other side may for
gladsome things, render hertie thanks, and in heaviness pray unto the Lord.
After the whole company had than heard the apostles tale, they spoke aloude
with one assente unto the Lord, of whose goodness the gospel had begone to
have right good success, and said: Lord God omnipotent, that made through
thy word, heaven, earth, the sea, and whasoeuer is in them contained, whose
most blessed will no power of man is able to withstand: whose eternal
decrees, no man's conspiracy is hable to empayre, for all that now we see here
brought to pass, thy blessed spirit has spoken of before, by the mouth of
thy faithful servant David our Patryarche, saying: Why do the heathen rage
and the people imagine vain things? The kings of the earth stand up, and
the princes has gathered themselves together against the Lord, and against
his Christ: All we recognize truth in this prophecy. For what he saw to
come, being than enspired with thy holy spirit: that see we both done in very
deed, and the doing of the same.

For in this city which professes holiness, both Herod, and Ponce Pilate
yearthly princes, with the heathen, and people of Israel, gathered themselves
together, against the master and captain of all holiness, thy holy child
Jesus, whom thou haste enoyncted with an heavenly oynctment, forecastyng with
their wicked counsel, to bring those things to pass, which thou of thy
power invincible, and eternal decree, had determined to be done for the
salvation of man. But whosoever conspireth against thy son Jesus, sent down
from the, he conspireth against the. And behold a great assembly of the chief
rulers, are cum eftsoon together, to conspire against the holy and blessed
name of thy son Jesus. But like as thou dyddest reyse Jesus from death being
slain of them, and advanced him to heavens, as partener of thy kingdom,
dysapoyntyng them of their purposes, even so see now unto their threatening,
that they in no wise prevail, but strength and courage thy servants, that
they may with most steadfast boldness, vttre the gospel, which is not man's
word, but thy word, that is to say, brought down from thee to earth, by
thy son for all our sakes: and like as thy miracle in making whole the lame
creple, allured many to profess the name of Jesus, and feared the princes,
which were all bent in conspiracy against his glory, even so vouchesafe to
aid them now in time to come, with thy almyghtye power, that by means of
healyng, and workyng of wondrefull miracles through the holy name of thy son
Jesus, And as soon as they had made their prayer the place moved where they were
etc.
the glory of thy gospel may the clearer shine and further abroad, while
they that rebel against the and thy son, do rage all in vain.

When they had thus made their prayer with one accord, the place where they
together stood, trembled. Which thing betokens that their prayer was
graciousl^ heard with the lord, an^ their desire ratified. For there is
nothing so effectual, as is the prayer of the church in one whole consent.

Uerely it ought to be of no small strength and power, that was hable to shake
the earth which is not of it self mouable. This was no void token, for the
lively strength of the holy ghost was forthwith in the^ all renewed and
augmented, And they were filled with the holy ghost, and they spoke the words
of God boldly.
in so much that they would not for all such threatenings as the princes made,
concele and hyde the gospel, but preached the name of their master Jesus
more stedfastely, and more frankely, yea more of them also in number than
before. For such is the nature of the gospel as touching his increase, that
like as Safron and other things many more come forth, although they be ill
handeled, more plenteously: even so aryseth up the gospel against the
assaults of the world, and the sooner by wrastelyng therewith, overcomes
the same. The faithful that professed the name of Jesus, amounted than within
few days to a woondrefull great number.

And yet that thou may understand how this their consent of minds came
not of man's policy, among so many together in one company, there was no
ambicion at all, no envy, no brawlyng, no stryuyng, but in such conformity of
mind and peaceable quietness of heart were they all, as a m^nne would have
thought them all, to be of one heart and one mind. For than was each man at a
point with himself no longer to follow his own mind, which is in all sorts
of men so diverse, that uneath a man may find two brothers germane, that can
agree betwixt themselves. But as for this company, Jesus was the ruler of them
all by his own blessed spirit. From thence proceeded that so great a consent
of so many persons together, one unlike an other, either in kindred, age, or
worldely substance, insomuche that not only those things were commen
amongst them, which each man is wont to depart one to other, without loss
to the geuer, of the which manner things, be learning, counsel, admonicion,
consolacion and exhortacion, but temporal possessions also, which are
communicate to other, not without damage or loss to the possessour, and
therefore scarcely may a man find any, that can be content to be in this point
liberal. But such things amongst them all were so common, that no man would
somuche as once challenge any thing of all that he possessed, for his own.
Wherefore he that gave any of his own goods, looked for no thanks at their
hands that received the same, because he thought all that was given, to be his
own propre good, that had need of it, and himself a robber and no just
person, if he should withholde any thing, that his brothers necessity
required. But the apostles, which were as chief pieres of this new city,
being dispurueyed of worldely goods, but rich in gifts of the holy ghost,
augmented their company every day more than other, bearyng wytnes of our Lord
Jesus Christ's resurreccion, with wonderful great steadfastness of mind, and
mighty power in workyng of miracles. For his resurreccion was pryncipally to be
persuaded by witness of miracles. For many one at his death had been present,
and not a few had been pryuy to his burial. And so lived this new
comminaltie under right valyaunte Capitaynes, having abundance of all
things, for what they lacked in goods, was supplied and borne out, with
mutual love and concord. For although many one were poor, yet was there none
amongst them that lacked. For as many as were possessioners, either of lands,
or houses made sale of them, and brought ye price thereof, and laid it at the
Apostles feet, that they whom reverently as fathers they regarded, might
distribute the same goods in common, at their own pleasure. Finally there was
no less vpryghtnes amongst them, that dealed the price of men's possessions,
then was with those which brought it. Truth and vpryght dealyng is seldom
found among stewardes of household, and layers out of money. But here was that
distribucion made among them, according to every man's necessity, without any
choice had of persons.

There was in this company, And distribucion was made unto every man according
as he had need.
one Joseph, whom the apostles by syrname called Barnabas, which word in
the Sirians tongue betokens son of comfort, by blood and auncestry, a
Leuyte, borne in Cipres. This Joseph because he did excel among other in great
gifts, and qualities of the mind, by reason whereof he was called Barnabas,
for the joyful comfort that the multitude had of his access, was an example
for many to follow that lyberali^ie, which was semely for the ghospel. For
whereas he had land in Cypres, he sold it, and brought the price thereof, and
laid it at the Apostles feet, as though it had been a vile thing and worthy
to be despised. But yet were the Apostles of such holiness, that they would
take nothing thereof for them selves, above other.

The.v. Chapter.

BUt like as Barnabas plain truth without colorable deceit, moved many to
follow his lyberalitie, so was here an example to put al people in fear, that
in matters of spiritual charge, one should not deceive an other. For the holy
ghost loves playnes of heart, and hates al deceit and dissimulacion. In
like manner Judas among the twelve Apostles, was an example, that no man should
put affiaunce in himself, but that each manne should with all careful
diligence, continewe in doing his duty.

A certyne man named Ananias. etc
There was of this company, a certain man called Ananias, one far unlike
unto his own name, because he thoroughly not consented to the gracious favor
of God. This Ananias had a wife called Saphira, not unlike unto the housbande.
When that Ananias, more ambicious of honor, the^ desirous of perfect
holiness, saw diverse persons hyghly commended of all men, for their free
and sincere lyberalitie, he sold his land: and laid up part of the money,
his wife being pryuy thereunto and allowing the same, that of the two parts,
wherein his money was divided, the one should purchase him praise of the
people, with an estimation also or fame of holiness, the other would he keep
for himself, if any need should happen, distructing doubtless the holy
ghost, and more caring or providing for himself then for the whole company of
his brethren, rekenyng thus with himself: if other dye for hunger, I am
sufficiently provided for. Such forecasting was not besemyng a man that should
put his whole affiance in Christ, who promised that they should want
nothing, that seeks for the kingdom of god and the rightwysenes thereof:
neither was this imaginacion mete for him which should be of one will with
other, and of one mind. When he had brought to the apostles feet, part of
the money, Ananias, how is it that Satan has filled thine heart that thou
should lie unto ye holy ghost. etc.
that his liuelode was sold for, Peter understanding by inspiracion of the
holy ghost, which was in him aboundauntly, the man's ungodly dissimulacion,
said: Ananias, where as thou have once dedicate thy self to the holy ghost,
and seen his power by so many tokens evidently declared, why have thou suffered
the devil now eftesones to put this in thy mind, to take by stelth away,
part of that money, which thou receyuedst for thy lyuelode, as though thou
could face down the holy ghost with a lie, who can in nowyse be deceived,
and to bring into this company such a presidente, most daungerouse? If we
had constrained thee to sell thy liuelode against thy will, some cause
peradventure it might have been for to dissemble, now sense thou did this
of thine own free will, which thou haste done, to what purpose auayled it to
deface that thing with hypocryse, which should have been to other an example
of liberality? Might not thou have kept thy land in thine own hand, if
thou would? and moreover, after thou had sold it, could not thou
have reserved the money wholly unto thy self? They for their truth and plain
dealyng, are well commended, which of their own free will, brings forth all
that they have. For we enforce no man thus to do, if he be not willing to
the same. Upon what occasion than have thou stablyshed in thy mind, thus to
disse^ble in this matter? It is not man that thou have made this lie unto, but
almighty god. If thou think that god may be deceived, thine opinion of him,
is false and ungodly. But if thou believe that he is pryuie to all things,
either thou despisest his righteousness, or else thou thynkest that he
favors falsehood. When Ananias heard these words, he fell down, and gave
up the ghost. etc.
Ananias than perceiving that thapostles knew his falsehood, suddenly fell
down, as one that had be stricken to the heart with a sharp rebuke, and
yielded up the ghost. One for an example suffered death, that many might be
thereby preserved. For after that this fact was bruted abroad, it made many
sore afraid, that none durst enterprise any such like offense against the
holy ghost: Young men removed thence the dead corse, and when they had carried
it forth, buried it.

He deserved not to be buried, yet ought he thence to be removed, lest his dead
body should infecte that pure and holy company. Here peradventure some will
marvel at Peter's sharpnes toward Ananias, that but late before so ^entily
entreated them, that had crucified Christ, to receive pardon for their
offenses, ascribyng all that was done to ignorance, and proferyng the penytent
person, health of soul everlasting. But here rebuked he this person so
sharply for witholdyng a small portion of money, contrary to his lyberall
promise, that there was no hope at all for him to come by pardone. For why?
Jesus the Lord, that had given commandment for all men to be called by mean
of baptism, to their salvation, pardonyng their offenses, would teach by the
example of violent death in a few persons, how much the offense is more
grievous to fall in sin after baptysme, and light received of the gospel,
not now of any unadvisedness or ignorance, but of a wilful dissimulacion. And
Peter knew that the most pestilent plague that the plain simplicity of the
gospel could have, should spring of dissimulacio^ and avarice, and therefore
even at the beginning of the church, a notable example was openly set forth,
to admonish all people, ye none should escape, whosoever followed the steps
of Ananias, the vengeance of god, although that his offense were not in this
world forthwith punished. As for the loss of the money, was not here rekened
upon, but his mystrust in God, and mocking of his holy spirit. Peter himself
punished not the person, but for his souls health sharply he rebuked him. But
because he neither brast out into weeping, nor expressed any word at all of
repentance, God took vengeance on him.

And thus of gods wonderful mercy toward manne, one was stricken, that
many might be saved. An example of justice was set forth toward him that
dyed, and mercy besides was largely powered out on many one that took heed, at
his example, to eschew sin.

And as it were about the space of three hours after, behold the wife of
Ananias, not knowing what had chanced to her housband, (as folks know later
almost then other, what evil is done at home in their own house,) came in,
being privy to that her housbandes crafty deceyte, and in will ready also for
her part, to get vain praise: unto whose ungodly imaginacions, Peter
answered, saying: tell me woman, sold ye the land for so much, and for no
more then this? She much like to her housbande, answered without any shame,
Than Peter said unto her: why have ye agreed together to tempte the spirit of
the lord etc.
yea verayly for somuche have we sold it. Than Peter said to her: why have
thou with thy housbande together agreed to tempte with a lie, not us, but the
spirit of the lord, whom ye see workyng in us? But forasmuch as it liked
thee to be fellow with thy housbande in this wicked dissimulacion, thou shall
be like wise partener with him in punishment.

Behold they stand at the door, which buried thy housbande, and the self
same persons shall carry the out. She than immediately as these words were
spoken, fell down and yielded up the ghost: In went the young men upon
the same, and found the woman dead. Than they carried her forth, and buried
her by her housbande. A sharp example this was, but yet profitble for manne,
and not ofter put in ure, than once of thapostles. And yet did not Peter, the
ientileste creature that than was living, inflycte this punishment, but as he
that was inspired with the holy ghost, expressed it in words. For Peter than
knew by secret inspiracion of the holy ghost, what was already done, and what
was for to be done. God to whom all things be known, will see the^ punished,
that under colored falsehood, do mock apostolyke persons, though that they
be such, as may be deceived. For all men has not all times that gift of the
holy ghost, that Peter had at that time. Now mark how happily of an evil
occasion it succeeded. Wondrefull great fear sprang through the whole Church
of the faithful, by means of that death which these twoe persons right
woorthyly suffered, yea, other also that than believed not, were stricken with
fear of this example.

Moreover many and great miracles, were wrought among the people by the
apostles, whereby it might plainly appear to all men, that this notable effect
came to pass by some dyuine power, above al strength of man. And as many as
sticked to the gospel, abode all with one accord together in the porche, And
of the others durst no man join himself to the^.
called Salomons porche. For than were not they desyrouse to be hyd in corners,
but the time required, that the candle being set upon the candlestick,
should give light to all that entered into the house. As for the others, which
had not yet by baptysme booked themselves as soldiers, to fight under the
baner of Christ's captain, none durst company with them. For they perceived
this sort of people to be dedicate to God, and holy, and therefore of a
certain reverent fear, withdrewe themselves from their company, like as the
temporal sort of men are wont to draw back from hallowed things, which
be for ever dedicate to the temple. For the people hated them not, but had them
in an honorable reverence, for the excellent virtue or gifts of god, which
clearly shone in them. And notwithstanding that the example of Ananias and
Saphira had made many one sore afraid, that none durst frame themselves after
a counterfeyte fashion unto their coumpanie, Nevertheless the people magnifyed
them.
yet after this the multitude of the faithful increased every day, in number
more and more, both of men and women, insomuche that commonly they would bring
forth the sick folks into the streets, and such as were not able to go on
foot by reason of great sickness, those set they out abroad upon couches and
beds, that against Peter's cu^myng, his shadow as he passed by might at the
leastwyse ouershadowe some of them. Ueraily in them was that promise
performed, which Jesus the Lord had made, speaking thus of his disciples:
and greater things than these be, shall they do. Jesus healed some persons
by touching the hemme of his garment* but no man healed he by touching of his
shadow. The fame of their miracles, spread every day ferther abroad, insomuche
that a great multitude of people, came out of the cities bordering nigh there
about, unto Jerusalem, bryngyng with them, those that were is sundry wise
diseased, and troubled of unclean spirits, which were made whole euerychone.
In such a wondrefull success of things mete, it were for us to observe how
sobre and demure the Apostles were at all times, who claymed no renoume or
glory for their doings, but referred all praise that was given them to the
name of their master Jesus.

After that the name of Jesus Christ began in this manner to be known
wonderfully well with all men, and the sweet odor of the ghospel, to spread
it self every day farther abroad: Bishop Annas a prelate of false religion,
could not abide the increase of this true religion. Besides all other, namely
they that were of the Saduceis sect, took his part, forbycause the Apostles
bear witness pryncypally of our master Jesus Christ's resurrection. Which
thing caused the Phariseis, that defended the resurrection against the
Saduceis, to be more quiet toward the Apostels. It had before been decreed,
that this business, should be laid on sleep, by dissemblyng thereat for a
time. But maliciouse envy go^te the upper hand of this their decree or
counsel, and furyousnesse in them, shook of all fear. For the head priests,
whose mind Satan troubled with envy, being assisted with the Saduceis, set
hand on the apostels, and had them to ward, laying them in no private prison,
as though they should be examyned upon suspicion, but in a common prison, as
though they had be taken in some manifest act of myschiefe. A prison was
chos^n out very strong, And they laid hands on the Apostles, and put them
in the (...) prison.
lest they might by some mean escape, or else be taken away through some
commocion of the poeple. But the holy word of the gospel, can neither be
bounden, ne kept in prison by man's wit and policy. For Jesus, who is the
defendour of his own elected, sen^e his Angel, that opened by night the
prison doors, and brought them forth and said: be ye nothing unquieted in
mind with these maliciouse priests, but rather hold on the holder, as ye
have begone. Go your way, and in the temple step up and preach to the
people, what soever he gave you in commandment to preach to all nations of
the world. The time was once, when he would not suffer you to publishe him for
Christ. But now is cumme the time, that he spoke of to you, saying: there is
nothing hyd that shall not be openly showed, and what is whispered in your
ear, that preach ye upon the house tops. The apostles being encouraged at
this the angels exhortacio^, came into the temple early in the morning, and
according to their accustomed manier, taught the people, which were many there
in number. The high bishop being ignorant what was done by night of the
angel, joined himself in confederacy with the Saduceis, and certain other
supporters of that wilful mind that he was of, and came into the counsel
house. Thither was called all the whole counsel of prestes, of officers and
temple rulers, with all the whole order of elders among the people of Israel.
For than were they all the sorer incensed against them for their disobedience,
and had determined to ordeyne some crueller punishemente for them: But here
consider in the mean while, good reader, the malicious impudency of the
priests, that where as they had no just matier to lay to the Apostles charge,
yet brought they about in their great assembly, what ever they lusted: because
their sentence, which was cursed and ungodly, should appear in that, that it
was decreed by consent of the whole counsel, good and ryghteous. After that
the head men were set down each one in his place after a stately manier, the
sergeauntes were sent, to bring forth thattached persons before them, into
their sessions.

The sergeauntes came unto the prison, they found the kepers watchyng at the
prison door. The door was set open. But when they were come in, none of the
apostles could they find, nor any prynt or token, what way they had escaped.
Than went the ministers back again unto the counsel, and told them what
they had seen. We found, said they, the prison on every side surely shut,
and the kepers standing fast by the door. But when the door was open and we
let in, no man found we there. All they were much troubled in their minds at
these tidings, and specially the temple rewlers and the head pryestes, and as
men being at their wits end, dowted sore what end should ensue of this
business.

The mean time that they were in such doubt, whiles they were trembling for
fear in their consultacion, in came one ye troubled more their minds with
heavy tidings, saying: behold, the men that ye emprysoned yesterday, now
stand in the temple, teaching no small noumber of people. Than the
templerewlers, because it perteyned peculiarlye to their office to see that
nothing should be other wise done in the temple then ought to be, took their
way, according to the priests commandment, unto the temple, with a company
of serving men, for their guard against all assaults or violence of the
people: They found them like as it was reported, And they brought the^ without
violence.
standing in the temple, and preaching Jesus to a great sort of people. Albeit
they laid no hands on them, like as they had done before. For they saw there
present a great number of people, For they feared the people, etc.
and were afraid themselves lest they, if any commocion should have risen
among the people, should be stoned. But neither was that company of such a
sort, that would make business, neither thapostles those persons, that desired
aid of any temporal power. They were in themselves very steadfast and sobre
in their doings, without any fearsenes at all. They beheld thofficers which
led them the day before to prison. And yet for all that, they neither feared
themselves, neither fled away, nor brake once of their preaching of the
ghospel, until the offycer of the temple entreated them gently, to go unto
the counsel. The Apostles obeyed, lest they should in any wise seem to
despise the public authority. For their master had not taught them that they
should when they were called, refuse to go, but yt they should boldly speak,
nothing at all afraid. In came these two fyshers to the counsel house,
presented they were before a company of high and great officers, with no small
train following them. Than began Annas, the high priest with high authority,
and no less statelines of mind, his oracion in this manner: did not we
straightly command you at our last assembly by authority of ye high powers
that ye should no more teach the people, nor make mention privily nor appartly
to any man, straungier or Jew, Behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your
doctrine.
of this name Jesus, which we will shall be abolyshed?

And now will ye see how contemptuously against the authority of the whole
counsel* ye have not alonely kept no silence herein at all, but the more
vehemently have ye also preached, insomuche that ye have filled all Heirusalem
with your doctrine, and the rumoures of your doings are the mean while
publyshed abroad, yea to the cities that border about us. Well, ye go about
maliciously to bring us in hatred for the death of this man. For openly ye do
preach that we slew him, which thing cannot we deny. Ye publyshe also that
the selfsame person was good and holy and well with God approved, and in his
name ye work miracles, which is as it were to dishonor, and condemn us
before the multitude, of cruelty, that have procured such a man's death. This
was the hgyhe Bishops oracion, which contained no honest matters to defend
it self, only it made some afraid with words of high authority, that the
truth in deed, which ought to be for man's health publisshed to all men,
should be kept in silence for the wicked men's glory.

Now let us on the other part hear a fisher, the very Archebysshop of
Christ's gospel, how boldly, and soberly also makes he an answer for all
the apostles: High and bountiful Bushop, he says, and ye that are rewlers of
great authority, with other also the elders very wurshipfull men, that sit
here in counsel together, we despise not your authority, but we prefer the
authority of God to man's authority, and so promised we to do in that
answer we made you, when ye forbode us to speak any word at all of Jesus
name. And as I suppose there is not one in this assembly, that thinks it mete
that we should for man's prohibicion, take light regard to gods
commandments, and whiles we fear your wrath, run into Gods
dyspleasure. If your commandments stood with the will of god, we would
with all our hertes, satisfy^ both you and him. Now sense your prohibicions
do utterly square with his commandments, and that we cannot satisfye both
the one and ^ke the other, we had lieffer obey God, than manne. And it is not
our desire to bring any in hatred by preaching of Jesus name, but to procure
salvation to every manne. And more it were for you expedient, rather to
submit your authority to the will of God, then to bring us hither, refusyng
utterly to say ought, or else to do contrary to gods will.

The God of our fathers reised up Jesus whom ye slew. and have hanged on tree.
The way is open for each manne, to come by remyssion of his sins, if he a
mende his life, and louyngly do embrace the truth of the ghospel. Even thus
shall ye find it, as we have showed you heretofore: the God of our fathers,
whom ye and we, and we with you do wurshyppe, has raised up from death his
son Jesus, whom ye fast naylyng him on a cross, have s^ayne. And verily so
was it decreed by the divine counsel, so it was heretofore spoken by the
Prophets, that one should dye to save the world. This self same person,
even like as he was but feeble in body, manne has put to death, but almyghtie
God has called him to life again: and of his infinite power, has him exalted
to such renown and glory, as to be a guide for all men, and the chiefest
worker of man's salvation, but pryncipally for the children of Israel, and
that all may redily come through him to remission of sin, which be
content to forsake their evil living, and to profess his holy name. And to
these things that we rehearse to you, bear we record, that kept in house
with him familiar company, before he died, and after he was from death
revived, oftentimes heard him, saw him, and handled him, until he ascended up
(all us beholding him) to heaven. But if ye esteem our wytnes to be of small
importance, the holy ghost bears wytnes of the same, whom he powers upon
all that receive his gospel, as ye see it in us a ready. You hear strange
languages, you see woondrefull things wrought excedyng common reason. There is
naught here of our own doings, it is Jesus holy spirit, that puts forth
his power and virtue abroad by his ministers. This oracion of Peter's, well
besemyng for an apostle to make, which ought either for dread of punishment to
fear them, or else for the hope of salvation that was even at hand to allure
them, chafed their minds and made them the more incensed against them,
insomuch, that their hertes would have braste for anger, laying their heads
together how they might slay them. Than had the priests for their part, of a
long time customably used murder: and to cut like buchers, sheep and goats
in the temple, whereby they had gotten themselves naught else, but a slayght to
kyl men also, the more easily. In all this their communication not a word was
heard of divine scripture, nothing godly spoken for man's erudicion, no reason
at all. Only this command we, this is our will and pleasure, either obey
the same, or else shalt thou suffer death.

In that council sat one Gamaliell, a Pharisey, at whose fete Paul the
apostle learned the law, a man in high estimacion with the whole people of
Israel, both for his excellent knowleage in the law, and for his singular
wisdom. This Gamaliel, when he saw them so bent to unthrifty council, stood
up, and desired that the apostles might for a while depart out of the council.
That done this said he to them that were there sittyng: ye my brethren of
Israel, proceed not headlyng in your council, neither determine any thing
unadvisedly, which afterward may turn remediles unto your shame, but take
good head what ordinance ye make, or judgment ye give of these persons.
Take counsel of things past, what shall be expediente for you to determyne for
the time to cum. I will rehearse no ancient examples of old time. For before
those days rose up one Theudas.
That as I shall rehearse to you, was done sense al ye may well remember. There
was of late days one Theudas, an enchau^ter, and a false deceauer, who by
boastyng himself to the people, and promysing of prodigiouse things, drue to
his factiouse opinion a great number of men, nigh unto the poinct of four
hundred. But his busy enterprise, because it proceaded of a maliciouse stomach
had an vnthriftye end. For both he himself suffered pains of death, and as
many as had taken his part, were sum slain and sum taken prisoners. When all
were thus scattered abroad, the sect was brought to naught.

After him was Judas of Galile, a countreyman to these persons, that ye now
consulte upon, the same time that the whole world was taxed by commandment
of Augustus Caesar. And this same Judas, for as much as he taught things
pleasant to the people, that they bring dedycate to god, ought to pay no
tribute to Emperors, which were woorshyppers of false gods, drew to his
faccion a great part of the comens. And afterward both he ye captain of
this faccion was slain, and as many as took his part, were scattered abroad.
Wherefore this is mine advise, that more wisely shall ye do, if ye forbear
these persons, and let them go, seeing that no man hitherto is hurt by them.
For if this, that they have enterprysed, or that that they go about to bring
to pass, proceed of man's wit, it shall of it self cum to naught. But if god
be the worker of this so wonderful a matter, it were both an ungodly point
in you, to mind the destruction of that thing which God is the principal doer
of (for what were that else but to resist god) and besides that lack of
foresight, to go about that that ye cannot bring to pass. For who shall be
able to withstand the will of god?

This his council was so esteemed with the whole assemblye, that the sentence
of death, which they would have pronounced on them, was differred until an
other time. And as for this time, they agreed to Gamalyels council, not that
they would utterly hold their hands of thapostles, but that after they were al
twelve called together, and beaten, they should be charged again upon a
strayte commandment, not to speak from that day forwards, so much as one
word of the name of Jesus. And so were they contented upon this punishment
to dimitte them, thinkyng that though they had made light at their thundryng
words, and threatninges, yet would they be better advised what they did or
said, being once punyshed for a warning: esteminge thapostles which were, to
look upon, abject persons, and of the base co^minaltie, to be like in condition
to the rude and barbarouse people that are amended with strokes. But the lively
spirit in a preacher of the word of god, is wont after such injurious
afficcions, And they departed from ye counsel reioysyng that they were counted
worthy to suffer rebuke for his name.
to gather his strength together. Thapostles, because they were well assured
that the words ye Jesus spoke were true, that they should be called before
judges, and that they should be scourged in their Synagoges, and
congregacions, for no evil deed, but for professing his holsum name, departed
from the council, lufty in courage, and joyous, taking their reprocheful
beatinges, which to other were thought intolerable, to their praise and glory,
for as much that god would recognyse them his apostles worthy such honor,
that they might for his own sons sake, spitefully be entreated. They had in
remembrance what Jesus had said to them before: rejoice ye and be glad, for
great is your reward in heaven. So little this punishment and menacing auayled
the princes, to hold them abacke from preaching Jesus name, that thapostles
took thereof the more courage to preach continuallye what they had heard of
their master Jesus, both openly in the temple, and in every man's house
privily, and to bring to each man gladsum tidings, that this was very Messiah,
by whom all should be saved.

The.vi. Chapter.

AT the same time, when the disciples (for so were they than named, who
afterward were called Christians) increased daily more in number, the Greeks
that were amongst them, which were none other than Jews, although not borne
in Iewrye, by profession yet Jews, and borne among the Gentyles, begane to
murmr and grudge against the Hebrews. The cause of this their grudgeyng,
sprange of an affeccion or love toward their country folks. For whereas the
apostles carried about with them certain women, which did them service, the
Greeks were agreued that their widows were not had in such estimacion as that
they might serve thapostles, and disciples, by daily handreachinge. For such
ministry or service was esteemed with them, to be a thing of much preferment.
And this was the first ambicion in christ's church. And yet though the
discord amongst them was but little or small, It is not meet that we should
leave the word of god and serve tables.
forebecause thou should understand how sore a good shepherde ought to be
displeased therewith, the twelve apostles in continente, when they had called
together a great company of the disciples, to the intent it should be of the more
authority that was determined with all their conse^tes, said in this manner to
the^: we see grudgeing, what soever the matter means, spronge amongst us, as
touching the service we have at woman's hand. Some order therefore must be
taken, that we, who are appointed to an higher office, be not in this wise
often interrupted, with such light matters of charge. The lord has enjoined
us by an especial commandment, to teach the gospel. It is not therefore a
thing well to be allowed, that we should lay aside the office of preaching the
gospel, that we be charged with all, and serve at tables. For like as in the
body are sundry members, and every membre does his office and duty: even so
in such a great multitude, trouble and confusion cannot be avoided, except
diverse offices be distributed amongst diverse persons, after such a sort,
that all together be referred to the profit of the whole body. Wherefore
brethren, look ye out among you seven of honest report etc.
For neither sees the iye for it self alone, but for all the members. Neither
the hands labor only for them selves, but for ye whole body. Wherefore
brethren, look out of your noumbre, seven men that are of honest report,
replenished with gifts of the holy ghost, and endowed with synguler wisdom,
to whom we may commit, having your good will withal, this necessary
business, wherein we have been hitherto occupied, not without hindraunce to our
exercise in the gospel. And when we are set at more quietness by their
diligence, than shall we apply our selves to those things that be long to us
for our own parts to do, as prayer and preaching of the gospel. They shall
take charge with fedyng the bodies, we will apply our studyes to feed your
souls. The whole cumpany were well pleased with this oracion. And they chose
Steue^ a man full of faith and of the holy ghost. etc.
And so were seven than chosen, with consent of all the congregation Steven a
man in good credit, and one that largely had received ye holy ghost. Philip,
Prochorus, Nichanor, Timon, Patmenas, and Nicholas of Antioch, a proselite by
his profession. These seven, when they were chosen, were set before thapostles,
to thentent that what was done, they should allow the same by their
authority. Thapostles when they had made their prayers to god as they were
accustomed, laid their hands upon them. For according to this approved
custom, were holy ministers assigned at the beginning, upon example which was
taken of our master Jesus, who was wont to lay his hand upon those that he
blessed. But if any demand ye quetion, what need such tites to the
appoyntyng of ministers that should take charge of the table? let him
understand that handling of monye, is in very deed a temporal exercise, most
common among men, yet such that would require sum special credit in him, yt
shall be charged therwithall, and an upright conscience. Witness hereof was
Judas, whom his unclean heart, being corrupted with avarice, styred him to
betray his master. And furthermore, because that these seven persons
prescribed to other also, what was thought in such business necessary for to
be done, it was mete for them to be put in authority, that all other should
the rather obey them, as fellows with the apostles and their furtherers.
Moreover the disciples feasts were not such, as be among ye vulgar people, but
as often as they took any meat, they took it very devoutly. Every broken
morsel of bread, represented to them, the body of our lord, every draught
of wine put them in remembrance of our lords blood. Finally both the lords
body it self, and his blood was ministered to the people by the Deacons. And
if they were any time at leisure, besides their temporal ministry, than
preached they also themselves, the gospel, as those persons that were next of
all to the apostles.

By such manner means it came to pass that the doctrine of Christ's gospel,
was sparsed every day further abroad, and the disciples multiplied at
Jerusalem with right good success in all their affairs. For a great part
no^ only of the comens received the gospel, but many priests also which
had before conspired against Christ and his apostles, when they had repented
themselves of their evil living, and laid down their pride, submitted them
unto the sweet yoke of the gospel.

But Steuens holiness among all the deacons, glistened pryncipally. For so
handeled he himself in his office appointed him, that he was most in favor
with the whole multitude of the faithful, for his excel^ente sobernes in
behauioure: and toward them that were rebellyous to the gospel, he
expressed so valiaunte a courage, that he was never by them ouercum, insomuche,
that he wrought many and great miracles among the people, in the name of
Jesus, yea as one that endeavored himself to express the virtuous steps of
thapostles. But forasmuch as exceliente virtue procures it self envy, like
as does the stern wind draw to him the white clouds, certain rose up
against Steven, of diverse felowshyppes, of the which one was called
Libertines, another Cyrenites, sum of Alexandria, an other sort of such that
came out of Cilicia, and Asia. For to these countries which were ioynyng unto
Siria, above al other were the Jews dispersed: all these sorts, as though
they had be of one conspiracy, arose together against Steven dysputyng with
him, and yet could not all they, although many in number, stand in reasoning
against this one young man's wisdom, and the lively force of his courage, for
because ye holy ghost who^ he was full of, spoke in him.

Mark me here the manner and fashion of the wicked. When they had cast of al
truth, unable to make their party good in disputacion, they fell to practice
of foregeyng lies, and being once put to the wurse by wisdom of the holy
ghost, they gave themselves wholly to the practyse of diuilyshe deceytes. For
they brought in certain men with false witness, that said they heard Steven
spo^ke blasphemous words against Moses, and against god. And there was none
offense among the Jews, that more deserved death, than did blasphemy, and
more detested with the people. Consider here, good reader, like inuencions
against the servant, as were before practiced against the Master. They
brought in false accusers, because they would not be seen in their own
persons, to revenge the inward grief of their minds, which they had
conceived for the blancke they were put unto being men of themselves
insufficient to cope with Steven in disputacion. An hainouse crime ^ought they
out, by their false ymaginacion against him, and cloked their cankred malice,
with a pretensed love to religion. Than were the people with the elders also and
Scribes, by means of these false tale tellers, which had been preuelye sent
in, sore moved against Steven, insomuche as all they with one assent together
took him violently away, And the^ moved the people and the elders and the
Scribes
and haled him before the council. Here came they forth before them, that were
ye hired records, for to play out their parts and to say: this man have
never done breaking out into blasphemouse words, against this place, both
holy and with all us honorable, and against Moses law that was delivered us
of god. For we heard him say, that Jesus of Nazareth would destroy this
place, and change the ordinances that Moses gave us. But this was Steuens
report upon relacion of ye apostles, For we heard him say, this Jesus of
Nazareth shall destroy this place.
how Jesus had prophesied to them, that the temple and city likewise should
be of their enemies overthrown, even from the foundation, for the peoples
infidelity. This rehersall of Steven, craftily they wrested to a false and
s^launderouse accusacion. A man might well affirm these to be the same
persons ye accused Jesus, reportyng thus of his words: we heard him
saiynge: I will destroy this temple, and set up an other in three days. But
Steven at this sharp and cruel accusacion, was nothing moved in his mind for
he was clear in his conscience, insomuch that he, from the botome of his
heart, appeared in his very countenance, to be innocent. For the mind that
knows euel by it self, is never out of fear. This his stedfastnes in
countenance put his accusers soon to rebuke, for their shameless falsehood. For
those that sat there in counsel, beholdynge him, and markyng well how
boldelye he took the offense that was laid to his charge, same him so little
discouraged at the matter or dismayde, that his face seemed to utter by
countenance, sum thing above man's excellency, and a certain chearfulnes
withal, and majesty, besemyng for an Angel to have.

The.vii. Chapter.

THan demanded the high priest of the accused person, to the intent he might
frame his sentence in judgment toward him, after form of law, as he did
before in condemning Christ, this question: whether he had ought to answer to
those things, and whether he would acknowledge ye offense that was brought
against him? Than Steven being inspyred with the holy ghost, began in this
wise to make answer to the playnte profoundly, with a rehersall made even from
the beginning. Honorable audience, all that here be present, either brethren,
by trade of our country religion, either else by reason of auncientnes and
authority fathers, give ear to me in my defense of innocence, as ye have
done to mine accusers patiently. I have neither used to speak contumeliously
against god, neither against Moses, nor against the temple, but my endeavor
has been not disagreynge here from Moses, to advance gods glory, and that
spiritual temple am I a buyldyng, like as god commanded me, wherein god that
is the very spirit, is best pleased. It is no blasphemy for a man to set forth
that thing to the uttermost of his power, which Moses shadowed in figures,
which the prophets, being inspired with gods holy spirit, has before spoken
of, which the son of god ye was sent down to earth, for the same purpose,
has both begone, and put his own in credit withal to finyshe, which the
holy ghost now perfourmeth for all peoples salvation, through them that believe
the gospel. But to strive so obstinately against the will of god, being so well
known, and so bounteous toward al men, is naught else, then to hate god, is
none other thing, than to blaspheme god. Which obstinate manner, this nation
has not of late days begone, but what they have begone long ago to do,
now they never cease to continewe, so that now we ought to take it for no
marvel, or think our selves otherwise than indifferently dealed withal, if
that cum to pass, that Jesus of Nazareth prophesied to cum, that is to say,
that this temple, that you so much brag and boast of, and this city where
ye reign, that priesthood, that law, which ye abuse to your dishonest
advantage, and vain glory, be taken away from you, and this your renown
and glory be translate to them, that can be content to wurship god syncerely,
in true faith of the gospel, and to keep the law spiritually, and to frame
themselves a lively temple, and an holy, for the holy ghost. And although god
provoked our elders by many sundry ways to this point, yet this rebellyous
and obstinate people, always despised him. And to begin among al other, of the
chief ancient father, and patriarche of this nation, whose obedience I would
to god they followed, that bost themselves to be his children: God the father to
whom all glory is due, and whom we and you worship devoutly, Get the (...)
of the country* and (...) thy (...).
appeared long time paste unto Abraham, our principal father, while he was in
Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran, and said unto him: get the out of thy
country and from thy kindred, and cum unto a land, which I will show the. He
obeyng gods commandments, went out of the Caldeies land, and began his
dwelling in Charran, as purposing to take his Journey farther, into sum other
place to dwell, when he saw his time. God eftsoon brought him thence over into
this land, where ye dwell now, and that after his father Thares death, for
whose age he had differred to change his dwelling place. But over brought he
him in gest wise, and as a stranger, giving him none inheritance here, And
promised that ^^ would ge^^ it to him to possess.
in so much as he possessed, no not ye breadth of a foot, e^^epte it were
purchased: but god promised to set his posterytie in possession of this land
after his death, when that Abraham in those days had no son. And though it
seemed to be a thing vnbeleuable that was promised, yet both Abraham believed,
and god performed: and his promise herein is found true, like as he in all
other things which he has heretofore spoken, always was found true of his
word.

And thus said he than unto him. Thy seed shall be in a strange land, and the
people whom thy posterity shall live withal, like strangers, shall make them
their bond men, and cruelly handle them for the space of four hundred years
and thyrty: at the last, shall I deliver them, says the lord, of their
bondage: and the people, whom they shall serve, will I judge, and be avenged of.
After that shall they serve me in this place, out of man's subieccion: and
that god might the more by sum mean, And he gave him ye covenant of
circumcision.
bind his people to stick unto him, gave he unto Abraham circumcision, as a
seal of his promise. And so Abraham trusting to gods promise, begat Isaac,
and having in remembrance his couenaunte made with God, circumcised his child
the eight day after his birth. Isaac on the other part circumcised Jacob, and
Jacob his twelve sons the Patriarchs, and chief fathers of our auncestry.
Amongeste these twelve, sum there were that little remembered gods promise, but
being moved of envy, devised such a like thing against their brother Joseph,
as their posterity has devised against Jesus of Nazareth. They cast him into
a cestern, and furthwith sold him to merchant men, that brought him into
Egypt. But like as almyghtie god raised up Jesus being slain, and extolled
him on high after that he was cast down: so delivered he Joseph at that time,
out of all his troubles, and brought him by means of his good conditions,
and foreiudgement in things to cum, in favor with Pharao king of Egypt,
insomuch that Pharao put him in authority over Egypt, and over all his house.

But there came a dearth over all the land of Egipte, and Chanaan, and great
trouble withal, so that our fathers could find no sustinaunce for them. Jacob,
when he had knowledge that there was plenty of corn in Egypt, sent out our
fathers thither to fetch corn thence. And the second time that he had sent
them thither, was Joseph known of his brethren. The rumor hereof, came also to
Pharaos ear, that he was an Hebrewe borne, and had a father and eleven
brethren on live. Joseph than sent for Jacob his father, and all his whole
kindred into Egypt, because they should not lack. All they were in noumbre
three score and fyftene. And so came Jacob down into Egypt to dwell, and dyed,
both he, and his twelve sons, our fathers, and were laid in a sepulcher,
which Abraham bought for an hundredth silver cicles, of the children of Hemor,
son to Sichem. None of them all had hitherto ought in possession of the land
that was promised Abraham's posterity.

But the time than drawing nyghe, when god would have that performed which he
had promised Abraham, the Hebrews increased, and were multyplyed in Egypt,
until Pharao dyed, and an other king succeeded him, with whom Joseph was not so
much in favor, as he before had been with Pharao. This same king, fearyng
lest the Hebrews should to much increase, kept under our kynred craftily,
and dealte evil with our fathers, commaundyng the mydwiues by proclamacion,
that they should cast out men children, that none should remain on live. At
the same time was Moses borne, against whom, these men falslye reported of
me, that I should have spoken blasphemous words. This Moises was in favor
before god: who suffered not him to perish, for by his providence, privily was
he nourished for three months space in his fathers house. Yet for fear of ye
kings commandment, he was cast out in a twiggen basket or hamper, playstred
over with lyme, into the river of Nilus. As it chau^sed, Pharaos daughter took
him up, and being much delited with the propernes of the child, nouryshed him
up at home, for her own son. Than was Moses taken for an Egypcian, and
instructed from his childhood, in all manner cunning and wisdom of Thegypcians,
and was mighty in words and deeds.

And when he was full forty year old, it came into his heart, to visit his
brethren the children of Israel. And when he saw one of them suffer wrong, he
defended him and avenged his quarrel, that had the harm done to him, and smote
y^ Egyptian. And he supposed his brethren would have understand, how that God
by his hand, should deliver them. But they understood not. But when he was
fully cum to forty years of age, he thought it good to visit his brethren,
the children of Israel: For he expressed always, tender love toward his own
nation, of whom he had his beginning. And when he had seen, as he was
conuersaunt amongst them, one of the Israelites suffer wrong of an Egyptian,
he avenged the Hebrews quarrel, and slew the Egyptian. Declarynge even than,
the towardenes of a good captain. And he supposed that the Hebrews had
known already at that time, how God had determined to save the people by
him, and to deliver them from the bondage of Pharao. And this Moses presented
in himself, a figure of Jesus of Nazareth, whom god verily has chosen to
redeem the people from bondage of sin. But like as the Israelites perceived
not this in Jesus, even so nor than did they understand that in Moses.

The day after, as he was in way again to visit his brethren, he found two
Israelites stryuing together, and partyng them a sundre, he would have set them
at one again, saying: what do ye syrs? sithen that ye are brethren, and of one
nation, why hurt ye one an other: but he that did his neighbor wrong, thrust
him a back that would have set them at one, saying: what medleste y^ in our
matter? Who made the a ruler and judge over us?
who made the a judge and ruler over us? wylt thou slaie me al so as thou
slewest the Egypcian yesterday? And where as all that Moses did was by
inspiracion of the holy ghost, yet found he shortly there amongst his own
brethren, sum that rebelled against him. When Moses heard of this, perceiving
how his face was not unknown abroad, and fearyng for his own part, ye
Egiptians, fled into the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.

And forty years after, an angel of the Lord appeared unto Moses in
wyldernes, upon Mount Synay, in a Bushe, which seemed to be all on fire. Moses
being as one dismayde at this sight, assayed to go nere thereunto, to see what
thing it was. But the Lord, whose voice sounded in the bushe, forbade him: I
am (he said) the god of your fathers, the god of Abraham, the god of Isaac, the
god of Jacob. Moses when he heard this name, trembled thereat for fear, and
durst look no near. Than said the lord: put of thy shoes from thy feet,
for the place where you stand, is an holy ground. Moses obeyed the lord.
Than forth he went in his talk. I have well marked how my people in Egipte
has been troubled, and have heard their groaning. And therefore of compassion
toward them am I cum down to deliver them. And now cumme, and for this cause
will I send the into Egypt. Behold and see how plainly is Jesus of
Nazareth signified here by Moses. The people of Israel rejected Moses before
they knew what he was, saying: Who made the a ruler, and judge over us? Like
words spoke our brethren unto Jesus: in what authority dooest thou these
things, and who gave the this authority? For all this while knew not they
that god, for ye pity he had to our people, than had sent them this captain
and purchaser of liberty, and gyuer of life everlasting.

And Moses whom his brethren despised, god advanced to honor, and made him
a captain, a governor, and a deliverer of his people. And for his aid and
assistence, he had with him thangell present, which appeared to him out of
the burning bushe. By whose help brought he his people out of Egipte,
workynge many woonders and meruailes in the land of Egypt, soon after in the
read sea, and besides that in wilderness, by the space of forty years. As
Moses was to one nation or people alone, so truly is Jesus of Nazareth unto all that will follow his guyding. Now lest any should think them to be Moses
adversaries, which publishe and set openly forth Jesus of Nazareth, y^ same
Moses himself, has commended to you Jesus of Nazareth, promysyng many lives
ago, that he should cum, whom ye see now is cum to you. This said he: a
Prophet shall God raise up for you, one of your brethren like me, him ye shall
give ear unto.

This I say is the same Moses, that like as before he talked alone with
thangell nygh unto the bushe, so comoned he with him afterward in wyldrenes,
upon mount Syna, in presence of a great number of people, and semblably talked
with our ancestors, This man received the word of life to give unto us: etc.
to whom disclosed he that, that he had heard of the lord. He had received
of him a law, for that end he should make to us redelyuerye of the same,
which law should give to the kepers thereof, life everlasting. And for all
that Moses was of so great authorytye, yet would not our fathers obey him,
but repelled him, and as men that had clean forgotten out of what miserable
and wretched bondage they were delivered, desired to be again in Egypt, to
the intent they might, when they had once cast of their captain, the authoure
of their weal, and their redemer, and despised the law of life, repair unto
the naughtye manners of such that wurshipped false gods. And therefore while
Moses was in co^municacion with thangell, said they unto Aaron: make for us
sum gods which may goo before us. For Moses, y^ brought us out of Egypt,
know not we what has become of him. And they made a calfe in those days, and
offered sacrifices.
And forthwith according to the example of the Egyptians, which wurship their
god Apis in the image of an ox, made they for themselves a calfe, wrought out
of pure gold, and offered up sacrifice unto this god without life, and
despised the living god, by whose tender goodness, they had escaped bondage: and
rejoicing in so wicked a deed, as though it had been well done, daunsed, and
kept their feasts and bankettes, refusyng the true god, that made al
things, and bragginge of their dumme gods, whom they had made for
themselves, with their own hands.

God being displeased at these things, turned himself in like manner away
from them, and suffered them to take their own pleasure, in somuche that they
worshypped at the last, not one god only, but according unto the Heathen
example, the whole company of celestial bodies. The Sun, Moon, Sterres,
Mars, Mercury, Uenus, and Saturn, whom the ungodly Poets take for gods, And
ye took unto you ye tabernacle of Moloch.
where as they be but bodies fourmed of god, to serve for the use and profit of
man. This that I say, can not be denied. This was the very thing that god had
indignacion at, speaking by the mouth of Amos his prophet: have ye the house
of Israel offered unto me sacrifices.xl. years in wilderness? at the least way
ye have embraced in stead of gods true temple, Moloches tabernacle, which
is an ydoll among the Amonytes, and Rempham, a celestial figure of your god,
which is Lucyfer, or Uenus, that the Sarasins do worship. These dumme images
have ye made for yourselues to worship, and despised the living and true god,
who alone has made all things. But forasmuch as ye delyted in them, I will
bring you over into Babylon, that ye may serve eftsoon idolaters. Now is it,
as I suppose, suffycyently declared that I have naught said, or spoken
blasphemously, to the derogacion of god, whom I sincerely worship, neither
against Moses, whose Prophecy I hertely do embrace, but that they rather
have blasphemed who has by following the wicked steps of our elders,
despised for a long time passed, both god him self speaking by his prophet
Moses, and yet at this present time, despise both god and Moses speaking in
Jesus person of Nazareth. And as touching the law, I have in no wise be found
blasphemouse, for whom the law has appointed us to receive, whom the
prophets euerychone has promised, him have I lovingly received: but rather
they are to be accounted blasphemouse against the law, that follow still the
steps of their wicked fathers, who set naught by Moses law, and now refuse
the law of the gospel, a law that Jesus published for all men, which law
does not abrogate Moses law, but perform it.

Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed
them, speaking unto Moises, that he should make it, according to the fashion
that he had seen. Which tabernacle also our fathers that came after brought in
with Iosue, into ye possessions of the Gentiles, whom God drove our before the
face of our fathers, unto ye time of David, which found favor before God
and would feign have found a tabernacle for the God of Jacob: But Solomon
buylt him an house. Now for the temple, which I am reported to blaspheme,
harken what I have to say in few words. I am well assured this temple was
builded by gods commandment, to the intent it might be a figure of a
temple more holy, and give place to a better, even like as the tabernacle of
witness wherein was an arc of testimony or witness, which our fathers carried
about with the^ in wilderness, gave place to this your temple. For god speaking
by the mouth of his Prophet Moses, had appointed him the fasshion of that
tabernacle, according to the which examplar, it should be builded. That same
tabernacle, our old fathers made much of, and Iosue than being their
captain, brought it into the land of the heathen people, whom god drove
away before the face of our fathers, until king David's days. Who being than,
as he was in very deed, an holy man, and for that in favor with god, desired
of him that he might make him a tabernacle seemly for the god of Jacob. But
Solomon, for as much as he all his days lived peasibly, was he yt first
builded for him this magnificall temple whereof ye auau^te and boaste, saying:
The temple of the lord, the temple of the lord, the temple of the lord. But
this your temple is naught else than a figure of the true spiritual temple,
that is the congregation of the faithful, which is a buildynge by your king
Jesus of Nazareth, whom Solomon figured.

For sense that god is a thing all together spiritual, he dwells not in
houses made by man's hand, neither can he be enclosed within walls, who is
of such greatness, that cannot be mesured, and contains all things. This is
even it, that he himself bears witness of, speaking by Esaias his prophet,
heaven is my seat, and earth is my foot stole. What house will ye build for
me, says the lord, or what place is for my repose? Has not my hand made
them all? Tha^ had god, who made all things, rest in himself, before he made
al. And if he take rest any where, he rests not in houses made by man, seeing
that heaven is a seat for him, and the earth his foot stool: but his delight
is to rest in quiet hertes, and such as be always ready at commandment of
the holy ghost. Wherefore then, whose conscience is polluted with vicioule
living, he defiles gods temple. And who that puts them to busynes, which
be already at commandment of his holy spirit, he polluteth the temple of
the Lord. And like as he offends not Moses that prefers Jesus, neither
breaks he Moses law, that places it behind the gospel, even so doethe
not he violate this temple, that prefers thereto a spiritual temple, wherein
god is more delyted. For it is but reason that shadows give the verity place,
which puts now herself forth to light. It is meet, that that thing which
of it self is carnal, give place to that, that is spiritual. This
vndowbtedlye ^ the very immutable will of God, and for this cause sent he down
his own ^^nne alone upon earth, he sent also the holy ghost, to the intent the
light of truth in his gospel might cum abroad to all manner people.

But ye persisting obstinately in defense of that, which of it self is
carnal, now rebelle, as ye were wont, against gods holy spirit, who
called you now long ago, stubburne people. And yet think ye your selves to be
Israelites, and the children of Abraham, because ye have a piece of that skin
which covers your pryute membre, circumcised, whereas your hearts, as well
as ears, are left uncircumcised. But they shall be from hencefurth, the true
children of Abraham, that be in heart cleansed of all wicked desires, that keep
their ears obedient to gods commandments, and so pourged of grosnes, as
touching carnal understanding, that they may perceive the spiritual meaning
of the law. For like as your fathers by reason of their gross understanding
and dull hearing, resisted always the holy ghost: even so did ye also, not
unlike in conditions to those your ancestors, never leave of your evil
speaking, and doing against the holy ghost, as it of late appeared in Jesus
of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, and now in his Apostles. How often has
your fathers rebelled against Moses? Why may not I call them your fathers,
whom ye follow in conditions? which of all the Prophets has not your
fathers persecuted? And those that prophesied to you of the just to cum, by
whom alone all should be justified, have ye not only punished, but murdered
also. Ye hated them that told you of his cumming, and when he was cum, and
performed all that they before had told you, Which of ^ Prophets have not
your fathers persecuted?
ye not only refused to embrace him, but upon a false impechement, ye put him
into Pilates hands, and brought him by mean of his sentence, unto a more
shameful and mischeuouse death, then if ye your selves had had the
perfourmaunce of the act, all in your own hands. And all this do ye upon a
pretexte to defend the law, whereas neither your elders observed the law,
which was delivered them by angels, neither you that of late days put him to
death, whom the law has promised and appointed, and now besides do persecute
him, whom ye have slain, envying your selves the gift of eternal salvation,
which is prefored you: and procuring your own utter destruction, which ye
without cause lay to our charge and to Jesus of Nazareth.

This oracion or tale so truly told them, and so frankely spoken, sore chafed
al their minds, that were in council together, insomuch that their hearts
were even ready to break in soundre, and gnasshed their teeth against him.
But Steven as one undoubtedly replenished with the holy ghost, was nothing at
all in mind troubled by them, but in a redines to suffer death, cast up his
iyes, according to Jesus Christ's example, to heauenward, from whence all
help and succoure for a christen man, is to be looked for and desired. Than was
forthwith this valiant champion strengthed against the conflict, which was a
cummyng. Heaven opened, and the glory he saw of god, and Jesus whom he
professed, standing on the right hand of his father. And this vision kept he
not close and secret from the multitude, although they were wickedly bente.
For it were not expedient for man's malice to suppress gods glory. Behold,
he says, I see heavens open and ye son of man standing on the right hand of
gods majesty. It were a profitable thing, here to consider the manner and
form of this his judgment. Faults were laid in against him. He made answer
to the^ al. And being but a young man, he alleged for himself, both
testimonies of the law, and of the Prophets. They were vanquished in their
accion by piththy reasons. There was nothing here spoken by him of god, but
godly, nothing of Moses, but honorably, of the law nothing, but according to
the meaning thereof, of the temple, nothing contumelyously. And yet their
hearts for anger, were a breakyng in sundre, and they grinded their teethe
together, like wood men and frantyke. So loath were they to see their own
glory dimynished, and his glory published and praised, whose glory alone,
god would have openly declared to all men.

And the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name
was Saul:
If he had praised Moses or Abraham, they would have forborne him: but now
that Jesus should be alive, that he should stand on the right hand of god,
like as David prophesied, that could not they abide. But as they had be al
stryken than, or turned into a fury or madness, they stopped their ears
against so wholesome doctrine and communicacion, and ran al at once upon Steven
violently with outrageous cries. And as though he had been tha^ convict, and
condemned for blasphemy, they cast him out of the city, expressyng in this
one point alone, Moses law: and there they stoned him. And the witnesses, as
though they had gotten the vpperhande of him, whose duty was after Moses
law to cast the first stone, to thintente they might the redier be to that
cruel murder, laid down their garments at a young man's feet called Saul,
who than of ignorance, and love toward his country law, favored ye wicked
part. Soon upon this they began to stone Steven, who neither contended
again, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge
neither spoke words to the^ of any reproach, but made to him, whom he had
seen, his inuocacion, and said: Lord Jesus take to the my soul. Thereby may
thou know him to be Jesus disciple. For in like manner said he upon the cross:
father I commend my spirit into thy hands. After this, while the stones flygh
on every side, and he was kneling upon the ground he cried out aloude with an
high voice, and an inward great affeccion of mind, and said: lord, lay
not this unto their charge, for they know not what they do, how plainly does
the servant express his master. This was the last word before his death,
after the which he departed this life, as it were with a sound sleep in the
lord, in whom whosoever dies, does not dye in very deed, but falls into a
sleep, and shall again, after he has taken his pleasant test, awake to life
everlasting. It besemeth as many as be true christians, to dye in such a
mind. And so Steven right well agreyng to his name, deserved first of all,
the crown of martyrdom, and offered up to the Lord, the first fruytes of
sacrifice, that were seamely for the gospel.

The.viii. Chapter.

SOme there were among that multitude, which were not than persuaded that
Jesus was the son of God: and so by mean of such ignorance, their offense
was the less, though it excused them not of murder, forasmuch as they,
being so blinded of their own inordinate desires, had leauer avenge, then
learn the truth. Yet of all other, none were less to be holden excused, than
the bishops, scribes and phariseis. Sum again there were which of very
ignorance, not of any malice, believed that it was a pleasant sacrifice to god,
to dispatche the world of them, which went about to subvert the law that
god had left to man. Albeit charity of the gospel excuses, yea those
things, which cannot be with man excused. Amongst those that of plain
ignorance did amysse, and of no maliciouse mind, Saul was accounted one: who
was borne in the Isle Tarsus, a young man, favoring Moses law excedyngly,
which afterward became of a rauenynge woulfe, a meke lamb, of a cruel
persecutor of Christ's gospel, and egre defender of the lybertye thereof. But
stones verily cast he none that time at Steven, And at that time there was a
great persecucion against the congregation which was at Jerusalem.
but was assentyng to them, that had condemned and stoned him, and for this
purpose kept he their garments, that he might be accounted one amongst the
rest of them that stoned him. And yet were not the malyciouse Jews quieted in
their minds, with the murder of this one person but a wonderful great
persecution begu^ne sone after to rise against ye church of Christ, which than
was at Jerusalem, in somuche as all they were scatered into sundry coasts of
Judea, and Samaria, saving the twelve apostles which were more constante in
mind, and steadfast, than other were: neither could the maliciouse Jews ought
do against them, no more could they against the other, but upon Jesus the
lords sufferaunce. The lord had permytted them in time of persecucion, to
fly from city to city. And this their fliyng proceeded not so much of any
fear the disciples were in, as it came of the will and ordinance of god, that
of their teachinges, as it were of seeds cast in many places abroad, a
plentiful harvest might the sooner cum forth, in Christ's religion. The twelve
apostles and no moo, like faithful shepherdes, shranke not away for all the
great storm, but abode still by it at Jerusalem. But sum well dysposed
persons, because they perceived Steven unworthily oppressed by subornate
witness, caused the dead body to be buried. Of such a godly love or affeccio^
was Joseph moved, and Nycodemus, to provide dyligently for the lord Jesus
funeralles: but Steuens death was celebrate after the Iewishe facion or manner,
with weapynge and wailynge of good men. For Christen people takes the death of
such that dye for Christ's glory, to their great Joy and comfort, As for
Saul he made havoc of the congregacyon. etc.
and as it were for the victory of gods enemies: and if there be any tears
shed, it is not for his sake that is dead, but either for such manquellers
that purchases them selves hell, either else for Christ's flock being
destitute of a necessary shepherd. In these days Saul, which had before
declared at the stoning of Steue^ sum trial of his zeal, began of a great
displeasure yt he had conceived against the Christians, like an hungry woulfe,
that teareth in pieces, and scatters abroad a flock of sheep, eue^ so to wast
gods congregation, pursuynge them that fled, searching them out that lay
hid, walking about to every house, and where he thought any to be of Christ's
profession, furiously there russhed he in haling men and likewise women into
prison, more cruel (the truth to say) then were the priests and Scribes, of
the which none at al put women to any trouble or business. This did that young
man of a good zeal, but of a noughty judgment. And therefore kept the lord
his cruelle and rageyng mind within such limits, that it was not polluted with
any murder. Whiles this persecucion was a doing at Jerusalem, such as were
disparsed, though that fear drove them far of, from one place to another, yet
ceased not to blase abroad Jesus of Nazareth: and in their walking al about
Judea, sowed here and there, as they went, the seade of ye gospel, for y^
which self same purpose, ye lord had suffered the^ so to be scattered.

Among whom was also Philip, one of the seven deacons, in order next unto
Steven. This Philip being far driven from Jerusalem, went down into a city of
Samaria, which self same city is called Sebast. And thither likewise had cum
before, a certain fame of Jesus name of Nazareth, of whom Philip preached
diverse other things that were not there spoken of before, as how he was
crucyfied, and had risen the third day after, to life again: and furthermore
when he had been couersau^t the space of four^y days with his disciples,
ascended into heaven, and how he had from thence sent down to his disciples
the holy ghost, and that all that would from thenceforth believe in his name,
should have provided for them even at hand, their salvation. The vulgar people
among the Samarites (for of al other those did most always profit by hearing
the gospel) gave good head all with one accord, to Philippes words. For that
tale, that promised all men salvation, was well worthy to be favored, and more
then that, the miracles which were not afew in number, wrought by Philip,
affirmed his words to be true. For deuilles out of many, which were possessed
of unclean spirits, even at his inuocacion of Jesus name, went forth with a
loud cry, declaryng that they went not forth willyngly, but that they were
enforced by virtue of that healthful name. Yea and that was more to marvel
at, many that were taken with the palsye, and diverse other that were lame,
recovered health. For these causes the whole city in each degree and state,
was wonderfully glad. The farther that they went from Jerusalem, and the
nearer as their access was unto the heathen, the more increase came of the
gospel that they had sown. Behold how much profited the Jews cruelty,
Philip of a deaco^, became an apostle, and for a few Hierosolomytes, which
refused their teachinges, whole cities gladly received the doctrine of the
gospel. But the church feleth greatter damage at their hands, which being
in themselves corrupted, takes part with the church, then she does by them,
that openly persecuteth her. And of this, example is here declared us, that we
should take the better head thereby, of such wolfes, that are wrapped in sheep
skynnes.

A man there was among the Samarites, called Simon, a deceyuer of the people,
and a practiser of delusions and inchaunteme^tes, who, before that Philip came
thither, practiced in that city, magikes art, and by his counterfeyt
miracles, and monstreouse things against nature, had he made the Samarites
fond on him and folyshe, who were besides of their own selves,
supersticiouse, and much inclined to deuilysh enchaunteme^tes. By means of
such falsehode and deceyte, auaunted he him self before the simple and plain
people* which were lightly persuaded to supersticion, bostynge that he was an
excellent Prophet, unto whom all the Samarites from the highest to the lowest,
gave good head. But nothing had he done in Jesus name, and therefore they, as
people astonyed at such monstruouse sightes, But as soon as they gave credit
to Philippes. etc.
which he either feigned by craft of iuglyng, either else brought to pass by
help of deuylles, said: this fellow is gods own right hand which is
called mighty. Many a day had he been with them, and long had he made them with
his sorcery to dote upon him, and therefore when he had once gotten himself a
name with the^ of great estimacion, many one believed him in all that he taught.
But after he perceived Philip able to work miracles in deed, and that more
spedely then he could do, and also more surely at thinuocacion of Jesus
name, and the Samarites quite fallen from him to Philippes belief, who brought
the^ a gladsom mess^ge of ye kingdom of god, and of Jesus Christ's name, not
bragging of himself, as Simon did, but setting forth Christ's glory with
miracles right famously, and promysyng eternal salvation to all, that after
baptism once received, would profess that name, and saw many one as well
men as women receive baptism: at the last Simon also himself received
Christ's faith, and when he was baptized, They were baptized both men and
women. etc.
begone to be of Philippes part, more for ambicio^ and desire of worldly praise
and vain glory, then for any love he bare to Jesus. For as he was perfytlye
seen in all arts magical, so saw he nothing done by Philip, thorough such
manner falsehede and deceyte, wherefore when he beheld sum miracles set forth
by him, which were of no small weight and valor, (as be al welnyghe that
enchaunters work, as to make a dragon flyghe, or a straw crepe,) but devils
to be cast out of a man with a word, and men that were taken with a palsy to
be delivered thereof at a word, he maruayled much thereat, as a man greatly
astonished by what feate subtilitie, or by what power might such things be
brought to pass.

But when thapostles which than were at Jerusalem, had heard tidinges how the
Samarites, a sort of carnal people, and the same not clean voy^ of idolatry,
had lovingly received at Philippes preaching the word of god, they were right
glad, and sent to them Peter and John, the chief of all thapostles, to ratifye
that, and set it well finished, which Philip had begone. These two being sent
to ratifye that was begone, when they had learned at their cu^ming thither, how
Philip had christened many one, gave thanks to God. Philip, and those that
were with him, made peticion to the apostles in their behalf which were
christened, that they might receive the holy ghost, and that such that were
cleansed than by baptism of all their sins might receive the gift of god
also more largely, like as they had done, which being altogether in a high
parlour, first before all other, received ye holy ghost. For as yet was not the
holy ghost cum upon any of them, saving that they were only christened in Jesus
the lords name. This authority to baptize, had the deacons given them, but to
lay hand upon the baptized, whereby was given the holy ghost, was reserved
unto thapostles alone, and their successors. Thapostles than, as soon as they
were desired, laid their hands upon them, and they forthwith in a visible
token, received the holy ghost which endowed their spirits with lively
strength like unto the fire, and enriched their tounges with an heavenly
eloquence.

When Simon the very same that was be^um of a wicked enchaunter, no better a
christen man then he was an enchaunter* perceived that thapostles by laying
their hands upon them that were baptized, gave an heavenly gift, because he
would want nothing that might a^aunce himself, and his own commodities,
proffered them money, saying: give me this power also and authority, that
whomsoever I lay my hands upon, may receive ye holy ghost. This deuilish
inchaunter thought that money might with all sorts of men, bring every thing
to pass, being not to learn that who looks for gaynes, must be at sum
expenses: his mind was to bye and sell for gaynes.

And here eftsoon was an other spring of no little myschefe in the church.
Ananias and Saphira were punished for their dissimulacion. And so was this an
example to be repelled forthwith very sharply, which, if it had been received,
should have utterly subverted all synceritie of Christ's religion. Peter
therefore declaryng to all other, what bysshoppes ought to do against Symons
disciples and folowers, made answer in this manner: It were better that this
thy money that thou go about to corrupt other with, were at the devil,
and thou together with all, which art now becum of thine own sekyng for, ye
most wretched vnthryfte of all other living, for as much as thou think that
the gift of god (which like as he of his bountiful goodness gives to us freely,
The heart ^ is not right in the sight of god.
so would he that we should freely depart with the same to other) may be
bought for money. Thou canste be here no partener of any benefyte, nor have any
thing to do with us in this our office of preaching, or giving the holy ghost,
which we of a plain and a sincere mind to godward, have taken in hand. For
though thy body be dipped in water, yet art thou for all that, unclean herein
before god. But if thou continue still in this thy noughtye and deceitful
mind, Repent therefore of this thy wickedness. etc.
nothing shall thy baptism avail the. Wherefore than be sorye for this thy
noughty purpose, and ask god forgeuenes, if thou may in any wise cum by
forgeuenes of so outrageous a crime, which though it was not already in act
performed, yet so had thou purposed it in mind, that the leaving of it
undone, was not long of the, and an ill example, of all other most dangerous
brought in thereby among the faithful of Christ's congregation. God puts
such in commission to dispe^ce the gifts of his most gentle spirit, which
be of a pure and sincere heart. I see plainly that thou art of no clean
conscience, but infected with poisonful couetice and ambicion, and tied by
means thereof, with the bonds of sin. For the releasement whereof, pray thou
must unto god with weaping tears, that the great vengeance of his wrath,
which thou have through so heinous an act provoked, may not light upon the.

Than Simon being more afraid of gods punishment, then he was for his evil
doing penitent, Pray ye to the lord for me, yt none of these things. etc.
said to Peter: do ye rather pray to the lord for me, that none such
mischief as ye have rehearsed, betyde me. Here thou see, Theophilus, two
Simons compared together: in the one is declared, what we ought to fly fro: in
the other, what is for us to follow. After that Peter than and John had well
approved by their authority, and made up all perfyte Philippes preaching at
Samaria, and had taught many things which they themselves had learned of
their master Jesus, they came back again unto Jerusalem, and by the way,
preached the gospel to many vilages and small towns of the Samarites,
always in hand with that, that their master commanded them to do.

Philip who was much desirous that the gospel might cum forward, met with
an other pray. For good men be seldom without occasion to do good. For an
angel of the lord privily warned him, and said: arise and take thy Journey
sowthward, and keep the high way that leads from Jerusalem unto Gaza, I
mean old Gaza, where no man now dwells, nigh unto the sea. Philip was
ready at thangelles commandment, and set forth on his way, as a man might
perceive in him a cheerful courage, mete for a bishop to have, as often as
need shall require to allure any to the gospel. But like as the setter forth
of enterludes appoints time for his players to come and go, even so does
here the angel moderate the setting out of these two persons and their meting.
For at ye same time, as god would have it, a certain gelded man, being a
Chamberlayne, took his journey: a person half maimed, in that he lacked his
stones, by reason whereof he was not a perfect man of body, but right wise for
all that, and of a man^y stomach: an Ethiopian borne, black skynned, And
behold a man of Ethiopia.
but one that should sone after be clothed with a garment of a la^bes flece,
immaculate, as white as snow, and change his natural complexion in the font
of baptism, a head officer to Candace queen of Ethiope, whom she had made her
high treasurer. Here speak we of a sort of people delicatly brought up by
reason of their excess and superfluity, which are well worthy to be in
subjection to a woman. Riches is the norisher of all superfluity. This man of
a devout mind, had taken his journey toward Jerusalem. For the temple there
was of so great renown, that diverse nations, yea out of far countries, came,
and brought with them sundry gifts. In consideracion whereof, the priests had
much dysdaine and hatred at them, that said this temple should be once
distroyed. This chamberlayne meaned well and godly, but foul was he deceived
to seek in the Jews temple for religion, whence it was even than all ready to
depart unto the heathen. And as he was in his repair homewarde, sitting in his
chariot, he misspent not the time in fables, or else in sleep, but for the love
that he had to religion, was in readyng Esaye the prophet, declaring to us
where we ought to seek for Christ. For in temples is not he hydden, but in
books of holy scripture.

When Philip had here in his way, met with him, the angel warned him again
privily, and said: go to, and approach thou near unto this charet. When
Philip had made good speed thither, he heard the Chamberlain readyng Esaias the
prophet, and straight thereupon perceyuyng his good zele, and endeavor unto
religion, said to him: understand thou what thou read? Than answered he:
how should I understand, a man as I am given wholly unto temporal business,
except I had one to expound to me the secret sense and meaning of the
prophet? And with that desired Philip, ye he would step into the chariote, and
sit by him, that they might the more commodiously talk together. Up went
Philip and sat by the Chamberlayne. Mark me how well does Philip here resemble
a true preacher of the gospel, and how plainly in this chamberlayne, is
such Heathen people described, as covet to know Christ. There must needs be
wonderful great increase of all godlynes, where the one hastes in much
desire to teach, the other heartily bids him to his compaynie, desirous to
learn. Here was nothing done by chance, god did set al in rule and order. For
this cha^berlaine happened for his part, unawares, upon that place of the
prophet, which described Jesus Christ.

This was the place of Esaias: he was led as a sheep to be slain, and as a lamb
held he his peace before the person that clyppe^ him, and not once opened his
lyppes. Because of his humblenes he was not esteemed. Who shall declare his
generation? For his life is taken away from the earth. This text of Esaye,
when Philip had repeated to him, the chamberlayne was more enflamed with arde^t
affeccion to know whom the prophet spoke of, and said: of who^ I pray the,
speaks the prophet these words, of himself, or of sum other? See how apt
this chamberlain was to learn. He had heard that Esaye himself was cut in
pieces at commandment of king Manasses, with a wodden saw, and ignorant was
he not, that prophecies lay sumtymes after such sort of doubtefull, that
what seamed to be spoken of this person or that, after the historical sense,
oftentimes might after a more priuey or mystical sense, pertayne to another.
But easy is it to teach that person, which in such wise demands.

Than Philip, as one that was ready with right good will to teach, opened his
lyppes, and beginning at this place of the prophet, expounded to him briefly
the principal points of the gospel, that is to say, that this person, whom
the prophet spoke of, was the son of god* through whom god had decreed,
and by his prophets promised, freely to save all that would put their trust
in him, and that he would for this cause have him to be borne again very man
of the virgin Mary. And where the one nativity and eke the other can not be in
word expressed, whether it be his eternal generacio^ of his father, which
from ever was without circumscripcion of time, or that he once had of the
virgin, by the holy ghostes handyworke without man's help, taking so upon him
man's nature, that he departed never from his godhed, the prophet Esaias seeing
this in spirit, and much astoyned thereat, said: who shall be able to declare
at length his generation? Furthermore that he was the true paschall lamb,
for whose deaths sake, his father had appointed to deliver, not only the
Israelytes, but al other nations also, from bondage of sin, and from death
everlasting.

And therefore delivered he him into the hands of the priests, scribes,
phariseis, and head men among the people, who brought him afterward unto
Pilate, being than judge and liutenaunt of the province, to thentent he might
be crucified. And for as much as his will was to dye for our sakes, no
answer made he before him for his releasement, but as he had been a sheep,
suffered pacie^tly al their mockes, and al their punishementes. But there hid he
the puissaunce of his divine power, and submitted himself for man's sake, to
the lowest degree of humility. The Jews supposyng verily that he was none
other thing at all than he seemed to be, condemned him, and put him to death.
This is it undoubtedly that the prophet speaks of: In his humblenes is his
judgment exalted. An innocent is to death condemned, which shall cum once
again on high, and surmountyng all other, and shall judge the quick and the
dead. But god the father has called his son back to life again the third
day. After what time of his resurreccion, was he the space of fowertie days
conuersaunt on earth, both seen often, and felt of his disciples corporally,
and than finally in sight of them all, lift up he was into heaven. And the
tenth day after his ascencion, sent he down from heaven the holy ghost, who
in such wise enspired the apostles hertes and their toungues also, that they
might without all fear, publyshe unto all people through out the world, Jesus
of Nazareth, for the chief author and foun^ayne of life, and health
everlasting, not by any help of Moses law, but by faith and baptism. Of all
these points rehearsed, none there is, that Moses law has not in figures
sygnified, And as they went on their way.
that the prophets have not before spoken of, yea that Jesus himself has not
taught and promised. The chamberlayne, whiles that Philip was declaryng to him
these points of the gospel, with other many mo, was ware by chance, of a
little spring of water, fast by the way, and said unto Philip, why prolong we
so great and weyghtye a matter? See where water is at hand. Thou have now
informed me, and I am all ready. What shall let, but that I may forthwith be
christened? Than answered Philip: there is no let at all, if thou steadfastly
believe, and keep with all thy heart, those things which I have taught the. This
promise alone is made at baptism. Than answered the chamberlain right
gladly: I believe that Jesus is the very same Christ, who^ the prophets has
promised, and I believe that he is the son of god, for whose sake, al men have
proffered the^, health everlasting. Philip caused the chariot furthwith to stand
still. It was a noble carriage, richely garnished, and semely for him that was
an head officer to a barbarous queen. But down allow must he come, that shall
be found mete for baptysme, and strip himself naked of all garments. Both
went down into the water, and there Philip christened the chamberlayne, a
poor man, the rich, a simple and an abject, the puyssau^t and mighty, a man
in himself right perfect of all his lymmes, the imperfect that lacked part of
his me^bres, a Jew, the Ethiopian. So little regard here was had to man's
personage. There is no disagreaunce where is faith in Jesus Christ, and
consent of mind together in one accord. And as soon as they w^^ cum out of
the water.
After baptism, there was neither cha^berlayne, nor Ethiopian, but a new
creature. And as for Philip, as soon as he was come out of the water, an
aungel of the lord took him away, and more of him saw not this chamberlain,
neither after desired he to have his teaching, being once inspired with the
holy ghost in baptism: but as one right glad at the heart, that he had learned
Christ's faith, made an end of his journey, that he might at home likewise
publishe the name of Christ among his country men of Ethiop. Finally the
angel set Philip down in the next city called Azotus, whence he came: and
taking thence his journey, in every place, where village or town did lie in
his way, he preached the gospel, until, he came unto Cesarea, a city in
Palestine, where his dwelling was.

The.ix. Chapter.

While these things were in doing, Saul in all his procedynges against the
Christians, expressed much cruelty, not only within the walls of
Jerusalem, but where else he perceived that the disciples, which were
scattered abroad, had spread also the word of the gospel purposyng than more
and more with himself not only, to threaten them and to enpryson, but to kill
and murder them in sundry wise, went unto the high Bishop, to thentent that by
maintenance of his authoritee, he might the sooner consume them: and desired
to have his letters of commission, not only to cities nygh there about where
he had already exercised his cruelty, but unto Damasco, a city in Phenicea,
far of from Jerusalem, dyrected unto the Synagoges of ye Jews there dwelling,
for that end that he might, through their aid, at commandment of the high
Bishop, bring fast bound to Jerusalem, whomesoeuer he had taken faulty in
this heresye, ^yther men or women. These and such like things was Saul
moved to do, of a plain and no dessemblyng mind, supposyng with himself,
according unto the Lords saying, that his devour and service herein, was
pleasant to God. And therefore God suffered not his hands to be polluted with
innocents blood, but called him abacke in the mids of his rage. For when he
was almost at his iourneyes end, not far from the city Damasco, a sudden
light from heaven, shone about him: and sodainlye, as he was fallen for fear
upon the ground, heard he a voice, saying unto him: Saul, Saul why do
thou persecute me? Tha^ Saul as one stricken with a great maruayle who he should
be, that on high above, and so mighty, complained of wrong as it were done by
his friend, and in doubt whether he were some angel, or else God himself,
answered fearfully: who art thou, O Lord? Than said he: I am the same Jesus
of Nazareth, whom thou supposeste to be dead, whereas I do live and reign
in heaven. But thou in persecucio^ of my disciples, and of my name, do
persecute me also, unawares thereof. But all thy labor is in vain.

For it shall be hard and paynfull for the, to beat thy heels against the
prycke. For thy striuyng is not against manne, but against god, whose will no man is hable to resist. Wherefore thine offense herein, is double the more,
and nothing shall thou prevail thereby, and yet do thy self a shrewde turn.
Saul hearing this, trembled for fear, and as one amassed, said: Lord, what
will thou have me do? By this answer, his error appeared to have cumme of
plain ignorance, and of no malice. To instruct once such erpsons, it were
sufficient. But it was expedient that an high and fierce stomach, were plucked
down, and such one that minded naught else but to threaten and kylle, were
made afraid, to thentent he might be easlye taught. Than said the lord to
him: arise and go into the city. There shall thou learn what is for the to
do. The lord stryketh man in such a sort, that it may be for his health: so
he casts down, that he may set up, so makes he them blind, that he may
lighten them. Saul being in his cruellrage, was thrown down headlyng, but
after that he became meke and ready to obey, he was bid stand up.

While these things were thus in doing, the men that went with Saul, in his
journey, stood amassed, hearing certainly one talk to Saul, but seeing no man.
Than Saul upon good comfort that he took hereof, arose up. The first step to
virtue is to be set up on foot. And behold again an other miracle, although
his iyes were open, he could not see. Than those that came in his company, lead
him by the hand into the city of Damasco. And yet was not he than forthwith
admitted to the gift of the holy ghost, that it should be noted of us that
came after for an example, how it were not mete to lay hand forthwith upon
each person, but first to see them that are newlye instructed, diligently
tried, and prepared by fasting, and prayer. Wherefore than, like as the
apostles abode at Jerusalem ten days space, in expectacion of the holy
ghost, so tarried Saul at Damasco three days, seeing none yearthlye thing with
his corporal iyes, but thinwarde iyes of his soul, were in ye mean space
clearly illustrate: all that while receyuyng no food, but his mind was fed the
mean time with heavenly doctrine. And there was a certain discyple.
There was the same time at Damasco, a disciple, (for so were they than called
which had received the gospel,) named Ananias. The lord had piked out this
Ananias, by whose hands his pleasure was bounteously to replenishe Paul with
gifts of his holy spirit. And therefore him spoke he unto being a sleep, in his
dream, and said: Ananias? He on the other part anon perceiving that god called
him, made answer: lo I am here lord: as who says disclosyng a true christian
heart, ready at all commandments. Than said the lord: rise up and go thy
way into the streat, which they commonly call straight, and ask at Judas
house for one Saul, who was borne in Tarsus. For lo, there is he in prayer,
suyng to have grace and liberal comfort from us. At the very same time, Saul
likewise as he was in prayer, thought ye one Ananias, had entered into ye house
to him, and laid his hands upon him, to the intent he might receive again his
iyesight. Even so the lord prepared in their mutual vision each one for
other.

But Ananias sore afraid at the name of Saul, who for his cruelty, was than
much spoken of among the christians, made answer: I have heard lord, of many
one, how sore this man has vexed thy blessed saints at Jerusalem, and yet
not so contented, but now is he hither come also, being put in authority by
a straight commission from the high bishops, to lay the^ al fast in fetters,
that call upon thy name. Herunto the lord again made answer: I know right
well how ye my sheep are much afraid of that ravenous wolf.

But there is no cause why thou should fear. For that wolf have I changed
into a right gentle sheep. Wherefore see thou go unto him boldly. For him I
have chosen to mine own self, as a notable instrument, to carye my name
before the Heathen, before kings of the earth, and the children of Israel.
What he has done hitherto, was not done of malice, but of a zele to the law
of his country. And forasmuch as of plain ignorance, his judgment failed
him, sum trial has he showed of his towardness, how earnest a defendour of
my gospel, I am like to have of him, in time to cum. Hitherto has he scryuen
against the professors of my name, being armed thereunto with bulls from the
high bishops, with threatenings, and with fetters for them. Hereafter more
manfully shall he fight and stoutly, being armed but with my spirit, and gyrte
with the sword of my evangelical word, against all them that hate my name.
For the glory and renoume whereof, far greater affliccion shall he willyngly
suffer, than now of late he prepared against you.

Ananias, well encouraged at these words, departed thence, and entered into
Judas house: he found Saul praying, and laid his hand upon him, and said:
brother Saul, the lord Jesus Christ, that appeared unto the in the way* as
thou waste cumming hither, has sent me to the, to the intent thou shouldeste
receive thy sight again, and be replenished with the holy ghost. Ananias had
uneath spoken these words, but there fell from the iyes of Paul in the same
place, as it were certain scales of a fish, and so recovered he his sight.
And immediately he stood up, and was baptized. After that, when he had received
sum food, he was well strengthened. In this manner that excellent captain of
Christ's gospel, and he that should soon after obscure the glory and renown
of other his apostles, received at the hand of Ananias, a poor and humble
disciple the holy ghost, before that he received baptism. But nothing is done
out of order, that is done at Jesus Christ's commandment, who^ Paul had
for his teacher. For so had he given his apostles authority, that he would
nevertheless reserve unto himself, the higheste authority of all the whole
matter.

Than Saul being suddenly changed, abode for certain days in company with
the disciples, which were at Damasco. And without any further delay, he
begone furthwith even there, contrary to the bishops commandment, to set
upon the office that he was appointed unto by Christ. And he went into the
Jews Synagoges, and published openly and frankly, affirming that Jesus of
Nazareth was the son of god, for whose sake alone, all men should have
proffered them, according to the Prophets foresayinges, health everlasting. The
Jews, which knew of Saules cruel fierceness against the Christians, by the
rumoure that was bruted abroad, reioysyng that they had gotten such a valiant
defendour of Moses law, when they had heard that he did so earnestlye preach
Jesus name of Nazareth, they maruayled what had chanced unto the manne, that
he was so sodainlye quyte altered, and said amongst themselves: is not this
the same Saul, who of late did all that ever he could, assault them that
called upon this name at Jerusalem, which name he blaseth now abroad, and
famously publishes: and now but of late came hither, purposely to take all
such persons, (if he might find any here) and to bring them fast bound to
the high Bysshoppes, there to be punished at their will and commandment?
How cummeth this to pass, that he has so suddenly cast of his Iewyshe
conditions, and forsaken Moses, and has become a professoure of the
crucified? But Paul, whom that name in very deed than better agreed with,
after that he once became of a troublesome person, a teacher of soberness and
quiet libertee, so little was afraid at such manier sayings of the Iewyshe,
that he being every day the better strengthened with spiritual coumforte,
confounded and much troubled the Jews that were dwelling at Damasco,
affirmyng constauntly, and proving by the testimonies of holy scripture, that
Jesus of Nazareth, whom he had before of ignorance persecuted, and did now
preach, was the true Messiah that was promised to the world, and that none
other should be borne hereafter, at whose hands the Jews ought to look for
everlasting health.

When Paul had taken such an enterprise upon him, many days at Damasco, no
little to the disciples joy and comfort, and not without a great rumble and
murmour of those, that did not than believe, the Jews at length laid their
heads in council together, to the intent that they might (by lying in wait for
him) slaye him. O what a nation is this that murthereth men? Paul reasoned,
taught, and vanquished the Jews with testimonies of their own law, as it
were with their own weapons. But there was nothing else with them, but
conspiracies, stocks, prisons, stripes, and sundry kinds of death. But this
had the lord by promise, assured his well-beloved servants of, that they
should not lose, no not a hear of one of their heads, except his father
suffered it. The time was not than come for that excellent warryoure to dye in
the gospelles cause, he had than many battles behind, to fight for Christ's
people, many daungerouse perils were to come, for him to sustain in fight of
battle, many cities and countries were left for him to subdue by gods holy
word, and to call unto Christ's yoke. Wherefore Paul, They watched the gates
day and night to kill him.
as it was gods will, had warnyng that ye Jews lay in wait for him,
insomuche that they kept the gates day and night in watch for him, that he
should not away escape, but that they would kill him. To bring this act to
pass, they had procured them aid of the Lieftenaunt of the city, who was the
debytie of king Aretas, to the intent that if their priuey watch had not well
proceeded to their purpose, they would nevertheless openly and by force slay him.
The disciples than, conceyuing in their minds, how that the less the person
cared for himself, the more was he worthy to be saved, would not suffer, so
valiant a warryer in Christ's word, peryshe. Wherefore they hid him, and by
night let him down by a cord of the town walls, in a basket. Even so
oftentimes, yea, bold and valiant capitaines do run away, to the intent that
they may, according to the proverb, be able to fight again.

O what a woondre is it to see ye course of things turned vpside down? Now
lurketh he in corners and starteth away, who a little before with many sore
thretnynges persecuted: and now provide they to save Paul's life, whom he
before invented crafty means to slay. After this, wha^ he was once come to
Jerusalem, and would have acco^panyed with the disciples, with whom the old
Saul was to well known, Paul as tha^ unknown, al were afraied of him, as
the sheep of the woulfe: not trustyng his words that he was a disciple,
calling well to their remembrance what cruelty he was wont to express, in
persecutyng Christ's flock. They suspected than that some privy wyles had
been cloked under the name of a disciple. But Barnabas the Leuyte, of whom we
spoke before, that knew what was done concerning Paul, brought him to
thapostles, before whom, he declared all the whole matter, how the lord had
appeared unto him as he was going to Damasco, and spoke to him, and how suddenly
his mind was changed, and how fra^ckly and freely he had preached the gospel
in Jesus name the lord. Thapostles reioysed thereat, and with their honest
rehersall, commended him to the whole company. So was he for a time, busylye
occupied at Jerusalem, keeping company with thapostles, and disciples, and
boldly there professyng, and preaching the name of the lord, which he had of
plain ignorance, persecuted.

And that did not he only before the people of Jerusalem, nothing afraid of
the reprochefull name of an Apostata, because he had swarued from the bishops
trade in religion, but preached likewise Jesus name before the Gentyles, which
for the great renown of that city, dwelled than at Jerusalem, and before the
Jews, which were borne among the Grecians, reasonynge with them, and by very
testimonies of the law prouyng that Jesus was the savior of the world. But
in no wise could they abide such liberty of speech, and therefore resorted
to such, as they were wont to do for aid against him, whom they were not
able in disputacions to vanquyshe, searchinge out some way to slaye Paul.
Such be their disputacions, that are of Iewyshe conditions. And even than
were privy wyles also invented to betrappe him withal, when that he least
thought upon any such daungier, After that the brethren knew of this, lest
any thing should betyde him otherwise then well, they conveyed him a way
unto Cesarea Philippi, which is a city in Phenicea, and sent him eftsoon
thence unto Tarsus, in Cilicia where he was borne. For by means of Paul's
wanderyng about, and his leadyng from place to place, the gospel well
prospered. In the mean while, after the time of persecution was well
ouerblowen, the congregation of disciples, which than were disparsed
thoroughout all the parts of Iurye, Galile, and Samarye, in the which
countries principally taught the lord, and where before all other places, he
commanded that his gospel should be preached, lived at some reasonable
quietness, taking comfort each one of other, through mutual unity and
concord: and what for the small regard they had to man's threatninges, and
the daily increase besides of their number, they were well edifyed in Christ's
faith, living in fear of the lord, and replenished in time of adversity
with spiritual consolacion of the holy ghost. This was it undoubtedly that the
lord had promised them: in the world ye shall be well assured of trouble and
adversity, but in me shall ye have quietness of mind, and ghostelye comfort.

It befell that Peter, whiles he as a vigilant shepehearde, of a stout
courage, went abroad, trauelyng many countries, now these to visyte, now
those, came also unto the holy saints that dwelte at Lydda. That Lydda is a
city on the sea side in Palestine. There found he one called Eneas, who had
layne bedred eight years before. For he was taken with a palsy. Peter tha^
remembryng the lords commandment, that what house soever they came into they
should heal the sick, for it were not syttyng for bodily diseases to reign,
where spiritual phisycions be present, said to him: Eneas, Jesus Christ make
the whole. Arise, and make thy bed. Immediatlye upon these words spoken, he
rose up whole, and made his bed himself. This was a token of perfyte health.
When they saw him suddenly made whole by virtue and power of Jesus name, who
had layne bedred so many years, as many as dwelt at Lidda, and Sarona, a town
on the sea coaste nyghe unto Lidda, were converted to the Lord, and professed
the name of Jesus Christ. And so of one which was restored to his corporal
health, were many a one moved to health of soul.

There was again at Ioppa, a disciple called Tabitha, which with the Greeks
signifies Dorcas, with ye Latynes Caprea, which name give they of the clear
sight of the iye. This woman had been virtuously occupied in all manner
godliness, but chiefly in works of mercy, wherewith she releaued the poor. It
befell the same time that Peter was busye in his office at Lidda, that she dyed
of the same disease that she had been sick of. And when they had done with
washyng the dead corpse, according to their accustomed manner, they laid it in
a high chamber for to be anointed. And for as much as Ioppa was not far from
Lidda, and the disciples had understanding that Peter was there, they sent two
men in message to him, desiring that he would vouchsafe to come unto them.

Peter than declaryng in himself an example of a good shepehearde, came to
them vndelayedly. After his cumming within the house, they brought him up into
the chamber, to the intent he should be moved at the sight of the dead corpse,
to take sum pity or compassion for her death. There stood about Peter all the
wydowes, who among other ministeries, which were praise worthy, chiefly were
commended for serving the holy in all their necessities: they mourned her with
weeping tears, which they let fall, more of pity toward the poor whom she
was wunt to refreshe with many good turns, then for her ^ake that was
departed. Their weapyng was then a sufficient openyng to him of their minds
what they desired to have.

They called not to rehearsal her good deeds, but brought forth to sight, the
coats and other garments, which Dorcas had already made to clothe the holy
withal. But this her endeavor in doing good, was by death interrupted. Then
Peter having in remembrance Jesus example, where as he raised up the chief
priests daughter of the Synagoge, after the multitude of those that mourned
were first of all put out of doors, commanded them all to go forth. For the
widows were only they that mourned. And weping is a let to prayer. And
moreover because that women, which of their own nature are weak spirited,
should not be troubled at the rysyng up of the dead body he would have none
of them to be present* but he all alone, prayed, knelyng on his knees. For the
holy ghost, by whom all miracles are wroughte, is not at all times in like
force with man. But his virtue by prayer, is quickened, like as faith is also:
And turned him to the body and said: Tabitha, arise.
without the which no miracle at al is wrought. When Peter had made his
prayers, and conceived spiritual strength of the holy ghost, he turned him
to the bodywarde, and said: Tabitha, rise up. Than she, as these words were
spoken, awaked, as though she had been in a sleep, and looked upon Peter. And
after that she had beheld him well, sat her down again. Peter than putting
forth his hand to aid her withal, set her up, being tha^ on live and lastly.
After this manner must they be lift up unto godliness, which be of their own
selves weak: First of all must god be prayed unto, that he would take mercy
upon them. That done they must be taught what to do, rebuked for their life
misspent, and exhorted to amend. Finally they must have aid as Dorcas had, to
be lift up by good example, to more perfeccion of life.

When Peter had called the holy brethren and widows, whom he before had
bidden go forth, into the chamber again, which were likewise their selves
occupied in prayer, lokyng for the mercifulnes of the Lord, he showed them the
woman on live for them all to behold. That miracle was soon bruyted abroad
over all the city of Ioppa, and caused many one to believe in Christ. For
that is the very chief commodity that cummeth of miracles. For it should not
otherwise much avail to call one or two amongst so many thousands, that
come by times into this world and depart the same, unto life again, which
must nevertheless soon after dye. And this was an occasion for Peter to tarry
many days at Ioppa. For where should he that fissheth for men's souls
abide more to his contentacion, than there as many cummeth unto his net? All
this mean while abode Peter the chief of all the apostles, and he that by
reason of so great miracles which he had wrought, both was famous and
mighty, at one Simons house, a tanner by his occupacion.

The.x. Chapter.

Hitherto had none of ye apostles been conuersaunt among the heathen, but by
occasion was that chamberlain which came from Ethiop, induced to Christ's
religion. And yet sum of the gentiles were the better, that they dwelt nere
unto ye apostles. For in Cesarea, ye most floryshing city of Palestine, which
to fore was called Strato^s castle, was a certain manne named Cornelius,
captain over a band of me^, which were of Italy. This man, though by trade of
his auncestry, he were heathen, and by reason of his office, a man of arms,
yet as one that desired to be a christen man, he was a good liver and feared
god. Like him was all his whole household. For it is commenly seen that the
residue of the household, do frame themselves in conditions, like unto the
master of the house. He in two poyintes chiefly, declared himself meet to
take upon him Christ's religion, in liberally refreshing the neady, and poor,
and in continual prayer to the lord. He knowledged the true god, for that he
learned, A deuou^e man and one that feared God.
by reason that he was conuersaunt among the Jews. He knew that his favor was
chiefly obtained, by being beneficial to the poor, and by continual prayer.
It remained always certain, that he which had already abundauntly enough,
should have more given him. This man being in his prayer, not much before
supper time, the nynth hour of the day, did evidently see a vision, the angel
of god cummyng toward him, and calling him by name, Cornelius, as though he
had been familiarly acquaynted with him. But Cornelius beholding than the angel,
and being sore afraid by reason of the majesty of so rare a personage, said:
Lord what art thou? The angel answered: thy prayers are not spente in vain,
neither yet thy alms deeds, wherewith hitherto thou have earnestly called upon
god, to be merciful to the. For what thou have bestowed to refreshe ye poor,
ye lord vouchesafeth to count it bestowed upon himself: and he will reward
thee in their behalf, which are not able to require. Wherefore thou have not
employed thy benefit on him that will forget it. Thou haste done for thy part
according to his will, he again on the other part, will accomplish that thy
request, which thou haste continually by prayer, desired. The lord has
heard thy prayers, because thine ears were not stopped from the poor. Now
therefore this must thou do without delay, that from hence forward the lord
may show unto the, his bountiful goodness. Send sum of thy servants to the
city Ioppa, and enquire there for a certain man named Simon, and desire him
to cum speak with thee, this man in the iyes of the world, is not of any great
estimacio^, but in the sight of god, high in favor by reason of his godlynes,
and is otherwise called Peter. He hosteth at a certain man's house in Ioppa,
whose name is Simon, a tanner by his occupacio^, and dewelleth by the sea side.
Of this Peter shall thou learn what thou must do to obtain salvation. When
the angel had this said, he vanished away. Than by and by Cornelius sent a
couple of his household servants, and with them one that was a soldier
retaynyng to him, whose honest conversation and trustynes, he had great
proof of, for not only all Cornelius own household resembled him in godly
living, but there were sum soldiers also, that followed the virtuous trade of
their captain. And when he had showed them all the matter and effect, as
touching his vision, he sent them to Ioppa. These things were done in the
evening.

The next day Cornelius messengers went on their iournaye. In those days, so
mean an embacie as that was, had Peter the chief pastoure of Christ's Church
no disdain at. And when as they were almost at Ioppa, Peter the same time, as
he was accustomed, had gone up into an high chamber to pray, almost at the
syxte hour, that is to say, about noone. And as he was an hungered in his
prayer, he minded to eat sum meat after his long abstinence. And whiles
that meat was a dressyng according to Peter's commandment, he was rauyshed
with the spirit of god. So chances it specially with them, that use prayer
and fasting. For god discloseth not his mysteryes to the fulle belyes, and
slothful persons. His vision was this. He saw heaven open, and from thence a
great vesse^l let down to the earth, as it had been a great sheet, knotted
and fastened with coardes at every of ye four corners. For in old time meat
was served to the table in great broad lynen clothes. In this vessel were all
kinds of four foted beasts, and virmin which crepe on the ground and live on
the earth, and birds that live in the air, as well unclean as clean,
together indifferently. This was meat that the Jews did abhorte, but yet was
it the same that Jesus longed after, when he said to his disciples, profering
him meat: I have meat to eat yt ye know not.

Peter much maruayling what this vision meant, a voice spoke and said unto
him: arise Peter, kill and eat. And although that the lord had warned his
dysciples that they should make the Gentiles also partakers of his gospel,
yet to the intent they should the more boldly do the same, he again was
admonished by a vision. But Peter, as a Jew, yet abhorting the meat that by
the law was forbid, said: Oh lord, god forbid that I should eat any such
meats. For unto this day have I dewly kept the trade of my forefathers. For
hitherto never eat I any meat that was suspe^ded, or unclean. To this,
the same voice that had spoken before, made answer: that which God has made
clean, thou which art but man, call not it unclean. After this vision had
thryse appeared, to this end, that he should more certainly believe it, straight
ways the vessel was taken up into heaven.

Than Peter being cumme again to his remembrance, whiles he was musing with
himself in a great perplexity, what this vision should mean, and whether
it were a dream, either else some significacion of gods will, behold those
men that Cornelius had sent, stood at Symons door the tanner, and calling
forth one of the servants, enquired whether that one named Peter were hosted
there.

But before that word was brought to Peter, that some there were that would
speak with him, and whiles he satte imaginyng in his mind, what the vision
should mean, the spirit of god said to him (for god speaks after sundry
wise to his elect) behold three men stand at the door and inquire for
the. Therefore arise and get the down, and go with them, nothing doubtyng:
For I sent them. And then shalt thou understand what the meaning of this
vision is, that thou somuche musest of. With that Peter went down; and came
to the men, and said, loo I am the very same Simon Peter whom you seek
for. What is thoccasyon of your cummyng hither? Peter boasted not of his
visyon, Behold I am he who^e ye seek what is the cause wherefore ye are cumme.
but required the heathens confession. For the benefyte of grace that cummeth
by the gospel, ought not to be thruste before them which set naught by it,
as in like manner it ought not to be denied to the^ that are desyrouse of it.
Than they answered: Cornelius which by office is a captain of a band of
men, but yet a man of good conversation, and that fears God, well
credited and likewise esteemed, and reported as well of his own household, as
also throughout all Iewry, was warned by the apperaunce of an holy angel that
spoke to him, to send for thee home to his house, that he might receive at thy
hands knowleage what he ought to do to obtain salvation. Than called he the^
(...) and lodged the^
Peter perceiving the visions to agree, and now understanding what that voice
sygnified, which thryse had said, what God has cleansed, that account thou
not unclean, bad them comme nere the house. For it was euentyde, and he lodged
them. This was the first beginning of any conversation between the Jews and
the Gentyles, which Gentyles by their own accord, preased to be partakers of
the gospel. But the Apostles did wisely in that they were not to hastye in
the setting forth of this matter, that it might be euydent to all men, that
they did not rashely, but by the commandment of God, receive the Gentyles to
the benefyte of the gospel. Cornelius sent for Peter, but by the
commandment of the Angel. Peter came down and met them, but not before
he had commandment by the visyon. On the one part, mark the earnest desire
that the Gentiles had to the graciouse benefyte of the ghospel, on the other
part the cherefulnesse of him, and readynes, that was desirouse to save al
sorts of men.

The next day Peter went to Cesarea, being accompanied with certain christen
men from the city Ioppa, that should bear wytnes of those things that were
for to be done. For their mind gave them, that sum good luck was toward,
they wist not what. In the mean time, Cornelius being very desirous of
salvation, waited for the return of his messengers, that should bring with
them Peter, and had called togethere as well his nygh kynsfolkes as his other
chief friends, partly that more might be witnesses of this fact, and partly
also that more might be partakers of so great a benefyte. But when as Peter
entered into the house of this captain Cornelius, he much reioysyng thereat for
reverence toward him, went forth to mete him, and falling down to Peter's
feet worshypped him: perceyuyng to be in him sum what more excellency then
was semely for a man to have.

Thus ought Christ to be worshipped in his ministers, but yet so, that the
glory dew unto God, be not attrybuted to manne. Then Peter giving example how
much the preachers of Christ's word, ought to abhor ambicio^, and the
desire of honor, and how small praise ought they to challenge for those
things which be done through virtue of Christ's name, suffered not this
captain to lie prostrate upon the ground, but embracyng him in his arms, did
lift him up, saying: arise, I am but a man as thou art. Give unto God this
homage, for I am but his minister.

And commonyng than in this wise familiarly with him, entered into the house
together. When they were cum into the inner house, Peter found there, a great
number assembled together. It is an unlawful thing for a man y^ is a Jew, to
company or cum unto an alien.
Here conceived he as a covetous pastor good hope that he should have great
vauntage. And so when Peter was set down, he began, as an heavenly orator, to
speak to them in this wise, partly that those that came with him, should not
have occasyon to be offended, and partly that he might stablyshe the captains
household in that their confydence, which they had conceived: you know that it
is not permytted by the laws, that a Jew be either in household, either
otherwise in company with aliens, men of a sundry kind of religion, and not
cyrcumcised. Yet I being a Jew, am not afraid so to do, not yet despising
either the trade or custom of my country, but following herein the
commandment of God, that signified unto me by vision, that I ought not to
esteem any manne, what country soever he be of, to be unclean, or hate
worthy, for as much as god takes no man to be unclean. For only he makes
holy every thing. I therefore stickyng to the commandment of god, For what
intent have ye sent for me?
came hither without delay as soon as you sent for me, wherefore it is your
part to show me what the matter is, that you send for me. Peter speaks to
all, that he may win them all, perceyuyng that for this cause they were
assembled together, that they might al at one time, hear the gospel
preached. Mark how featly Peter plays the pastors part: for he does not
communicate the high mysteries of the gospel unto them, before he perceived
them to be desirious to learn.

Than Cornelius before them all, rehearsed how the matter stood, saying: four
days paste I was here in my house fasting, and earnestly in my prayers, about
the ninth hour of the day. And suddenly behold a certain man, whose
countenance was full of majesty, stood visible before me, in a glystening
garment, and said unto me: Cornelius thy prayer is heard, and thy liberal
and bountiful alms, that thou have bestowed on the poor, is not forgotten in
the sight of God. Wherefore send to Ioppa, and desire Simon, otherwise called
Peter, to come to thee. He is hosted in the house of Simon the Tanner, nere to
the sea. Than sent I incontinent messaungers of mine own folks unto thee,
which thing I had not been so hold to have enterprysed, unless an angel
had so wylled me. And I most hertely thank you of your goodness, that
vouchesafed to come hither. Now therefore we are here present all of one
mind, without hurt meaning toward any man, as we take God to witness, very
desirous to hear what God has given you in commandment to show us. For
thaungell that put me in this confidence, promised me so: and we doubt not but
you will so do, forasmuch as you also by the commanudemente of God,
^ouchesaued to come and common with us.

Than Peter perceiving their unfeigned meaning, opened his mouth, and began to
speak in this wise: I do right well perceive that in the sight of God, one
person is not preferred before another: but that in all countries who that
fears God, and lives like a good man uprightly to God and the world, is set
by of him.

For as much as I understand that you are free from our law, and yet
nevertheless that ye woorship one God which is the true God, as we do: and that
daily ye offer through prayer, sacrifice, and seek his favor by succouring
of the nedye: For why? this is thonely thing that the law and prophets do
teach. And although that God has now at the last performed that thing
which he long sense promised, by the mouths of his prophets, that he would
send Messiah, that is to say, Christ showing to ye Israelites his will, now
not by mean of any prophet, but by his only begotten son Jesus Christ and
proferyng them, through faith and obedyence to him whom he sent* remission of
sin, and that he eftsoon will be reconciled with them: Yet that
notwithstanding because there is none other God but he, as well of the Gentiles
as also of the Israelites; his will is that this favor be showed to all men,
whosoever believes the gospel. And I am assured, that the rumor of this thing
being sparsed, as it is, thorowout all Iewrye, is heard among you also, How
god anoyncted Jesus of Nazareth with the holy ghost.
how that Jesus walked over all parts of Iewry, exhortyng all men to
repentance, bearyng wytnes that the kingdom of God is even at hand. And
chiefly his beginning to preach, was about Galilee after he had been
christened of John, which was his foremessanger, and openly bare witness of
him, ye Jesus of Nazareth was the lamb of God, that should take away the
sins of the world, and that god had anointed his Messiah with the holy
ghost* whom he had seen in likeness of a dove as cummyng from heaven and
restyng on his head, and that it was only he that should Christen all the
faithful, not in water, as he himself Christened, but with an heavenly power.
And this our lord Jesus also expressed in deades, walkyng thorowout all
parts of Iewry, helpyng all men, not only in teaching the heavenly
Philosophye of the gospel, whereby the soul is healed, but also in curyng the
sick, castyng out of deuyls, healyng lepers, and reysyng the dead, and to be
short, in helpyng all men whom the devil by tyranny kept under his yoke. For
as he only was free from all sin, so he only was hable and of power, to
vanquishe the tyranny of the devil, the which raygneth over them, that
leads their life in sin. For God expressed his might in his son, which
all Satan's power was not hable to withstand. All these things being commonly
spoken of thorowout Iewry, I am assured that you likewise have heard, and do
believe them.

But that you may more surely believe this, we that were conuersaunte with him,
both in house, and in all other places, as long as he, being manne, lived among
men, do bear wytnes of all such things, as he did in all coasts of Iewry,
and in Jerusalem also, whom the high priests, scribes, and Pharisees, with
the consentes both of the nobility, and the commens, put to death, fastenyng
him on the cross, rendryng him evil thanks for his so manyfolde benefits
employed on them. ^ym God raised up y^ third day, and showed him (...) etc.
But God, by whose permission all these things were done for the health of
man, restored him to life the third day after his death, and endowed him with
life everlasting. To make this certainly to be believed, he did personally
appear alive, he was heard, seen, and felt also with the hands, not of all
the people, as he had been before his death, but of certain that were before
chosen witnesses by God purposely, of us I say, unto whom he appeared after he
had arisen from death, being conuersau^t on earth fowertie days: and we did
eat and drink with him, and he with us likewise, lest we should doubt in our
minds, whether his body were in very deed raised or not. And before he went
into heaven, he commanded us, whom he before had chosen to this office, that
we should openly preach to every man, and bear witness, that he was one, whom
god had advanced to high estate and power, that in thend^ of the world, he
shall be judge of all, both quick and dead. In the mean space a sure and an
easy remedy is proffered every man. For all the prophets long since with one
consent prophesied the very same of him, To him g^^e all the prophet^s to
^^ues. etc.
that we teach, that it is only he, in whose name remyssyon of sin shall be
given, not to the Jews only, but to all nations also through out the world,
not by merit of their works, wherein the Jews put confidence, but by faith
whereby we believe the gospel, and by mean of the gospel, believe in Christ.

ghost. For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnified god. Then
answered Peter: can any man forbid water, yt these should not be baptized,
which have received ye holy ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be
baptized in the name of the lord. Than prayed they him, to tarry a few days.
Peter had not yet made an end of his tale, and behold the holy ghost visibly
descendyng from heaven, came on all that had heard, and believed the apostles
words. Which thing made the Jews, that were converted to the gospel, and
had come in Peter's company from Ioppa, to bear wytnes to those things that
were for to be done, astonished thereat, merueiling that the gracious gift of
the holy ghost, was also powered forth upon the Gentiles, which were not
circumcised. For they supposed the promise of the Prophets to pertayne to the
Israelites only, For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnified god.
whereas in very deed, the prophets said before, that the spirit of God
should be shed on all those, whatsoever they were, that would call on the
name of God.

And the chance that followed, expressed the meaning of this token which they
had seen. For they began, in presence of all men that heard the^, to speak
diverse languages, praysyng much the bountiful goodness of God. This so evident
a token, was declared for the Israelites, that were already present and
circumcised, that from thenceforth they should not stycke to call them,
which were not circumcised, to be partakers of the faith of Christ: it was
likewise done for Cornelius friends, to put them out of doubt that by their
faith, they were nothing inferior to the Jews, yea though they kept no^ the
Jews laws. Here according to ye pleasure of god, the order was changed, for
first they which were newly instructed in the faith, had wont to b^
christened, and afterward by laying hands on them, received the holy ghost.
But here without laying of their hands on them, first the holy ghost was
given, that the apostle should nothing stycke to ministre that, which was of
less estimacion, seeing that God of his own accord, had given that, which
was of more excellency. Than Peter, as though that he would do nothing
without the consent of the Jews, though he had already purposed it, said to
them that came with him: Is there any man here that will say nay, but that
these men may be chrystened, albeit they be not circumcysed, which have
received the holy ghost as well as we? And when as no man said contrary, he
commanded them to be christened in the name of Jesus Christ. All this matter
being happily finished, as Peter was making himself ready to return to Ioppa,
they entreated him to tarry with them a few days, for as much as they were
very desirous to have more perfect knowledge of the gospel. Peter being thus
entreated, was content to abide. For he knew that the Jews would scarsely
brook it, that he should be in household conuersaunt with them, that were not
circumcised.

The.xi. Chapter.

THe rumor of this fact, came over to the other apostles ears which remained
at Jerusalem, and to the ears of the brethren also, which were abroad in
Iewry, that the gentyles had also received the word of God. For it was an
hard thing to keep this matter close, partly because this captain was by
reason of his office, of so great estimation, and partly again for that many
were Christened together, either else because the Jews were present at the deed
doing (for the chaumberlaine that we spoke of before, when he was Christened
as he rode by the way, was alone without wytnes, as one that had stolen the
benefitte of the gospel from the Jews) and partly also because it was done
in one of the noble cities of Palestine. But Peter knowing certainly that it
would be noysed abroad, and that there would some Jews reprove this his
doing, took diligent head every way, that he might not deserve any rebuke,
forasmuch also as God had put this in his mind, which had showed him this
vision three times, because he should nothing stycke to do it. On the other
part, by reuelacyon of the holy ghost, he perceived that messangiers were
come from Cornelyus: whom he forthwith did not receive into the house, lest
he being a Jew might have seemed to have been desirous to compaynye with the
heathen, but spoke to them at the door, and before witnesses asked them why
their cummyng was. This question he asked rather for the Jews sakes that were
present, then for his own. Besides this after he perceived that the vysions
did agree, both on the one part and the other, he went thither, but yet not
without the compainy of some Jews, which were known to be men of good
credence, who should bear witness what were done, and without whose consent he
would do nothing to thentent that by these means afterward, if any man
would grudge at his doings, they, as witnesses, might become proctours of his
cause. Again when he was come to Cornelius house, he did not forthwith enter
in, as a man desirous to talk with him, but sent in word to him that he was
come, that Cornelius might meet him and bring him in: and yet was he
nevertheless well assured, that he should be welcum. This captain fell
prostrate at Peter's feet and wurshypped him, which was to all the Jews that
were present, a great token to marvel at, of his ready mind. Again in
hearing of the^ all, he asked what his will was with him, that he had sent for
him, to thentent that the Jews, which came with him, hearing the tale of
Cornelius own mouth, might the better believe it. And finally the holy ghost
came down by his own accord, before that they had either made their prayers,
either had their hands laid on them, either they had received baptism.
Neither yet did he upon this, christen them, before he had commoned with the
cyrcumcised that were present, and had expressed unto them, that it were not
mete to deny them baptism, whom God had endowed with his holy ghost. This
was that great wisdom of Peter being a pastor and agreeable with the gospel.
He well knew the nature of the Jews, how much they stood in their own
conceyte, because they were circumcised, and how deadly they abhorred those
that were not circumcised. This was the occasyon that he imagined all shyftes
to avoid offense of any manne. He was desirous to make the Gentyles partakers
of the gospel, but yet in such sort, And when Peter was cum up to
Jerusalem they that were of the circumcision contended against him.
that by the occasion thereof, he should not lose the Jews, if it might be.
Now after that Peter had by chance returned to Jerusalem, where, by reason
of the rumors, it was known how Cornelius had been christened, they which
were circumcised and had received the gospel, disputed against him, saying:
wherefore dyddest thou enter into the houses of the uncircumcised contrary to
the tradicion of our forefathers, and not content with that, did also sit
at the same table, and eat those meats which, are forbidden in Moses law?

In this matter it becommed not Peter to hold his peace, but he told all the
matter even from the beginning, how as it had chanced in this wise. Certes I
du^st not break the law which we have delivered us of our forefathers, but
in this poincte followed I him, which is above the law. I was in the city
Ioppa, fasting, and in my prayers, that no man can suspecte it to be a vain
dream. And when I had commanded, (as very hungre enforced me) some meat to
be dressed, I was in the mean time rauyshed, and in a trance saw this
vision. A great vessel much after the form of a great linen sheet, knitte
fast at four corners, was let down from heaven, and came to me. Werupon when
I had set mine iye, being very hungry, I looked what manner of meat there was.

And there I saw diverse kinds of fowerfoted beasts, besides those that were
noxious beasts, with other sondrye kinds also of beasts* that crepe on the
yearthe, and fowls of the air, whom the law by expressed commandment,
would us to abstain fro.

Whiles I was lookyng on this, I heard also a voice which exhorted me that I
should not stick to eat thereof, and said unto me: arise Peter, kill and
eat. To whom I made than answer: God forbid. For to this day has no
unclean meat entered into my mouth. Than answered the voice eftsoon in this
manner: call not thou, which art but man, those meats unclean, which god
has purified. This vysion did three times appear. And afterward all those
meats, which I thought worthy to be abhorred, were taken up into heaven.

And after I was cum to my self, whiles I reuolued in my mind what this
vision, which so often apered, should mean, the spirit of god forthwith
gave me knowledge that there were three men at ye door where I hosted, sent
from Cesarea, that would speak with me. And the same spirit commanded me
that I should not stick to go with them. I obeyed the visyon, and by the
holy ghostes sendyng, I took my journey to Cesarea, not alone, but I took six
brethren with me, to bear witness of all those things, which I did by the
commandment of God. And brefely er entered into the man's house that had
sent for us. There he in presence of us all, showed how that few days
before, whiles he was fasting and his prayers, at home in his house, he had
seen an Angel standing before him in a glistenyng garment, when it was broad
day, and saying unto him. Cornelius, send some of thy servants to Ioppa,
and let them desire Simon, otherwise named Peter, in thy behalf to take the
pains to come speak with the. He shall tell the those things, whereby thou
and all thy household, may be saved. I perceyuyng these visions to had agreed
on both parts, and perceyuyng farther how earnest their desire was with out
all dissimulacion, began to teach them those things that our Lord Jesus
had willed us to preach.

I had not fully fynished my communication, but behold the holy ghost cummyng
from heaven, entered into them, in like manner as he at the first time, had
into us: and they began to speak diverse languages, even as we than spoke.
This was an evident token, that their faith was approved before God. And even
than the very thing it self showed, what this hard vision to understand, that
I had seen, did mean. For these were those same fowerfooted creping beasts,
and fowls, which we that are circumcised, do abhor, but gods will is to
have them purifyed through faith, yea he will not, that we take any thing as
unclean, which through faith of the gospel, is made holy. And farther I
remembered the words that the Lord spoke unto us when he was ready to ascend
to heaven: John baptized in water, but you shall be baptized in the holy ghost.
And we diepe the body in water, but it is not water that gives salvation,
unless by faith we obtain the fierye baptism. And when as the matter of it
self in effect was evident enoughe, that they had received the baptism which
Jesus the lord had promised, and that the same favor through faith, was
employed on those which were not circumcised, which we before had received:
not because we had so deserved by keeping of the law, but through our faith,
whereby we believed our lord Jesus Christ, What was I, that I would have
wythstande god
how could I be against the will of god? Was it for me to stay, that they
should not be baptized in water, which were than already baptized in the
spirit of God, seeing that water is nothing else but a token of the grace that
shall be given us from heaven? But than was grace given them before, without our
ministry. So that to deny them to be baptized in water, had been nothing
else, but to improve that which God had done. When they had heard these his
words, they held their peace, and praised God, saying: than the very thing
in effect is evidently declared, that God has given repentance, not to the
Israelytes only, but to the Gentyles also that they thereby may obtain life
everlasting. And these were the first fruits of the Gospel that the church
had of heathen, by Peter's procurement. For before him, none other durst so
do, but Philip only, and that also not without monicion of an angel

For they that by reason of sore persecucion after Steuens death were
dispersed, went from vyllage to village, and from city to city, until they
came to Phenice, and sum to the Isle Cypres, which lies right over against
Phenice, And y^ have of the lord was with them. etc.
sum also scattered to Antioche, which deuideth Phenyce from Cilicia preaching
to every man the doctrine of the gospel, which they had received of the
Apostles, and yet durst not they communicate it to any man, but those that
were Jews, not because they hated all men besides, but of a certain godly
fear which they had, forasmuch as they thought, that it was not lawful to
give to dogs the holy, which to do the Lord had forbidden them. About
the same time, arose up certain men that were converted to the faith, borne
part in Cypres, and part in Cyrene, which entryng into the city of Antioche,
durst boldly speak of Christ to the Grecians, and preached our Lord Jesus
unto them, and they prospered, the matter succedyng very well, as the will of
God was that it should do, who gave strength and courage to the setters furthe
of his name. For among them also a great number that gave credence to the
gospel, were converted to the Lord.

The knowleage of this matter by noysyng of it abroad, from one to another,
came to the ears of the church which was at Jerusalem. And for this purpose
ye leuite Barnabas, a man which was borne in Cypres, one of such perfeccion,
as was semely for an apostle, was sent thither by the apostles to see what was
dooen there, and that he, if he perceived it to be agreeable to the will of god,
should allow it by the authority of thapostles. So great heed they took in
receyuyng the heathen to be partetakers of the gospel, although thapostles
much desired that it should so be, partelye lest that it should be
afterward called back or broken of the Jews, as a thing unadvisedly or
rashely done, and partly left the gentyles should very much mistruste
theymselues, in that that they had dooen, as though the law of Moses must
have been their help and their stay. And exhorted them al, that with purpose
of heart. etc.
But after that Barnabas was cum to Antioche, and perceived that the Grecians
had obtained them like favor of god through faith, without obseruacion of the
law, as the Jews had, he much rejoiced that the number of the faithful was
increased, and exhorted them all, that they should stand steadfast in their,
purpose, and stycke to God. For he was a good man, and replenished with the
holy ghost. they would continually cleue unto the lord. etc.
And therefore came it to pass by means of his preaching, that many more did
join with the other number, that professed the Lord. And because that
Antioche is adjoining to Cilicia, the very nerenesse of the place, moved him to
seek for Paul, which was more meet for this office, than any other,
forasmuch as he was chosen of Christ to glorify his name among the Gentiles,
and princes of the yerth. For the disciples had brought him to Cesarea, a city
of Phenice, what time he fled from Jerusalem, and thence he went to Tarsus.

Whom, after he had found there, he brought to Antioche, because he hoped to win more by his means which was an apostle, specially chosen to this office,
in so great a city as that was, and so much frequented both of Grecians, and
also Jews.

And so they continued together at Antioche a whole year, with the congregation
of the faithful, that were there gathered together in a great number, as well
of Grecians, as of Jews, which was afterward much increased by access of
no small multitude of people, gathered together by the preaching of Paul and
Barnabas, insomuche that they, which before were called disciples, (because
the name of Christ was odious) at Antioche first were called of the
principal author of their religion, al Christians that professed Christ's
doctrine.

About this season certain Prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioche, among
whom, one, whose name was Agabus, standing up in the congregation, inspired
with the spirit of God, certified them that there should come great famyne
over all the whole woorlde. The which came to pass in Claudius Cesars time
that succeeded Caligula. And because that the Jews, which were converted to
the faith, and dwelled in Jerusalem, were for the most part poor men and
partly had given all that they had in commen, and many of them by reason that
they professed Jesus Christ's name had been spoiled of their goods by the
priests, they provided that those which had abundantlye enough, specially
amongst the Gentyles, and had received the gospel, should every man give a
portion, and the money so gathered, should be sent to ye christen men that
dwelled in Iewrye, for their sustentacion so that no maunne was compelled to
give any thing, but that every man should give that, that he could find in
his heart with a good will to depart withal, according to the value of his
goods. And even as they had ordained, so was it done, And ye same money was
sent to Jerusalem by Paul and Barnabe to the elders that they should
distribute it as they thought best, to those that had need thereof.

The.xii. Chapter.

While that Paul and Barnabas were occupied about this embassade, King
Herod, which had before time beheaded John, and sent Christ again to
Pilate, apparelled with a white garmente in a mockage, being sorye that this
sort of men daily increased, and that the name of Jesus, King of the Jews,
was well known in many countries, thought it to appertain to his duetye,
that this sect so growing and daily encreasyng, And ye same time Herod the
king stretched furthe his hands. etc.
should be clean vanquyshed: Sathanas even than woorkyng eftesones by them,
as by his tools, the same thing which he before went about, but yet obteyning
nothing else thereby, but that the name of Jesus was more gloryously set forth.

Therefore Herod practysyng his regal and absolute power, sent certain of
his guard with weapons, to lay hand on some of the congregacyon that professed
Jesus of Nazareth, Lord of all things. And so he which in choppyng of John's
head, had learned to behead good men, and those that freely spoke the truth,
did now likewise lay hands upon James thapostle, brother to John, because he
in those days was esteemed of greatest authority among the other apostles, and
commanded him to be headed which steadfastly continued in professyng the name
of Jesus. And when he perceived that this cruel act, did well please the
Jews, he heaped myschiefe upon myschiefe, and commanded that Peter should
be taken, which was chief among the rest of thapostles, thinkyng that it
would come to pass, that the shepehearde being ryd out of the way, the
flock might easily be dispersed and scattered: upon which consyderacyon the
Jews had before slain our lord Jesus, staying their hands from the
apostles. He would immediately and without delay have put Peter to death, Than
were the days of swetebread.
but only that their Easter day, which was had in great honor among the
Jews, was at hand, at which time the Jews before had been also afraid to
slay Jesus. Such is the Jews devotion in keeping their holy days. They are
not afraid to sacryfice an innocent man's blood at the peoples request, but
they are afraid to break their holy day, as though that he were nothing
gyltie of murder, which has in heart prefixed to commyt murder. He than
commanded that Peter being thus taken, should be cast into prison, and for
fear lest he should any way escape, like as Paul had, he set sixteen
harneste men to keep him lying in bands, to thinte^t that no man might by
force take him away. For he had purposed, after the holy days to bring this
sacrifice before the people, that even thirsted for innocente blood. Like
people like king. In the mean season neither refused Peter to go to prison,
having knowledge before by God, that such things should happen, neither
made the disciples any commocion against the ungodly cruelnes of this tyrant,
having well in remembrance, how the Lord had commanded, that they should
wyshe nothing but well, yea to those that pursued them. Herod was not
satisfied with imprysonyng of Peter, ne with double chains, nor with once
four soldiers in armor, which in other times and cases were thought
enoughe to have the safe keeping of one man, for this purpose verily, that his
cruel entente with so great diligence, might much more avail to the setting
forth and encreasyng of the glory of our savior Christ. In this wise Peter,
whom the soldiers took diligent head on, kept his holy day in prison. In the
mean while the congregation of the disciples, taking not a little thought for
their shepeherde, never teassed day ne night to pray to God, that Peter might
escape.

And when as Herod purposed to bring him forth before the people after the
holy days were ended, as God would, and nyghre before he should have been
brought forth, And behold, the angel of the lord was there present. etc.
Peter was a sleep between two soldiers bound with two chains. The rest of
the soldiers watched at the prison door. And behold thangell of god suddenly
stood by Peter, and a wonderful light withal made all the house bright
notwithstanding that it was both a dark prison, and a dark night also, and
smyting Peter on the side, raised him, saying: Arise speadily. And forthwyth,
as soon as these words were spoken, the chains, fell from his hands. Than
said the angel, gyrde thy self, and put on thy shoes, and see that thou
leave no part of thy apparel hear. When Peter had this done, than said the
angel again: cast on thy cloak and follow me. In this wise Peter following the
Angel his guide began to go forth of the prison, not yet perceiving that
this was in very deed done that the angel did, but supposyng that he saw a
vision, as he had before seen. But after they had passed the first and the
second ward, they came to an iron gate that leads into the city, which by
it own accord, opened unto them, though it had many locks and boltes upon
it. And they went out and passed. etc.
And when they were clean forth, they passed on until they had gone through
one street of the city, and than forthwith the angel vanishyng away, left
Peter, as soodaynly as he before had comen to him.

forth to harken, named i^ hoda. And wha^ she knew Peter's voice, she opened
not the entry for gladness, but tanne in and told how Peter stood before the
entry. And they said unto her, thou art mad. But she affirmed that it was even
so. Than said they: it is his ^ungell. But Peter contin^ed knocking: and when
they had opened the door, and saw him, they were asto^ied. And when he had
beckened unto them with the hand that they might hold their peace, he told
them by what means the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said:
go show these things unto James, and to the brer^r^. And he departed, and
went into an other place. Then Peter lookyng about him, and perfectly knowing
in what part of the city he was, cummyng to himself, said: Now I perceive
it is no dream that is done, but the Lord pytiynge those that be his, has
sent his Angel, and has delivered me out of the hands of Herod, which
had decreed to put me to death, and has disappoynted both the cruel king,
and also the earnest expectacion of the multitude. And as he considered the
thing, he came to the house of Mary. etc.
Than as he was in consultynge and devising with himself whither he might
most safely go, thynkyng that he would make his dysciples and fellows to be
partakers of this his joyful chaucne, went to the house of Mary that was the
mother of John, not the same John that was brother to James, but that was
otherwise called Mark, in whose house many were assembled, praying with one
assente, for the delyuery of their pastoure.

And when Peter knocked at the wicket of the gate which was toward the
streate side, a little maiden came forth softely to harken what the matter
was. Her name was Rhoda. Whom Peter perceyuyng to come to the door, wylled
her spedely to open the door. When she heard Peter's voice, being half amassed
for sooddayn joy, did not open the door, but runnyng back again into the
house, brought them word that Peter was at the door. But they being well
assured how safe Herod had caused Peter to be kept, answered to the
maiden. Surely thou art peuyshe. But when she continued styffely affirmyng
that it was true that she had said, some of them said, it is not Peter but
his ghost, or angel that speaks like him. For they were of this opinion,
that every man has an Angel to be his keeper and guide, But Peter continued
knockyng. etc.
which often times would take man's lykenes upon him. But when as Peter
still knocked, they opened the door, and when they saw Peter come in, they
woondred at him. But Peter hearing the great noise of those that rejoiced that
he was come again, beckened to them with his hand, that they should hold
their peace, and harken without noise what he would say, lest that any
manne should perceive the matter, that had chanced, by so strange and
unaccustomed noise that they made. When silence was made, he showed them all
the matter as it had chanced in order, how the Lord had brought him out of
the prison, by the guydyng of his angel. And look, said Peter, that James
the brother of the Lord, be certified hereof (he was than bysshope of
Jerusalem) and the rest of the brethren, And he departed and went into an
other. place.
that they may be partakers with us of this joy. In this wise the good God
does myxte sadness with myrthe, and myrthe with sadness, that we should
not vttrely despair. After Peter had spoken these words, he forthwith
departed thence, and went into an other place whereas he might more safely be
hid, for fear lest Herod, whose contynual endeavor in cruelty he had
experyence of, should again epsy him out.

becum of Peter. When Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he
examined the kepers, and commanded them to be had away. And he descended from
Iewry to Cesarea, and there abode. Herod was dyspleased with them of Tire and
Sydon. But they came all with one accord, and made intercession unto one
Blastus the kings chaumbers said, and desired peace, because their country
was nourished by the kings prouysion. But as soon as it was day the
soldiers, to whose custody he was committed, seeing the chains remain whole,
and that the prisoner was escaped (the doors being shut) were sore amassed,
maruaylyng what was become of Peter. And Herod, when he had sent for Peter,
to thyntente that he might bring him forth before the people, and so to
condemn him to death, and found him not in the prison, after examynacyon
had of the kepers, commanded them to ward, that he might at laysure put
them to execucion. But God ever mercyfully tenderyng those that love him,
restrained Herodes rage, as well prouydyng for the safetye of the Apostles, as
also of the soldiers. For it was not sytting that the safegarde of Peter
should, be occasion that the innocents should suffer the pains of death.
And in the mean space it it befell that Herod had occasion to take his journey
to Cesarea, a city of Palestine. He was offended with thinhabitours of Tire
and Sydon, and did even than purpose in his mind, to wage battayll against
them. But they hearing of that, repaired with one accord unto him, and first
desiryng the favor of one Blastus, which was chyefe of the kings privy
chaumbre, and obteyning the same, sued for peace, forasmuch as they thought it
expedient for them to have the frendshyppe of him, being a king that dwelte so
nere them: Because that their riches and welthynes in Tire and Sydon, stood
most by marchaundysynge, and therefore it was their commodity and vauntage,
to be at league with the countries that adjoined nere unto them, and that they
could not wage battle, without their great hynderaunce, having not free
passage for occupiers to carry out, and bring in marchaundises.

After these matters were p^acibly ended, when as upon a certain solemn
feast, or high day, that was by vow kept holy for the health of the
Emperor, by occasion whereof the chief rulers of the whole country were
assembled thither, the second day that the plays were kept, (for they
continued many days) Herod was speaking unto the people out of an high place
or pulpet before the people, having on him a gorgeous garmente that was very
richely and coningly wouen and enbrodered, with both silver and also gold:
when that the brightenes of the Sun beams shyning on the la^ and bosom of
the kings garment, by reason of refleccio^, glistered upon every man's iyes,
that no man might abide the bryghtenes thereof, even as it had been lyghtening,
The voice of god and not of a man. etc.
the multitude with flattery made a shout thereat, praysyng him, and said: the
voice of god and of no man, as though they had perceived in him some thing to
surmount man's excellency. Such flattery of the people, does often cause the
kings become tyrau^tes, when they are praised as gods, that are scarsely
worthy the name of man. And princes on the other part flatter the people,
exhibiting unto them shows to gase upon, and uncleanly plays, and oftentimes
by putting good men to death, as he before had obtained the peoples favor
by the death of James. And yet Herod for his part refused not, nor abhorred
this so ungodly flattery, but as a wretched person, and one that should within
short space after dye, reioysed to be called god. But the vengeance of god
immediately lighted on him. For straight ways in presence of the multitude,
before he came down, the angel of god smote him, whom; he lokyng back saw,
because that he being man, had taken on him the honor that cannot be
communicate or parted with any creature, but is due unto god alone. And being
taken with a sudden disease, which was as fylthy and dolorouse as any might
be, died for the veraie pain and anguishe thereof, within few days after, his
body being eaten up with vermyne.

In this wise when he, And he was eaten with wourmes, and gave up the ghost.
etc.
that had persecuted the flock of god, was rydde out of the way the doctrine
of the gospel increased, and spread more and more abroad. And Barnabas and
Saul, when their business was done, that they had in hand by the consent of
the brethren, and had delivered the money to ye apostles, and seen the same
distributed to the helpyng and relyuing of ye pore, as it was ordained that it
should, returned from Jerusalem to Antioche, bryngyng with them a companion,
whose name was John, otherwise called by his syrname Mark.

The.xiii. Chapter.

THe Church at Antioche, did than so floryshe, that in it were diverse that had
the gift of Prophecye, and other that had the gift of teaching the same.
Among whom were Barnabas, and Simeon, which was surnamed Niger, and besides
these were also Lucius, a Cyrenian borne, and Manahen which had been brought up
eue^ of a child with Herod the Tetrache, and was his noursefelowe, and
playfiere, whose coumpaignie he had left, and did than follow Christ. But Saul
among all these, was most excellent, and one that passed all the other in
qualyties required in an apostle.

And whereas they studied for the profyt of the Church, bestowyng those gifts
that they had, to each man's wealth, and to set forth the glory of Chrys^e
faithfully, which is a sacrifyce so acceptable to god, that there is none
more, fasting in the mean space, that they by prayer in purity of life,
might further the profytes of the Church, besides the executing and doing of
al other duetyes: the holy ghost being moved with their prayers, certifyed
them by Prophets what he would have done, saying: disseuer me Barnabas and
Saul, two the chief of all the rest, for my purpose, that they may take in
hand that effyce, And when they had fasted and prayed, and ^^ted their hands
on the^, they leat the^ go.
for the which I have specially chosen them: that is to say, that they may
be instructours of the gentiles, and that I may sow far abroad the gospel
by their means. At this commandment of the holy ghost, Barnabas, and Saul
were separated and set apart from the rest, that it might appear to every man,
who were chosen. And after that they ^yth one consent, by fasting, and prayer
had made peticion to God that he would turn the office that they took on them
to ye profit of the congregation: those that were highest of authority among
them, laid their hands on them, and so dimissed them ready to take their
journey, whythersoeuer the holy ghost would lead or appoynte them. And so
first by mocion of the holy ghost, Barnabas and Saul went to Seleucia, which
is a great promontory, or peake on the weste part of Antioche, and thence they
sailed unto Cypres. And as soon as they had arrived at Salamin, And they had
John to their minister.
which is a noble city in that Isle, and ye first that ye cum unto on ye east
side, they preached not fables invented by man's wit, but the word of god:
and that not in corners, but in the Jews Synagoges, of whom there was a
great noumber, by reason that it was nere unto Syria. They had with them, as a
partaker of this mynysterie, John otherwise called Mark, whom they had
brought with them from Jerusalem. Such honor was every where given to the
Jews, according to the commandment of Christ, that wylled the gospel
first to be offered them, lest that sort of people, which otherwise was ever
full of complayntes and waywarde, should say, that they were despised and
naught set by.

They being thus occupied, walked about all the whole Ylande, until that they
came to Paphos, which was a city dedicate in the honor of Uenus. For this
city stands fardest of, on the West part of Cipres. There they found a
certain enchaunter whose name was Bariesus, as a man would say, the son
of Jesus, a Jew borne, and one that professed the Jews religion, and under
pretense thereof, falsely bearyng men in hand, that he had the spirit of
prophecy. He was reteynyng to Sergius Paulus, which was proconsull, that is
to say lieutenaunt, or the lord deputy of that Yland, and was a wise man and
of good experience. For such fellows had wont commonly to get them in such
great men's favor, that they may do more mischief among men, when they have
once brought them in error. The proconsul hearing than that the gospel was
sowed throughout Cypres, did not only not withstand it, but also sent for
Barnabas and Paul, being very desirouse to learn of them this heavenly
doctrine. But Gariesus being an enemy to our savior Jesus, endeavored
himself to resyste the increase of the ghospel, and striued against the truth
which was cumming to light, where as he was in very deed a woorker of
falsehood. And Elimas, which word in the Sitians language betokens an
inchaunter and a false prophet also, withstode the apostles that were true
prophets. For he perceiving that the procunsul was desirous to hear the
gospel, and well assured that in time to come, there would be no place for his
deceitful crafts among them that had once learned the sure and steadfast
truth, went about to alienate the proconsulles mind, that he should no more
believe the apostles. Here mark the buckling together of man's crafts, O thou
full of all suttelrie and deceitfulnes thou child of the deiuel. etc.
and the lively force of the gospel. Saul which was also named Paul, could
no longer forbear this fellow, whom he perceived full of the deiuils spirit,
that striued with myscheuous crafts against the pure truth, but taking to
him hertie courage, by inspiracion of the holy ghost, steadfastly looked on this
enchaunter, and said unto him: O thou wicked, full of all deceit and wylynes,
that expresseste thy father the deiuyll, which first by his wiles and lies
drew man to death. O enemy of al justice and truth, and in this showing thy
self to be the son of the devil, for he first took from man his
innocence, thou openly striuest that truth shall not spring again. And thou
art not contented that thou hitherto have deceived simple men with thy
deceitefull crafts but now also when the will of god is, And now behold the
hand of the lord is upon the, and thou shall be blind. etc.
that the truth of the gospel, in which is no deceit, shall shine throughout
the world, thou stubbernely continuyng in thy eiuyll in^ent, do not cease
to strive against the will of god, rather having an iye to thine own vain
glory and filthy lucre, than to the health and salvation as well of thine own
soul as of a great sort of other men's also. And that thou may perceive
that the crafts which thou workest by the deiuils power, can nothing
prevail against the truth of the gospel, behold thou shall now feel what
he is hable to do, whose will thou do withstand. Thou braggest that thou
art a Prophet, and one that knows high mysteries, whereas in very deed, thou
art inwardely in thy soul blind. Here haste thou deceived men, who judge of
those things that they see, but God that knows the blyndnesse of thy heart,
shall straight ways take away the use of thy bodily iyes, that every man
shall perceive that thou art blind in very deed, and one that is unworthy to
see the same light which all other men see, forasmuch as thou wagest open
war against the light of the gospel, that now begins to arise in the
world. This way shall God take vengeance on the until that thou repent.
Paul had scarcely spoken these words, but suddenly this enchauntoure was
stricken with a great blyndnesse, insomuch that he, as one amassed wandered up
and down, seeking for some man to lead him by the hand. These things were
done, the proconsul being a wytnes of it, and lookyng thereon, who merueylyng
much at the great efficacy of this heavenly doctrine, by virtue whereof the
Fantastical woorkynge of such enchauntours was trod so soon under foot,
was converted to the faith and professed the name of Christ, and instead of
the false Prophet Bariesus he had in high favor the dysciples of Jesus.

the Prophets, the rewlers of the synagoge sent unto them, saying: ye men and
brethren* if ye have any sermon to exhort the people, say on. These things
were done at the city of Paphos, from whence Paul sailing with his company
into the less Asia, landed at Perga, which is a city of Pamphilia. But John
which by surname was called Mark, went from them, and returned to
Jerusalem, whence he before came to bear Barnabas and Paul company. But
they with no less spedynes when they had gone over Pamphilia, came to
Antioche, which is a city of Pisidia. There entering into the Synagogue, where
as the Jews did customably resort, they sat down as other men did, to hear
a lesson of the law, and of the Prophets, which after it was rehearsed, and
no man arose up, the chief rulers of the Synagoges perceiving by their
garments and apparel, that these strangers were of the Jews, and that their
face and outward behaueour showed them to be virtuous men, sent word unto
them by their under officers, that forasmuch as they were Jews, if any of
them would teach, or give any exhortacion to the people, it should be
lawful for them so to do.

Than the heavenly orator Paul, being ready to show his mind, arose,
signifying to the multitude with moving of his hand, that they should hold
their peace, began to speak unto them in this wise. Ye men of Israel which
according to the trade of your forefathers, stand in fear of god, harke^
unto me whiles I shall show unto you the will of God, and expound the
misterye, or meaning of this lesson, which is every Sabbath day customablye
read, in your Synagogue. God the defendour of the Israelites, chose our
forefathers, that is to say, The god of this people choose our fathers. etc.
this sort of people, to serve him before all other, insomuche that when they
served in Egipte, being kept in great seruytude and bondage, Pharao
endeuouringe himself by all means, that they should not increase, and that
they that remained there on live, should be oppressed by excess of paynfull
labor, he wonderfully set them up through miracles, against the tyranne
that oppressed them, and delivered them of their bondage, not by mean of any
craftye deceit, or else by man's policy and strength, but by his high and
mighty power, yt all men might certainly know, that this people was favored of
God. And when as he of a tender love toward them, had delivered them out of
Egypt, very gently he bare with their condycions in the wyldernes by the space
almost of fowerty years, though they often made sedicions, and commocions,
and grutched against Moses: And yet did not he extremely punyshe them, to the
end that he might perform his promise which he had made before unto the
patriarchs.

After fowertye years completed and expired, he brought them to the land that
he had promised, and when he had for their sakes clean vanquyshed seven
nations within the land of Chanaan, the same land parted he by lottes amongst
them, and that within the term of.CCCC. years. Which was an euidente token
how ernestly he loved our country. And so when they had obtained peace, he
gave them judges, under whose governance they might quietly live, until the
time of Samuel the Prophet, which was last of the judges. And afterward,
they desired a king, and god gave unto them Saul the son of Cis.
In time of his rule, they desired of god, that he would give them a king
(Samuel disswadyng them from it) and when as they continued still in the same
mind and desire, he made Saul king over them, that was the son of Cis, of
the tribe of Benjamin, whom the lord rejected, partly for his pride, and
partly for dysobeying his commandment. And thus continued they under the
domynion of the good judge Samuel, and under the ungodly Saul, fowerty years.
Yet for all this, the favor of the merciful god forsook not us his people
whom he had once chosen, but instead of an evil king, whom they had
contrary to the will of God desired, he faysed up unto them king Dauyd, of
whose ryghteousnes god him self bare witness* saying: I have found David the
son of Iesse, a man to my mind, which shall obey my will in all things.
For even as god, what time he is angry, for a great punishment, gives unto
the people a foolish and an ungodly king, even so when he is pleased and
reconciled unto us, he gives for the evil king, whom he lays out of the
way, a good man, and one that will fulfill his commandment.

Unto him had GOD made a promise, that one of his ly^nage should become King
of Israel, who should raygne for ever. Now is it at length fulfilled, which
oftentimes and long ago, was by the prophets promised. For of the stock of
David, according to his promise, he has exhibited unto us Jesus the salvioure
of the Israelites, his name right well agreeyng with theffecte ensuinge
thereof. This saluioure, as he was promised of the Pophetes, and as he was
signified before in shadows of the law, and fygures: so before he showed
himself to the world, he was prophesied and spoken of, and also was showed to
be already cum, by the mouth of John the ^^ptiste, who also was sent before,
according to the prophecye of Esaye, is a messenger to show that he was
cummyng, exhortinge all the people of I^a^^to be baptized, and to repent
their life which they had led before, openly ^onouncinge, that the kingdom
of god was even at hand. But when Ion, (whom god purposely sent to be the
foremessenger of our saluiour which was cummynge, and to make ready the minds
of men against he came ^alalmoste made an end of his course, and was thought
of many for his go^d iuing to be Christ, he openly rejected this title from
him, and referred it to him that it was dew unto, saying: Why think ye that I
am Christ? I am nothing else but his messenger. And yet he, whom ye (though in
deed not truly) suppose me to be, will within short space cum. For he, as
concerning t^me, shall cum after me, but so far he passes me in power and
dignity, that I am far unworthy, yea to unbuckle his shoes, which among men
is acoumted but an homely office, and a base service. For what is in him of
least ^putacion, the same does far surmounte that that is in me most
excellent. Wherefore we preach unto you no new thing, but that the same
saluiour is now come, that has so many hundred years sense, been promised to
our forefathers, and which has so long time ben looked for of your own
selves, whom John, which among the Jews was in great estimacion, knowledged
to be the same saluioure, and so pronounced openly of him before the Jews.

Wherefore brethren ye that have the law in price, and that greatly regard the
prophets, and that come of Abraham's lineage, to whom god promised issue, by
mean whereof, all nations should be blessed, if you be the children of Abraham
in very deed, if ye earnestly stand in the fear of god, follow in this point
the godliness of your father Abraham, and receive this wholesome doctrine that
we bring unto you, and embrace him being now already come, and being lively
exhibited and given to you in very deed, whom the Patriarchs did most highly
rejoice to have no more but promised unto them, For the inhabitours of
Jerusalem. etc.
that he should come. This health of soul through Jesus, is indifferently
brought to all men, but unto you especially is it proffered, to whom, and for
whose salvation the prophecies were disclosed, and of whose stock Christ was
borne. Let not the vulgar example of them that inhabit now Jerusalem move
you any thing, or of those that be rewlers there, which in condemning Jesus to
death, whom they would not knowleage for their Messiah, nor understand the
Prophets which yet be read every sabbath day to them, has unawares
fulfilled that, that was before prophesied. For so was it determined by the
will of god, and so did the Prophets with one consent, signify and declare
before, that one that was free from al sin, should be sacrifysed as a lamb
without spotte, for the sins of all men. And what the priests, Pharisees,
Scribes, and other of the piers, with the conseite also of the commons, had
assayed all means, and could find no just c^use why they should put him to
death, yet obtained they with importun^ clamours of Pilate, that he would put
him to death. And when they ha^ this unadvisedly fulfilled all those things
that were spoken before of hy^ by the mouth of the prophets, they took him
down from the cross, a^^ ^ayed him in his grave. But he whom man of malice
had slain by the permission of god, But God ceysed him again from death on
ye third day etc.
the very same was raised from death, by the power lykew^se of God the third
day, according as it was before prophesied. And lese^^ should think this to
be but a vain tale that I tell you, he was seen ^^arde, felt, and in his own
person, known of his dysciples that followed him, when he went from Galile to
Jerusalem to suffer, by the space, after he rose from death to life, of
fowertie days, and they be almost all aliu^ vnt^ll this day, testifying
faithfully before all the people those things that they saw with their eyes,
and heard with their ears, and felt with their hands.

As concerni^^ that he raised him up from death, now no more to return to
corrupcio^, he (...) wise. The holy promises to David made, will I give
faithfully to you. ^^^fore, he says also in an other place. Thou shall not
suffer thine holy to see corrupcio^. For David (after he had in his time
fulfilled ye will of god) fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and
saw corrupcion, but he whom god raised again, saw no corrupcio^. And we
likewise being commanded by our savior to execute the office of apostles, do
witness that god has now fulfilled his promise to you and your posterity, in
raising Jesus from death to life: which thing long ago was promised to
Abraham, and David your forefathers, and to your other auncest^^^ by the
mouths of the prophets. For this is the same son of god, borne of the
virgin Mary as concerning his humayne nature and body, of whom the father
himself speaks in the first mystical psalm saying: thou art my son I
have begotten the this day. And that he has raised him from death to life,
who shall never after be more subject to mortality or death, he affirms by
his prophet Esaye saying: I will perforume unto you faithfully, the promise
that I made unto David. Now had he kept no promise, if he had not raised Jesus
to life everlasting. For this was his promise unto David: I have once sworn to
David, as I am holy, and I will not deceive him, his seed shall continue for
ever, and his throne, or royal seat, shall continue as the Sun in my sight,
and as the full Moon without end, and as a faithful witness in heaven. But
ye see now that none of the lynage of David, obtayneth this kindom: but this
prophecy signified Christ, that sits on the right hand of his father, and
enjoys the kingdom that never shall have end. Of this self same matter,
speaks also the.xv. psalm in this wise: Thou shall not suffer thy holy to
see corrupcion. Which prophecy can not be referred to king David in his own
person, of whom we certainly know, that after that he had lived and reigned
as long as pleased god, he than died, For David (after he had in his time
fulfilled the will of God) fell on sleep. etc
and was buried sembleably as his auncestry was before him. But if to see
corrupcion be nothing else but to die, than his grave, which yet unto this day
is remaining among us where his bones lie, does evidently prove, that he has
seen corrupcion. Wherefore this prophecy cannot be referred unto him but to
the other, whom we preach unto you of, whom god raised from death to life ^re
his body began to putrify, and made him immortal.

Be it therefore known unto you brethren, that through thaforesayde Jesus, ye
have proffered unto you remission of sins, and freedom from all offenses,
which you could not hitherto be clean rid of, by keeping of the law. For
the law was imperfect, taken carnally, neither could it put away all sins,
but punished sum of them, nether it helped all nations. But through this same
Jesus, each man without respect of any person or else offense, has
righteousness or iustificacion, and innocence proffered unto him, so that he
believe the promyses of the ghospel. Beware therefore, lest it may be spoken of
you, that god threteneth to the unfaithful, and those that resist the
preaching of his gospel, saying by the mouth of his prophet Abacuc: Look ye
dispisers, and maruayle ye being amassed, and even dye for anger, for I work
in your days a work that ye shall not believe, though a man tell you of it.
Who ever yet did believe that a virgin should bear a child? Who would have
thought that all countries should obtain life everlasting by the death of one
man? Who would have believed that a man being slain and buried, could within
three days arise again from death to life everlasting? This wondrefull
work, god, according to his promise heretofore made, has wrought now in
your time. Become not ye despisers, be not occasion that your selves perish
through stubberne and wylfull unbelief, but believe ye in him, and embrace ye
that health of soul which is now freely proffered unto you.

After Paul had concluded, and she hearers began to depart, they desired
Paul and Barnabas, that they would speak more of the same matters the
sabbath day next following in audience of the synagoge. And when the cumpany was
dimissed, many that were partly Jews borne, and partly other strangers
which yet lived according to the trade of the Jews, and were likewise
desirous to know this kind of religion, followed Paul and Barnabas, coveting
to be more plainly, and familiarely taught of the Apostles. And than talked
they with them aparte, exhortinge them to continue in that favor and grace
which once they had begun to embrace, of free gift at the hand of god, and
what they had once begun, in the same to proceed with continual increase. In
the mean time the rumoure of this matter was publisshed far abroad, one
telling another what he had hard as men commonly do.

So the next sabbath day not only the Jews, and such straungiers as
observed the Jews laws, but also all the whole city came to the Synagoge to
hear the gospel preached. But the Jews for the most part of them, that had
persuaded themselves, that this favor through believing the gospel, was
promised to such only as were carnally dyscended and came of Abraham's stock,
when they saw that a great multitude of Jews, and such other as kept their
law, (which were proselites, and Gentiles also,) were gathered together
indifferently, the said Jews grudgeyng in their mind, dysdayned at it
meruelou^y, speaking against such things, as had been spoken of by Paul* and
not absteyning from unsitting, oprobrius, and railing words. When Paul and
Barnabas perceived their malicious stubbernes, remembering that the lord had
commanded the apostles, that if in any place they chanced to mete with such,
as would reiecte the gospel when it is proffered them, they should leave
that city and place, shaking the dust of their feet also to such stubberne
persons again, said freely: we have done out duties: For according to the
commandment of Jesus the lord, the gospel first was to be preached unto you.
Such reputacion Christ had you in. But seeing that you refuse so great favor
that has been freely and without suyte proffered unto you, and think your
selves unworthy of eternal life, behold we will turn our preaching to the
Gentiles. And yet will not we so do upon our head: But Jesus our lord so
commanded his disciples, that after they had preached his gospel throughout
Iewry, they should afterward preach it to all nations unto the end of the
world. This was long since prophesied by the prophet Esaias, that Jesus should
save, not the Jews only, but all the nations also in the world. For in his
book of prophecy, the father speaks unto the son in this wise: I have set
the to be a light unto all nations, and to save all the whole world.

When those that were of the gentiles heard this, they much rejoiced, not
because that the Jews should perish, but so that they rendered to God
thanks, that had turned the Jews incredulity unto their salvation.

The Jews spoke blasphemously against this healthful doctrine: but the
gentiles being suddenly converted, did receive it very promptly, and readily,
and glorified the word of the lord. Which word many of the gentiles
believed, but yet not all, but as many as god of his mercy had ordained to have
everlasting life, whereunto no man attayneth, unless he be called, and
chosen of god. In this wise the word of god was sown abrod thorowout all that
country. But the Jews envying the gentiles, stirred up certain devout women
(for such commonly are sooneste deceived under the feigned pretense of
holiness) and those that were in estimacion honorable, And the word of ye
lord was published throughout all ye regio^.
to thentent that all might be done with the more autoritic: and furthermore
they moved diverse of the head men of the city, and through them, caused Paul
and Barnabas to be persecuted, and banished them out of their coasts.

Here mark, good Theophilus, the craft, that the Jews had to stir up the
minds of men against those, that sincerely preached Jesus. Malice first
moves them that do counterfeit holiness, and soon after thinwarde sorrow of
their malicious minds, breaks out into words of reproach. Than upon this,
sad women, and such as be devout, be means whereby they call the commons unto
sedicion, for by the aunciente matrones they stir up the rewlers. And in this
wise were the Apostles drieuen out. Than Paul and Barnabas shaking of from
them the dust of their feet, took their journey to Iconium, which is a city
in Licaonia. The disciples also rejoicing that the gospel had so good
success, were replenished with gladness and with the holy ghost.

The.xiiii. Chapter.

BUt ^han as they were come to Iconium, they went together as their custom
was, into the Synagoge of the Jews, and there they preached also the gospel
of Jesus Christ, like as they had before done at Antioche, insomuch that a
great number as well of Jews, as of Grecians, were converted to the faith. Here
again likewise ye Iewishe malice was occasion of sedicion. For ye Jews that
would not obey the gospel, being not content to perish themselves, except
they might draw many with them to damnacion, stirred up and corrupted the
minds of the gentiles, against them yt did believe. But the gospel increased
and waxed stronger, as well by adversity, as by prosperity. Wherefore Paul
and Barnabas continued a long space in this fight at Iconium, valiantly
setting forth the matter, by the help of god, which bare witness (which
was greater than any testymony of man) to this his free gift, that he exhibited
to al men through his gospel. For power he gave to these his preachers of the
ghospel, that were but weak persons, and out of reputacion, to work signs
and wonders, to thentent that it might be known thereby, to be the very
handye work of god. So by mean of the Jews, the city Iconium was divided
in two parts, of which th^ne favored the unfaithful Jews, the other
thap^stles.

And at the last, when they that were of the gentiles, adjoining themselves to
the Jews, and gouernoures of the city, went about to lay violent hands on
thapostles, that they might punish and stone them, they having knowledge of the
matter, f^ed to Listra, a city in Licaonia, which is part of Pamphilia and
from thence to Derba. In the mean space they walked over all coasts of the
country that were near, sowing in every place, seed of the gospel, so that
in this their flight the apostles did not so much procure their own health,
as spread abroad the ghospel.

There was the same time in Listra a certain manne, whose legs were so feeble
and impotent, that he continually satte still, nothing hable to walk and was
lame even from his mothers womb, neither could he go of all the days in his
life before. This man among the other multitude, heard Paul speaking of
Christ, and Paul looking upon this man, perceived by his countenance, how
earnest and desirous he was to hear him, because he trusted, that by the name
of Jesus which he had heard preached, he should obtain health of his
limbs, and said unto him with a loud voice: Stand up on thy feet, and with
that word this lame man leaped up and was well hable to go. But when the
multitude saw this wo^^^e (for there was no man but he knew this lame creature,
and that with one word he was restored unto his health) they spoke with loud
voices in their own country language of Licaonia, and said: doubtless the
gods have taken on them the likeness of men, And they called Barnabas Jupiter,
and Paul Mercurius. etc.
and have descended from heaven unto us. And the people of Licaonia did so
much more persuade themselves that it was so, because there went commonly
certain talks of Jupiter, and Mercurius how they being gods, took on them
the likeness of men, and were received as gestes of Licaon, of whom it
appears that they were called Licaonians. Wherefore they called Barnabas by
the name of Jupiter, because he showed in his countenance great gravity and
auncientnes, and Paul they called Mercury, because he was the spokesman: for
the Gentiles were of this opinion that Mercurius was the messengier of the
gods and the president of eloquence. And Jupiters priest, who dwelled in the
subburbes of the city of Listra, brought oxen and garlandes to ye gate of the
house, where the apostles were lodged, to thintente that he would have dooen
sacrifice unto them. For they supposed that Jupiter was most delighted with
sacrifising of oxen. And as well the priests, as also the beasts that were
killed in sacrifice, had wont to wear garlandes. And a great number of all
estates indifferently one with an other, followed him.

But when Paul and Barnabas had enquired what the matter meant, and learned how
they were taken as gods, and that the priest hastened to sacrifice unto them,
they would no longer abide so great blasphemye against god, to have that same
honor that was due to god only, applied to manne, but cuttyng their
garments as the Jews manner was in sorrow, they with haste came forth to the
multitude cryinge, and said: syrs what mean ye? Why do you thus? We are no
gods, but mortal men as ye be, ready and apt to fall into like mischaunces
as you are, and we do not only not desire thus to be honored of you, but
rather we came hither to you for this purpose, that by our counsel ye may
turn to the true living god, that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and
all things whatsoever is contained therein, leaving these false gods, whom
ye have hitherto with heathen sacrifice woorshipped, which in deed are nothing
else, but either men that be now dead, or else images void of life, or finally
evil spirits. For there is but one god the maker and governor of al things.
His will is now to be known and worshipped of all nations in the world, that
all men through him may obtain life everlasting. For in times paste, he,
winking as it were, at men's factes, permitted all nations to live every one
after his own trade, to the end that after it were once euidente that man
could not be saved by his own means, all men might be saved, if they would
believe in god, and the ghospel taught by his son. And although the most
part of men through error, has left the true God, wurshipping images of
diverse things instead of God, or things that were created instead of their
creatoure, yet he by and by did not revenge himself on them, as he justly
might have done, nor ceased not to provoke them to know, and love him, by his
continual benefits.

In geuyng us rain and fruitful seasons. etc.
For he that made the world to the use of man, does make both fruitful, and
plentiful the ground, by sending down rain from heaven, and causes yearly
increase of fruits to suffice abundantly to the use of man's life,
refreshyng us plentyfully with soondry kinds of meats, and stirryng our
hertes, to myrthe, with pleasant wynes. For ye have not received these
benefits of Jupiter, Ceres, or Bacchus, whom ye have hitherto wurshipped, but
of the same god whom we preach unto you. Than although the apostles had so
plainly showed the truth in the hearing of all the multitude, yet they could
scarcely stay their hands, from doing sacrifice unto them.

In the mean space while these things were done at Listres, certain persons
being Jews borne, that repined against the gospel, came thither from
Antioche that is in Pisidia, and from Iconium: which Jews, when they had
turned many of the people to their mind and opinion, that is to say when they
had caused them to lay violent hands upon the apostles which thing they had
also attempted before at Iconium, they stoned Paul and drew him out of the
city, thinking that he had been dead. Thus is man's fortune suddenly changed.
They were but a litel before taken for gods, and should have had sacrifice done
unto them, but now Paul being stoned, was cast out of ye city. For they were
more angry with him, because he by reason of his eloquence, entised many to
follow Christ. Then the disciples compassed him about there as he was cast,
and left for dead, and would have buried the corpse. But Paul cumming to
himself again, arose privily, and entered into ye city, and the next day
fled to Derba with Barnabas, whither they first of all had purposed to have
gone.

And when they had preached the gospel there in that city, and had taught
many things, and (as a man would say) had cast the seed of the gospel
abroad, they returned to Listres, Iconium, and Antioche making the minds of
the disciples steadfast in the faith, as many as they had converted to Christ,
and giving them exhortacion to continue in the faith, and that they would not
for any scare be withdrawn from the trust which they had once put in our
lord Jesus, nor should not be moved because they heard say that Paul was
stoned at Listres forasmuch as Christ had told his disciples, that this was
the way, that through much trouble they should enter into the kingdom of
heaven: So that Paul took more thought, lest those that were weak in the
faith should be alienated from Christ, seeing how sore he was vexed of the
wicked Jews, then that he himself passed so much on it, giving example to
Bisshoppes that they ought to follow thrifty husband men, which think it not
sufficient to plant, or ^o sow except they do also their diligence, that the
same that begins to grow, may come to his full typing.

And forasmuch as it was requisite to the setting forwards of the gospel,
that the apostles should trauail through many countries, they set priests or
auncientes, who were chosen by the voices of the comens of every city, to
ouersee them, and to supply the towmes of the apostles in their absence, and so
when they had used generally prayer and fasting, they committed them to god*
that they might profit in him, whom they had once professed,

These things were done in Antiochia, which is a city in Pisidia, and when
they had walked over that country, they likewise went through Pamphilia,
sowing the gospel in every place, where as it was not sowed already, and
strengthening them that already believed, until they returned to Perga. And
when they had there also set all matters in order, they came to Attalia, which
is a City of Pamphilia, sumwhat near the sea. From thence again they took
shypping to Antioche in Syrya, whence they first came, when the office of
preaching to the Genttiles was committed unto them by the elders, and when by
laying of hands upon them, by prayer, and by fasting, they were committed to
the grace of god, that through his help it might happily come to pass, that
they had taken in hand.

Wherefore when they were returned thither, as men accoumptable for their
doings, they called together the congregation of the faithful, and opened
unto them all such things as it had pleased god to work by them, showing
them that the favor of god had futthered their endeavor, and how he had given
occasion to call the Gentiles to the faith, by which they might obtain
salvation without the observing or keeping of the heavy and burdenous
commandments of the law.

The.xv. Chapter.

Paul and Barnabas continued a long space at Antioche with the dysciples,
because that in so noble a City as that was, a great multitude of faithful
were gathered together of sundry sorts of men, which daily increased more and
more. And the apostles were glad to tarry longer there where the greatter
increase of faithful men was, because the inhabitours of Jerusalem, and of
that part of Syria, which is properly named Iewry, did more stick to Moses
law, than any other: forsomuche as they were less conuersaunte with the
Gentiles: and because that they dwelling more nerer the temple, would not
permyt the Gentiles to be partakers of the gospel, unless they would keep
the law, which they did not yet perceive should be abrogate, as concerning
the shadows, figures, and ceremonies, after the true light was once come. Of
this sort were circumsicion, vacacion, and forbearyng from work on the
Sabbath day, choice of meats, holy days, dyuersities and dyfferences between
one sort of men and an other, in garments, vows, fastinges, eschewing the
eating of such beasts as dyed by them selves: which things all that gross
people were commanded to keep for a season, yt they might accustom themselves
to obey Gods commandment, until that the true light did appear through
the gospel, and to it shadows should give place. Wherefore such as
understood not the law to be spiritual, affirmed that that which was
commanded and appointed by god, and left to them of their fathers, and
observed or duly kept of their auncestry, so many hundred years ought to
continue for ever. This opinion in them proceeded not of malice but rather of a
supersticious favor to the law, which, whiles they endeavored to keep still,
they clean ouerthrewe. For Paul at the first time being provoked with like
zele, persecuted the christen men. And so when as the rumor and brute of those
things which were done at Antioche (from whence Paul and Barnabas of a common
consent, took their journey toward Cypres, and thence to Pamphilia, and had
openly without respect of any person preached the gospel, both to the Jews,
to the Proselites, and also to the Gentiles, and had not willed them to obscrue
or keep any part of the law) had been spread as far as Jerusalem, certain
came from Iewry to Antioche, teaching a new doctrine disagreeyng from that,
that Paul and Barnabas had taught. For they said to those of the Gentiles
that were turned to the faith: Except ye be circumcised according to the rule
appointed by Moses law, ye can not be saved. This was the beginning of
dyssencion between those that stuck to the litteral sense of the law, and the
other that followed the pure and spyrytuall lybertye of the gospel, which
strife and dyssencion will still evermore continue among christen men also.
And to none other end did god suffer this same strife to arise up, but that
all such as were the disciples of Christ, might the better perceive, how
pernicious a thing relygion is, that is wholly founded upon ceremonies. But when
as Paul and Barnabas, like valiau^t defendoures of the liberty of the gospel,
had ernestly resisted their doctrine, which outwardly seemed to be godly, but
in very deed was very full of myschiefe, there arose a great variaunce, whiles
that the apostles strongly defended the purity of the doctrine of the
gospel, which is spiritual, by testimonies of the prophets, against those
that supersticiously defended the law, and they on the other side being
affeccionate to the law that they had received of their forefathers, went about
to bring the Gentiles, under the same yoke, not perceiuyng in the mean season
what slaund^^ and reproach it was to Christ, whose grace they thought lacked
assistence of the law. For it was lawful for him, that made the law, to
abrogate and abolyshe the same. Howbeit he does not abrogate the law that
perfourmeth it. They determined that Paul and Barnabas, etc.
This sedicion was more hurtful to the gospel, than the cruelty of Herod,
or any other prince, because it strove against the true relygion, under a false
and cloked pretense of godlynes. Wherefore lest that this myscheuous dyscorde
should increase, it was thought expedient by the congregation of the
disciples, that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of the same sort,
should take their journey to Jerusalem to Peter and the other apostles nnd
priests, which did than rule the church of Jerusalem, that this question,
or controversy that was arisen, might be decysed by their cunning and
knowledge. For hitherto the chief authority remained there, where the doctrine
of the gospel first sprung up, and the same authority remained among them,
that first were sent abroad by Jesus Christ to preach.

Than Paul and Barnabas took their journey, and a great multitude of disciples
honorably brought them on their way, and as they passed by Phenice and
Samaria, they showed in every place how the Gentiles were converted to the
faith: so sure were these apostles that they had preached well, that they
feared not openly, and of their own accord to rehearse the same: neither
went they to Jerusalem to learn of the apostles, whether they had dooen well
before time or not, but that the troublous commocion, and disquieting of the
weaker sort, might be laid down and appeaced by the authority of the
elders. And as many as were converted to the faith in those parts, did not
only not reyse sedicion as the Jews had done, but rejoiced also wondrefully.

But when Paul and Barnabas and their other companions were come to
Jerusalem, they were ientely received of the congregation which was there,
and likewise of the apostles, and seniours, unto whom being assembled
together, they showed all things, that God had wroughte by them among the
Gentiles.

And whereas the more part of the multitude approved their doings, there arose
certain of the Phariseis sect, that had been converted to the faith: which
were in this opinion, Then arose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees.
that they thought that man could not obtain salvation by grace and favor
through the gospel, unless he kept the law. And therefore earnestlye
resoned that no Gentiles ought to be made partakers of the gospel, unless
they would before take upon them the yoke of Moses law, which thing the
Gentyles excedyngly abhorred. But the Pharis^is would be seen more earnest
folowers of the law than others were. And therefore they, as doctors of the
law, affirmed that those Gentyles, that were received to the faith, ought to
be circumcised and that a straight commandment ought to be given unto them
that they should keep Moses law, not understanding ye none brake the law more
then (...) as sticked so much to the letter, and not to the meaning of the
law. And what in this matter eftsoon dissencion was moved (see how perilous
a thing and how easy to set men together by the ears supersticion is) the
Apostles and elders assembled together, to thentent that they might consulte
and deuyse what was best to be done in this matier. For they being much
desirous of their masters auauncement, and to win more unto him, feared les^e
that many of the Gentyles minds would be alienated and turned away from
Christ, because they could not abide the law. And again, they thought it
not expedient to give a just cause to the Jews to forsake the gospel, as
though it were dysagreeyng from the holy law, forasmuch as they were so
earnestlye rooted in the law, which they had received of their forefathers,
and had at that time in great reverence, that they might not suddenly be
plucked from it.

Wherefore both parties being in earnest disputacion, and reasonyng, and both
parties allegyng testimonies out of scriptures, and groundyng their arguments
upon the same, Peter arose up and spoke unto them, in this wise. Brethren,
wherefore call ye this matter into controversy, or disputacion as though it
were doubtful, and as who says, that it were in man's arbitrament to allow
or dysailowe that thing, that god has already allowed. Your selves do know
that few years since it chanced me to have the practyse of such a like
thing in Iewry, as ye find fault withal among all the Gentiles now. For when
ye likewise grutched that Cornelius and his householde were Christened, I
showed unto you all the whole matier, how that I took my journey to Cesarea,
not of mine own head, but by the commandment of God, to preach his
ghospel to the Gentiles also, that they through faith in him, might obtain
salvation. And where as they, that heard me than preach the gospel, were
uncircumcised, and free without bondage of Moses law, yet nevertheless god,
(who estemeth not man of his apparel, or outward furniture, but of the inward
affeccion of his heart, which he alone does know:) gave us manifest tokens
that he approved their faith, forasmuch as he, whiles they harkened unto us,
powered on them his holy ghost, yea so plentifully, that they spoke diverse
languages, as well as we, and that also before they were christened, so that he
put no dyfference, as concerning the gracious favor that cummeth by the
gospel, between them which were not circumcised, and us that are Jews.

For their hertes be cleansed through faith, plainly declaring to us that this
favor does not consist in the power of the law to give it unto men, but in
faith, which makes man acceptable in the sight of God. For God gives not his
holy spirit to the unclean. And they had nothing else but eue^ a plain
belief, when the holy ghost came down upon them. Wherefore now seeing that
God has expressed his mind, and will, that the Gentiles should be received
to the gospel, and should be partakers thereof through only faith without
the burden of the law, why than do ye provoke and tempte God, whiles that
contrary to his will, ye go about to lay upon the disciples necks this so
heavy a yoke of the law, which they were never hitherto used unto: and the
which neither our forefathers, But we believe. etc.
nor yet we our selves that were borne under the law, could ever be hable to
bear? For which of us all ever kept the law as it ought to be kept?
Wherefore there remains no hope for us to attain unto salvation by keeping of
the law, but we trust to be saved by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
being in this behalf, nothing better then the Gentiles, unto whom he willed
this gift to be freely communicate, and parted as he freely gave it unto us
also. By these words of Peter the contencious disputacion between the
Pharisees, and those that were of opinion contrary, was ceased. And so
afterward the multitude quietly hard Barnabas and Paul, showing by how
sondrye miracles, and woonders, which had by their hands been wroughte among
the Gentiles, God had witnessed that his will was, that the Gentyles should
be made partakers of the gospel, without kepeynge of the heavy burden of the
law, according as he had declared his mind before to Peter, when he was
preaching Christ in Cornelius house, by sendyng down the holy ghost upon them.

When they had ended their communicacion, James which otherwise was called
James the just, or James the good, and was commonly named the brother of our
lord, to whom the apostles had than committed chief authority, arose, and
approved their sayings, in this wise: Brethren, for as much as ye have quietly
heard the other that spoke unto you, I pray you hear me also, whiles that I
show you my conceit, what I think best to be done in this matter. Simon
Peter declared even now that thing which all we know to be very true, how
that first it pleased god, which had great pity upon mankind, Simon told how
god etc,
seeing in what distress and extremity of peril and danger to be lost the
Gentyles were, and how they were all given to worshyppinge of idols, to chose
him a people even of those also, that seemed to be none of his people, a people
that should be well accepted with him, and call on his name, as well as we. And
that same thing which God begone by Peter, he has enlarged by Paul and
Barnabas. And what we heard was done by them, the same long sense was
prophesied and showed before by the prophets that it should come to pass: And
among the rest of the said prophets, Amos speaks in the person of god, in
this wise: After this will I return, and repair the tabernacle of David, that
is fallen in decay, and I will build up again his ruins, and falls, and
set them eftsons up, that all men which are on live shall seek the lord, and
all gentiles that have taken my name on them (says the lord) that do
accomplish these things. Whatsoever promise god makes he will undoubtedly
perform. For before the creacion of the world, he had appointed, what he
would do from time to time. And whatsoever he has ordained, must needs be
wondrefully well done. Now therefore seeing that we perceive that it is come to
pass, which he promised, I think it not expedyent to resist the will of God
nor to speak ought against them that of heathen, are become wurshyppers of
the true god: neither yet to charge them with the observing of the law,
forasmuch as faith through the gospel, is sufficient for the salvation of all
men. But let them only have this monicion, that for their sakes, which be
weak in faith, and can not yet be persuaded that an Idol is of no pryse,
and that there is no dyfference beetwene the fleashe that is sacrificed to
Idolles, and any other fleashe that is sold in the market: and because of
such persons likewise as think whordome to be none offense, forasmuch as it
is commonly used and permitted without any punishment appointed by man's law,
they absteyne from fylthinesse of Idolles: that is to say, that they neither
sacrifice to them, nor eat of that which is sacrificed, and that also they
abstain from whordome.

Again because of certain Jews that be somewhat supersticious, and can not
yet be persuaded, that all things are pure and clean unto them that be pure
and clean their selves, let them abstain from strangled beasts, and from
blood, not because these things pertain any whit to the health of the
soul, but because that charity so provoke us to do, that for a time we
bear with certain of our brethren, which be weak, until such time that
they may attain to more perfeccion, and in the mean time let every manne
bear one with an other, and so nouryshe concord between you, doing each for
other as loving brethren.

Neither need the Jews to fear lest Moses should be abrogate, or decay,
for he has certain, and has had this many years, that speak of him in the
Synagoges, where he customably is read every sabbath day.

When James had this said, and every man had allowed his sayings thapostles
and seniours, and the whole congregation, thought it expediente, that certain
should be chosen out of that noumbre, to go with Paul and Barnabas to
Antioche. And so they chose a couple that were known to be men of good credit,
the one was Judas, which for his godly behauioure was otherwise called by
syrname the Just, and Silas, which both were accoumpted to be of most
upright living among all the other brethren. To these they gave certain messages
to do, and delivered them an epistle to carye, the tenor whereof was this.

The Apostles and elders with the other brethren also, which of Jews are
becum christen men, send gretyng unto those of the Gentiles, which are
converted to Christ, and are now abydyng in Antioche, Siria and Cilicia.
Forasmuch as we understand, that certain of the Jews which came from hence,
as though they had been sent of us, have troubled you, whereas before their
cummyng, ye were quiet, and continued in vuitie together, living after the
trade of gospel, and forasmuch as the said persons so cummynge to you,
have perverted your minds with their new doctrine, in that they wylled you to
be circumcised and to keep the law, where as we gave them no such thing in
commission: we have now thought good and expedient by the assemblye of the
whole conuocacion, that certain amongst us purposely chosen, should be sent
unto you, with Paul and Barnabas, whom we, not without good cause, do
favor and greatly tender, forasmuch as they have auentured their lives for
the setting furthe of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Wherefore we have
sent Judas and Silas, men who^ we know to be very godly and faithful, by
whose report, ye may certaynlye have knowledge of those things that we
write. The whole sum whereof is this that follows: It has pleased the holy
ghost, and through his mocion us all with one consent, not to burden you with
any more, then with these things which we thought very nessarye to be
observed, that is to say, first that ye absteyne from that that is
sacrificed to Idolles, lest that if ye should eat of it, ye might seem to
favor the same supersticion, which ye have once renounced and forsaken.
Secondly that ye eat no beasts blood, or any beast that is strangled, which
are unlawful meats and forbidden by the law. Finally, that ye absteyne from
whoredom, which the Gentiles supposed to be lawful. If ye absteyne from
these things, ye shall do well. And thus fare ye well.

of the brethren unto the Apostles. Notwithstanding it pleased Sylas, to abide
there (...), but Judas departed alone to Jerusalem: Paul and Barnabas
continued in Antioche, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord with other
many. After this done, they were dismissed with the letters and message: and
when they came to Antioche, they delivered the letters to the congregation.
Which, when they were in audience of them al rehearsed, the whole multitude
reioysed with great comfort, because the Apostles and elders, and commons of
Jerusalem, had vouchesafed by their authority to stay them in that opinion,
which they had already conceived in their minds. And than Judas and Sylas
having the gift of expoundyng scriptures, satisfied every man in those
things that were not namelye expressed in the letters, according to the
commission of the Apostles. And as large they exhorted the brethren and made
them steadfast in their mind, wyllyng them to continue in that that they had
begone. And when they had tarried there a good sort of days, they were
dimissed of the brethren in peace, and were permitted to return unto them
that had sent them. And forasmuch as Sylas thought it best to tarrye
there, Judas returned alone to Jerusalem. In the mean space Paul also and
Barnabas remained at Antioche, teaching indifferentlye both Jews and also
Gentiles, preaching salvation unto every manne to be obtained, if they would
believe the Gospel, that is to say, the word of God.

And after a good space, Paul became careful for the disciples, that he had
left at Cypres, and in Pamphilia. Than he said unto his cumpanion Barnabas:
Let us go visitte our brethren that be abroad in all cities, whereas we have
preached the word of God, and see how they do. Barnabas allowed his sayings,
But Paul would not take him unto their company. etc.
but his mind was to have John, which otherwise was called Mark, to go with
them, whom they before had brought out with them when they took their journey
thytherwardes. In which matter Paul dissented or disagreed from him, thynkyng
him not mete to be received in part of that business, seeing that he before
time of his own accord, had forsaken them before they had finished that
business, which they had taken in hand, and had sailed back from Pamphilia
to Antioche. And they were so earneste in disputing or reasonyng this matter,
that where as none would give place to other, one departed from the cumpany of
the other. Not because that any grievous displeasure was arysen between so
great apostles, but because that both contended to bring to pass that they
thought expedient for setting forth the Gospel. And we have here example left
us, not straight ways to esteem evil, whatsoever disagreeth with our opinion.
It is no matter to be of a diverse opinion, so that men's minds do agree in
furtheryng the gospel. And god also provided this, that by the dissencion of
the Apostles, when two chief capitaynes were disseuered, the gospel should
sprede more at large, then if they had continued together in one company, as
they had done before. And then Barnabas taking Mark with him sailed into
Cypres which was his native countreye. And so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed
to Cipres.


And Paul taking to him Sylas, (which, as god would, had remained at
Antioche, even as it had been for the nones and of a purpose, that Paul
should not be destitute of a sad man to bear him cumpanye, and a man that
^as in good estimacion, being dimissed of the brethren, and committed to the
grace of god,) took his journey whither ever he had any token of hope, that ye
gospel should have increase. So he went over to Syria, and Cilicia, whereas he
himself was borne, and echewhere stablyshinge the cumpanyes of such
disciples, as he before had gotten there, and encreasyng also the number of
them, as his purpose before was, commanded them to keep those things that the
apostles, and elders had decreed at Jerusalem, as concerning eschewinge the
cu^pany of such as were wurshyppers of Idolles, and eschewyng whoredom,
strangled beasts, and blood, and that they were none otherwise bound to keep
Moses law. When all these things were done in Cilicia he returned again to
Derba, and after to Listres.

The.xvi. Chapter.

ANd behold there was a certain disciple, whose name agreed with his deeds,
and was called Timothy, as a man would say, in estimacion with God, who was
borne of Parents, that were of sundry sects. For his mother being now a
widow, was a Jew borne, and had of late been converted from the faith and
perverse belief of the Jews, unto the true faith of Christ. And his father
was a gentile. This Timothy for his virtuous disposicion, Of whom reported
well, the brethren that were at Listra and Iconium.
and living, was much spoken of among all the brethren that were at Listres,
and also at Iconium. And so Paul desiring nothing more than by all means
daily to enlarge the bounds of the gospel, searched out in every corner,
such as might serve his turn, even as ambicious kings are accustomed to do,
which being wholly given to enlarge their dominions, care for nothing more,
then to get mete capitaynes, and rulers, to whom they may commit their
affairs. But it is not sufficient for him that is captain, or guyed in
matters of the gospel, to have mean qualities, nor yet to be of an upright
behauioure, but he must have commendacion of all good men, lest that an evil
name going on him, though it be false, may hurt the furthering of the gospel.
Wherefore Paul was desirous to have Timothy to bear him cumpany in his
iournies, because he was good, and esteemed also of all good men, to be good
and virtuous. And when he had obtained him, to join with him, he circumcised
him, not because he thought he might thereby obtain salvation, which only
faith could do, but le^te the Jews should make any commocion, of whom
there was no small noumber in those parts, he vouchesafed rather to suffer
Timothy to lose a little piece of skin. (which if he had still kept, For
they all knew yt his father was a Greek.
he had not been the better, nor yet the worse for lack of it) then by
occasion thereof, to turn away the Jews minds from the gospel, whose
stubbrenesse he knew well enough. The Gentiles were free from the burden of
the law, by the decree that the apostles had made at Jerusalem Paul being
present: And circumcision was a profession made to observe the law, and as a
token thereof. But the Jews were not yet openly delivered from the yoke of the
law, which ought by little and little to be abolisshed. Wherefore seeing that it
was evident by all tokens, that Timotheus mother was a Jew borne, and his
father a paynym, by occasion whereof he had not been hitherto circumcised,
Paul tyghte well perceived that the Jews would make sedicion if they might
have never so little a cause, and specially if Timothy, which was half a
Jew borne, were not only made pertaker of the gospel without circumcision,
but also called to the office of a preacher. Wherefore Paul in those days did
bear so much with them, having ever respect only to further the gospel,
and to keep men in quietness, which had professed Christ the author of all
true peace.

And not only thus did he, but whatsoever cities they were that he went by, he
commanded those that of heathen were becum christen, to keep those things that
had been decreed by the apostles, and elders at Jerusalem: for the which
purpose Judas, and Sylas, had been sent before to Antioche, lest the Jews
should find any fault therewith. And god furthered Paul in all his business.
For ye congregacions of the disciples were both establyshed in the faith of the
gospel, and daily also augme^ted, many persons being day by day converted to
the faith.

And when they had trauayled over Phrygia, and Galacia, with great profit in
wynnyng many to the faith, although they were but a gross, and a rude people,
and were much desirous to take their iourneye toward that part which is
properly called Asia, the holy ghost would not suffer them to preach the
gospel there. And this the secret and privy will of God, obeyed they,
forasmuch as it is not sittyng that manne should withstand god. And so
chaungeyng their intent, they turned to Mysia fast borderyng upon that
cou^treye, which is properly called Asia. Thence they attempted to take their
journey toward Bithinia, turnyng them northwarde. For that was a noble
province of the Romans, and therefore they hoped there to have great
auau^tage. But the spirit of Jesus which was their guide, would not permit
them to go thither, the cause why is uncertain. Wherefore returnyng back
toward the weste, when they had goen over Mysia, they came to Troas. That same
is a city of Phrigia, ioynyng nere unto the sea, and otherwise called
Antigonia.

And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia
and prayed him saying: cum into Macedonia, and help us. After he had seen this
vision, immediately we prepared to go into Macedonia, being certifyed that ye
lord had called us, to preach the gospel unto them. When we loosed forth then
from Troada, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to
Naples, and from thence to Philippos, which is ye chief city in the parts of
Macedonia, and a free city. We were in that city abydyng certain days. And
on ye Sabbath days we went out of ye city besides a river where men were wont
to pray. And we sat down, and spoke unto the women which resorted thither.
There had Paul a vision in his sleep, which showed him whither he should go:
The vision was this. There stood by him a certain man appareled like a man of
Macedonia, which entreated him, and said: Cum to Macedonia, and help us. And
he that so appeared, was the Angel that is defendout of that countreye. And as
soon as Paul had seen that vision* which had once or twyse before been
forbidden by ye holy ghost to preach the gospel, we that were his cumpanions,
were very glad of it. For I also that wrote this, was in that iourneye, and by
and by we provided al things to take our journey to Macedonia, being assured
that God had called us thither to preach the gospel unto them, the which we
doubted not, but God would prospet them well. And in this wise leauyng Troas,
and ^aylyng by Chersonesus, we arrived at Samothrace the Yland, which is
situate directly against Chracia. And from thence the next day we came to
Naples, which is a city on the sea side in the marches of Thracia, and
Macedonia. And from thence to the city Philippos, which is a free city, and
the first that ye come unto, when ye go from Naples. In this city abode we
certain days, lookynge for a good time and occasion to begin the matter,
wherefore we came. And on the sabbath day we walked forth of the city, into a
certain place without ye gates that was nere to a river, where as a great
multitude of the people together, did customably resort and assemble for to
make their prayers. And as we were there syttyng, our talk was unto certain
women that were come thither, and we were preaching unto them Jesus of Nazareth.

Emonge them was one which was veraye devout, whose name was Lidia, a seller
of purple, and one that was borne in the city Thyatira, which is a city in
Lidia. And among all other that hearkened unto Paul's preaching of Christ,
god opened her heart diligently to hear those things that Paul taught. And
so after that she was Christened with all her household, she desired Paul, and
his companions, saying: If ye have thought me one not unworthy to be received
by mean of baptism, and your instruction, as a partaker of the ghospel, I
pray you do so much also for me, as to cum into my house, and do it honor with
your presence, and take not me as an Ethnicke, as I was erewhiles, but take me
as I am now, renewed by faith of the gospel through your ministry. By these
words she entreated the Apostles to tarry as gestes at her house a good space.
Here is an example for preachers, that they refuse not ientylnesse proffered
unto them, by those that are newlye converted to Christ, if it be readely and
instauntly proffered, lest they seem not to knowledge them for theyrs. And on
the other side, they ought not to preace on them, until they be desired, lest
they seem to crave rewards for preaching the gospel. But he that has
received a spiritual or ghostely benefyte, ought ernestly to cause those that
have so done for him, to receive at his hands again corporal benefytes, if
they shall have need thereof.

And it chanced, as we were going to pray, as our custom was, that a certain
damsel met us, which had in her the spirit of the devil Pithon, which by
propheciyng and tellyng things before hand, got great advantage to her
master and maystresse. She ouertakyng and following Paul and us, cried saying:
These me^ne are the servants of the high god, which are cum to teach you
the way^ of salvation. And where as she continued thus dooyng many days, Paul
being dyscontented, lest that he should seem to knowledge that praise which
the wenche being possessed with a dyuell, attributed unto him, turned to her,
and said to the spirit: I command the in the name of Jesus Christ that thou
depart out of her. And the spirit left her immediately.

But the damsels master and maystres, seeing that their bau^tage was goen, took
Paul and Silas, and brought them violently into the market place before the
chief of the city, and there before the officers, accused them, saying:
These men which are cum hither from sum strange country, do trouble all the
whole city: forasmuch as they being Jews borne, teach us a new relygion,
and teach us new ordinances, which is not lawful for us to receive, seeing
that we live according to the laws of the Romans, which will not permit
ne suffer us, neither to receive any strange gods, nor to practyse any new
kinds of wurshyppyng the gods. Upon these complayntes, the people there
among whom the very name of a Jew was in great hatred, clustryng all in a
cage together, made assault upon the Apostles. And the officers, to satysfye
the people in their furye, cut a sondre their garments for wrath, and
commanded them to be beaten with rods. And being not satysfyed with this
punishment, wha^ they had laid many a sore stripe on them they cast them in
prison, commaundyng the iaylour to keep them dyligently. The iaylour when they
had so streyghtly charged him, for the better safegarde, laid them beneathe
in a lower prison: and yet was not contented, but set them fast in the
stocks. This luck had they at their first entryng to preach in Macedonie.
Mark here that evermore either lucre, or ambicion, or else supersticion,
lets the furtheraunce of the gospel. But when the world most cruelly
rages in persecucion of Christ's members, than especially appears comfort
from heaven.

About mydnyght Paul and Sylas, not passing for their whyppyng, nor yet that
they were cast into prison, prayed and song hymns in the laud and praise of
God, thankyng him, that he had vouchesaued to do them being his servants,
such honor, as to let them suffer these injuries for his name. And other,
which were prisoners there, heard them meryly singing the praise of God, All the dore^ opened and every man^ bands were losed.
and of his son Jesus Christ, and meruayled, that they in such adversity
could be so merye. And sodaynely came a great yearthequake, insomuche that
all the whole prison was shaken even the foundacyon and all, and all the doors
of the prison were open with the same, and all the prisoners gyues and other
like bonds were loosed. The keeper, at the great noise and tumblyng that was
made, awaked: and when he had starte forth, and found all the prison doors
wide open, thynkyng upon and verily imagynyng that the prisoners were all gone,
and having in remembrance the charge that he had of the officers, pulled out
his swearde and was about to kill himself, wyllyng rather to slaye himself,
then first to suffer many paynefull torments, and afterward at the
hangmannes hand, which was execucioner of the town, to suffer death. But
Paul which lay beneth in the dark, seeing him about such a deed, cried out
with a loud voice, that although the man were astonished, yet he made him
hearken unto him, and said: Beware, hold thy hands, and hurt not thy self,
for thou shalt have no damage by us. For we are all here, and not one of us
fled hence.

When the keeper heard these words, he came to himself again, and commanded
light to be brought: and seeing it to be so, and that the thing was not done
by any craft of man* but by sum divine power: consyderyng also with himself,
how that Paul had seen in the dark what he was about to do, and the cause
thereof, went down into the lower prison, and fell at Paul's and Sylas feet.
And regarding not the charge yt was given him by the officers, brought them
forth of prison, into a more commodiouse place, and said: Masters what must I
do to be saved? His mind was to exchange health for health. His intent was to
save their lives and likewise he minded to hear of them how he should
obtain life of his soul. Than they answered: Believe in our lord Jesus, and
thou shall be saved with all thy householde. And there streyghtewayes he called
them all together, and the apostles preached unto them the doctrine of the
gospel. Thou may here see that no time, ne place is unmeet to preach or
to hear the ghospel. For that same dark and stynkyng prison was as a church
to the apostles. They ceased not from syngyng hymns though it were mydnyght.
By preaching the gospel in prison a vauntage was gotten to Christ. The prison
is here as a chair to preach the gospel in. And furthwith the keeper being
newly enstructed in the faith, hastened to recompense or sumwhat to reward his
enstructour. For he anon had them aside, and washed clean their wounds. The
iaylour thought this to be his duty. And he himself afterward with all his
whole householde, had the wounds of their souls washed clean away. After
this so done, he led the^ into his own house where he dwelled the day time,
and gave them meat to refreshe their bodies.

For after baptism next was the communion of the table. And the keeper of the
prison reioysed much, that it had been his chance to have* in custodye such
prisoners, whereby both he and all the house had received the faith. These
things were done in the night.

When it was day the officers more diligently having the matter in
communicacion, after they had weyed it well, sent the ministers to the keeper,
commaundyng him to let Paul and Sylas depart at their own lybertye. The
keeper hearing this tidinges, being glad as well for his own part, as for the
apostles sakes, brought this word to Paul, that the officers had lycenced
them to go at liberty. Wherefore, (says the keeper,) seeing it has so well
chanced, go ye in gods blessyng. But Paul of an earneste mind, to make
both his innocence the better known, and to find occasion also to save many,
made answer unto the messengers in this wise: Nay verily but let them come
themselves and see us out.
Forasmuch as they boaste themselves to be Cytezens of Rome, by their laws it
is forbidden to punish any man, before he be heard to plead his cause, and
lawfully convicted of the same, this notwithstanding they have openly beaten
us being Romans before we pleaded our matter, or were lawfully convicted:
and as though this had been to little, they cast us also, after that we had
been sore beaten, into prison. Now for their own sauegarde, that they may
seem to have done nothing, but that their office would bear them in, and that
it may be thought that we were gilty, they would have us privily to co^uey
our selves hence to yt intent, that men might suppose that we brake prison and
fled away. No, we will not so do, but let them cum themselves, and deliver us
hence by the same right, that they cast us in. The ministers told to the
officers, what Paul had said.

Who hearing that they were citizens of Rome, came themselves to Paul, and
Silas, and desired them to pardone them, in that they had done against the
custom of the Romayne laws, being compelled by the commocion of the people,
and bryngyng them honorably out of the kepers house, they desired them, lest
the people should make any business, to depart from their city named
Philippos.

The Apostles were content to accomplish their request, and when they were
out of prison, they went into the house of Lydia, where they had been first
hosted, which Lydia with all her whole householde, had before received the
doctrine of the gospel. And when they had seen her, and the rest of ye
brethren, they comforted them, rehearsyng unto them what had chanced in the
night whiles they were in prison, exhorting them to continue in that they had
begone. This done, they left Philippos the city, and went another way.

The.xvii. Chapter.

ANd passing by Amphipolis and Apollonia, both Cities of Macedonie, they came
to Thessalonica, which is the chief and head City in Macedonie. Where
(because it was a noble city) was a Synagoge of Jews, and therefore hoped they
to have there great increase. Wherefore Paul (as he customably used to do)
entered with the multitude in to the Sinagoge, and three sabbath days reasoned
he with them, allegyng for his part, Prophecies out of the scriptures, and
expoundyng the hard meanynges of figures, cityng testimonies out of the law,
and conferryng these sayings together with the acts that were past, he showed
how that it was the will of God, that Christ should in that wise suffer for
the world, and arise again from death to life. And forasmuch as all
Prophecies that were spoken before of Messiah coming, and all those things
that were shadowed under figures, did agree in Jesus of Nazareth, he affyrmeth
in his teachinges that the Jews should look for none other Messiah, but only
the same that he preached unto them, which was Christ. When Paul had reasoned
this matter in the Sinagoge, certain of the Jews believed and joined
themselves with Paul and Silas, and besides these, a great number of the
Gentyles that feared God, were converted to the faith, and among other, diverse
wurshipfull women of the chief of that city.

another king, one Jesus. And they troubled the people, and the officers of the
city, when they heard these things. And when they were sufficiently answered
of Jason, and of the others, they let them go. On the other part, certain
Jews being ouermuche wedded to Moses law, which Paul sometime had
earnestly favored, being of a zele moved, and ioynyng themselves with a
certain number of naughty vagaboundes, whom they had made of their part (for
of such fellows have they that be authors of any commocion, need of) and
gatheryng to them a great company besides, raised up the city. And
sediciously coming to the house of Jason, would have brought Paul and Sylas
forth before the people. But forasmuch as they entryng in to the house, found
not them that they sought for, they brought Jason himself, and with him
certain other discyples, before the governors of the city, criyng alowde
(for so had they before time served Christ) and said: These fellows that
already have troubled all the world, are now cumme hither likewise to
trouble us. And Jason knowing them to be such fellows, received them into his
house.

But all those that go about any such matters, or lodge such as go about the
same, do against Cesars acts, forasmuch as they say, that there is an
other king, besides Caesar* For they preach of one Jesus, that was a good
whiles since, done and nailed upon the cross by Cesars deputy, because he
affyrmed himself to be king of the Jews. Mark how they here abuse the name
and authority of Caesar, against the gospel. When the people and rewlers of
the city heard these words, they were much moved therwyth, even as Pylate
before in like manier was moved against Christ.

For than cried the unhappy Jews: we have none other king besides Caesar: and
again: And when they were sufficyently answered of Jason. etc.
If thou let him go, thou art not Cesars friend: and yet again: Whosoever
makes himself a king, withstandeth Caesar. On the other part, the true Jews
thus do cry: We have none other king but only Jesus of Nazareth: and again,
whosoever conformeth himself to follow Caesar, is not Christ's friend. For he
only is king over all the world. But after that Jason and the other brethren
had alleged a lawful excuse, the officers let them go.

But when the brethren perceived that through displeasure and malice Paul and
Silas were like to be in daungier, they with speed, conuaied them out pryuely
in the night season to Berea* which is a city in Macedonia, not far from
Pella, whereas Alexander the great was borne. In this wise, the evangelical
captains fly, but so that they nevertheless fight still. For as soon as
they came to Berea, they entered into the Synagoge, nothing afraid for all so
many sedicions that the Jews had raised against them. But these were more
gentle, than the others that were at Thessalonica. For they received the
doctrine of the gospel very readely, every day searchyng the scriptures
diligently, When the Jews of Thessalonia had knoweledge, that the word of
god was preached of Paul at Berea.
that they might see how those things that they had learned by thapostles
instruction, agreed with the Prophecies, and figures of the law. And so were
many of the Citizens of Berea, converted to the faith, not Jews only, but
also diverse wourshipfull women that were Greeks borne, and a great noumber of
men besides. But when the Jews that were at Thessalonica, which had made a
commocyon there, heard that the ghospel was preached at Berea by Paul, whom
they had driven from them, they took their iourneye thither, and as they
before had done, so eftsoon they stirred up the multitude there also against
the Apostles.

And what time the brethren perceived that daungier was if the Apostles had
tarried, they immediately sent forth Paul, whom they thought to be most in
danger, to goo and take the sea, which is not far from Berea. And Silas and
Timothy remained at Berea. Than the brethren that had brought Paul thither,
taking shypping with him, brought him as far as Athens. There they left
Paul, and returned to Berea, having message from him to Silas and Timothy, yt
they should follow after as soon as they might conveniently.

There Paul though he were left alone and without companions, yet seeing so
noble a city as that was and so full of learned men, wholly and utterly given
to worshipping of idols, waxed hot in spirit, in so much that he could not
abide the cummyng of his fellows, but entered into the sinagoge, and there
disputed with the Jews, and other devout persons. And besides that also, he
reasoned in the market place with all that came unto him, whether they were
Jews, or else Greeks. Among whom were some Philosophers, of Epicures sect,
some Stoickes, between who^ was great diversity of opinions. For they that
were of Epicures sect mesuring the felicity of man by pleasure, think that
either there be no gods, or if there be any, that they nothing regard the life
of man. The Stoickes besides other straung opinions, do set and esteem the
felicity of man by the steadfast qualities of the soul, which felicity they
call virtue or honesty. These men disputed with Paul, as he had been a
Philosopher that were a begynner of some new sect.

But after that Paul had taught them the euangelycal Philosophy, which far
dysagreed from the Philosophers opinyons, some said in mockage: What is it
that this pratelyng fellow says? For by this reprochefull word spermologus,
the Greeks meaned a iangler, and a foolyshe talker of vain words, and a
pratler: for the heavenly wisdom seemed unto them foolyshenesse. He seems to
be a tydinges bringer of new deuilles.
And others there were that said: He seems to bring in some new kind of
gods, because that he preached unto them that Jesus was the true savior, and
the son of God, and that the dead in time to cum should arise again. For
they of Athens, according as they had been instructed of Plato, called the gods
children, gods, whom they supposed to have bodies which should continue for
ever. Wherefore, inasmuche as whiles they were in the market place, they had
diverse opinions of Paul, they thought it best to lead him aside in to a
street, which is called Mars street. The street is a place in Athens of much
resort of people, by reason that there they did sit on matters of life and
death in the night season. And that place was meet for that kind of
disputacion, which proffered salvation to them that believed therein, and death
to the unfaithful. For they said: May a man learn of the what new kind
of doctrine this is, that thou speak of? For where as all kinds of
Philosophye are treated of amongeste us, yet thou show us news, and such as
we never heard of yet: we are therefore desirous to hear the more at large,
to what end these things may grow, that thou speakeste of, or what they
mean. And for as much as that city was namely among all the cities of Greece,
most exercised in all kinds of learning, and given to eloquence, by occasion
whereof, many resorted thither out of all parts of the world, to be students
there, both the citizens of Athens, and other straungiers that were continuing
there, did nothing else, but either harken for news, or else tell some news:
and that more for their pleasure, then that they desired by knowledge of
matiers, to be the better expert. But god that is desirouse of man's health,
as fyshers and hunters do invent all means to get their pray, so takes
every man by occasyon of those things, that he is most delyted with all.

Wherefore Paul that knew how to behave himself emonge all sorts of men,
and to frame his eloquence to all men's capacities, now being in the mids
of Mars street, as it were in a stage to play his part alone, having about
him a great multitude, spoke unto them in this wise: Ye men of Athens, although
this city flourysheth more the^ any other in learning and knowledge, yet I
perceive that ye, as concerning your trade in relygion, are veraye
supersticious, where as true religion in deed, is the chief part of
Phylosophye. For as I walked about, desirous to know the customs and order of
your city, markyng those things yt ye have in honor and do wurshyp, among
all other things, I espied a certain alter, which in the title that was
graued on it, made mention of an unknown God. Wherefore they are deceived,
that say that I bring in new and strange gods, Whom (...) than ignorau^tly
wurship, him show I unto you.
but I rather preach him unto you, yea even the very same unknown God whom
ye wurshyp, for it appeared by the title on the altar, that ye know not what
he is, so that you may heareafter reverently worship him, when ye know him,
whom ye have hitherto as unknown, worshypped with supersticion. Which God
forasmuch as he is an infinite mind, most pure, present every where, and yet
after that sort, that he is contained in no one certain place, ought not to
be believed to dwell in temples of man's handyworke, or in images made by any
craft of man: God yt made the worl^e and all that are in it. etc.
neither is he dewly wurshipped with the sacrifice of beasts, as though that
either he lacked, or else were delited with any thing that is done by man's
hands, and cummeth of his own brain. For where as he is infinite in
himself, and able to do all things that shall please him being also most
blessed, and that naturally, so that he can neither be hurted by any malice of man, nor yet be helped by any service that manne can do, yet for somuche as
he is pryncipally best, and most bountiful and beneficial, he created and
made this world maruaylously for man's cause: and ordained for his use, all
things that are contained in the same.

Wherefore although that he be the founder, lord, and gouernoure as well of
heaven and yearthe, as of all things in them contained, yet of all these
things, takes he himself no fruicion, for because that he by reason of his
eternal felicity, and bliss, has no need of any external or outward
goodness to the augmentacion of his perfectness, but this world has he left
us, as his work to muse and maruayle at, that mortal men living therein,
might perceive by so wonderful a work, the power, wisdom, and goodness,
of the maker of it, and having thereby once knowledge of him, should love him,
and with great reverence wurshyp him, by whose benefit they have the fruicion
of so many commodities.

Now if he be above this frame of the world, and has need of none of those
things that he has made, how much less may it be thought that he is
delyted with temples, with Images, or else with the sauoure of burned
offerynges. But for as much as he is a substance without body, he ought to be
wurshipped with purity of ye mind: neither looks he for the slaughter of oxen
or sheep, that endoweth all things with life, and gives to all that breathe,
both their life and their breath. Seeing he himself gives life and breath to
al^ men every where. etc.
For he made all kinds of beasts, and they live al by him continuyng and
multyplying every one their own kind from time to time by generation. But all
mankind made he of one man, to have the rewle over all these beasts, and to
dwell in all parts of the world, and has lymitted and appoincted every man
a determinate space to live, which no man can for himself prolong: and has
likewise appoyncted every nation, certain parts of the yearthe to inhabit,
for they are deceived, that suppose the world, which god himself made, not to
be rewled by him, but that each thing is at all adventures, and without any
consideracyon, unadvisedly brought forth, and for no purpose, where as in deed
there is nothing done in the world, be it great or small, but it cummeth by
the providence of him that created the world.

And because that the wit of man cannot conceive him as he naturally is in
deed, by reason of grossenes of the body, he endowed men with reason, that by
one thing they may understand an other, that is to say, things that cannot
be seen by those that are seen, and general things by the particular,
eternal by those that last but for a time: and such things as by the mind,
reason, and spirit, only may be ymagined, by those that be open to the
senses of the body, and set him in the mids of all things, as in a stage to
search out the creatore and maker of all things by mean of his creatures
which may either be seen, felt, or otherwise perceived, by such
commodities as do ensue to manne thereof: and that like as blind men by
feling, sumtyme find that out, which they can not see, so they consyderyng
how wonderfully all things were made, might cumme to sum knowledge of god,
whom to have true knowledge of, is the highest felycitie that manne can have.
And yet we shall not need to seek for god in foreyne things, for we may find
him in our selves, if every manne will look on himself, and mark in himself
the mighty wisdom, and goodness of his maker. For where as god has showed
unto us certain tokens of his godhed, in the heavenly balls and circles
above, and on the yearthe beneth in the sea, and in all living creatures on the
yearthe, yet has he wrought in none of them more wonderfully, than in manne.

But if any man be of such gross wit and capacity, that he cannot attain to
the knowledge of the mouyng of the stars, in the sky above, or of the ebbyng
and flowyng of the sea, how water should first spryng, how ryuers should
still evermore continue runnyng, and briefly the privy and secret causes of
other like things, For in him we live and we move. etc
he need not look far, for he may see god in every man. For by him all we do
live, we move, and we have our being, and there is none other that we are
dettours unto for that we be any thing at all, but only he, that created this
world of nothing: and his benefyte it is, and none others, that we have life,
For we are also his generation.
which we must sone forgo and leave, if he leave us: and we ought to thank
none other, that the members and parts of this lively body does each of them
his duty, the iyes see, the legs go, and the hands work. It is evident
than that god is in every one of us, that he woorketh in us, as a work man
would by a tool, that he himself has made. And man expresses god, not
only as the work expresses the woorkeman, but as the child does resemble
his father or mother, by a certain likeness and symylytude of favor or
complexyon. For so does the holy scriptures teach us, that God made Adam
(which was the first manne, of whom all men came) a body of moist cley,
wherein he should be like unto other beasts, but with his own mouth
breathed he into the same yearthen Image, part of his heavenly breathe,
whereby we might more nere resemble god our father. And for because the natures
be sumwhat like, we should more easyly attain unto the knowledge of him:
which property he gave to none other creatures on yearthe living. Think not
ye this thing unlike to a thing of truth, for some of your own country
men that were poets have affirmed the same, that I alleged out of the
scriptures, and emonge other, Aratus says the same in his work called
Phenomena, in half a verse, in this wise: We all cumme of his lynage. It is no
matter though he speak this of Jupiter, for in that, that he called Jupiter
the chief and highest god, he thought him withal to be the father of all
living things, but especially of men,

Wherefore seeing that we are of the lynage of God, by symylytude of our mind,
which he has given us, we have an evil opinion of our father, if that where
as we be accounted men for that part in us, which we cannot see, (the
which is reason,) we will think him to be like an Image of gold, silver,
wood or stone graven by wit of man. For what is a greater inconvenience,
or more against reason, then that manne, (who though he be somewhat kynne to
God his heavenly father, yet for all that is nothing less then God,) should
be hable to make any Image with his hands, that can have in it the power and
virtue of God? Reason would that the same thing which is wurshypped as God,
should be more excellent, then he that gives wurshyppe unto it. Now how
diverse ways does man pass an Image, which he does wurshyppe as it were
god? First of al this shape of his body, man has received of God, besides and
furthermore does he breath, he lives, he moves, and works. Finally by
agilitie and quickness of the mind, he bears in him a certain resemblau^ce
of god the father. But in an Image there is no such mattier. Wherefore if it
be to gods great dishonor if we wurshyp a mortal manne for god, how
much more than does it disagre with the true honor of God to wurshyppe an
Image made of timber, as it plased ye artificer to make him: of which timber,
if he had been so disposed, he might have made a benche, or a form to sit on,
which thing is not only nothing like god, (who has no body) but also,
besides the outward shape of the body, has nothing like a man, no, not one
jot of that part, whereby manne is like unto god.

Which reprochefull injury though it be heinous before God, yet he of his
great favor and love that he bears to man, has not revenged himself, but
hitherto has wynked at man's ignorance, until the time was cumme that he had
determined to open himself to all men, and to cast clean away all dark and
blind errors, which men have so long been conuersaunt in. Which time is
now present, wherein he monisheth all me^ to leave their old errors, and turn
to him. For his will is that those yt repent, shall have forgiveness, which
they that will be stubberne, shall not in time to cu^, have: for because he has
appointed a day, Because he has appointed a day, in the which he will judge
the world etc.
when he will judge the whole world, and that with a just and straight
judgment, which no man shall escape. And therefore he sends his messangers to
warn men, lest any man might pretend ygnoraunce in these things for his
excuse, and profereth remyssion of sin to them that will repent, lest any
should say that god were not merciful. For both these purposes chose he Jesus
of Nazareth an excellent person, whom he sent into the world for this cause,
that al men by his means, might be converted to wurshyp the true god: and
has given him power to judge the unfaithful, and such that will resyste this
doctrine. And this is he whom he promised by the mouths of his prophets many
years past, that he should cum to be both a saluiour and also a judge. And
look what he promised, he has hitherto performed very certainly. For he was
so borne, so taught, eue^ so troubled with vexacio^, and so slain: and in
conclusion, so arose he from death to life, as it was before prophesied that
he should. And there is no doubt, but that he will as surely perform all
other things that remain behind.

Whiles Paul spoke these words, certain that stood by, gyuyng good ear to
all other things that were spoken, when they had heard mention made of
arysyng from death to life, they mocked at it, as an unlike thing and a thing
that were not to be believed, because that no Philosopher had holden any such
opinion before, though there were sum, which said that the souls remained
on live after the death of the body, and sum other also which said that the
souls entered out of one body into an other. But others that were not of so
rash a judgment, said: We will hear the again an other time of this same
matter. And in this manner Paul dimissed that coumpany. Yet sum there were among
them, that were persuaded, and joined themselves with Paul: among whom was
Dionisius a Senator which afterward was bishop at Athens, instituted by Paul,
and a certain woman whose name was Damatis, and besides these diverse others.

The.xviii. Chapter.

When Paul had gotten thus much gaynes (little and slender though it were) of
encreasyng and auauncyng the ghospel of Christ at Athens, a city of very
corrupt manners, he went thence to Corinthe which is the chiefest mart
town in all Greece: and as it was the welthiest, so was it by reason of riot,
incontinencie, and pride, very vicious. There he by chance met with a man
whose name was Aquila, which observed the Jews religion, but was borne in
Pontus, which Pontus, is a part of the less Asia, bendyng toward the North.
This person, as God would, was cum thither but of late before from Italye, with
his wife Priscilla, forbecause that the Emperor Claudius had commanded al
Jews yt were in Rome, (as there were a great number) to avoid the city. And
because these were of the same craft that Paul was, he lodged in one house
together with them, (for he would not be alone,) labouryng, as they did, with
his hands, lest he should burden any manne. And their craft was to sow
together skynnes to make tents wythall.

And like as Peter was not ashamed to return to his craft of fyshyng, as
often as need compelled him, so the great Apostle Paul, which valiauntlye
had sustained and borne many storms for Christ's sake, was nothing ashamed
to take in hand again sowyng of skynnes, which for to further the Gospel,
he had for a time laid aside. Yet in this mean while ceased not he to preach
the gospel, disputing in the sinagoge every sabbath day both with the Jews and
also with the Gentiles.

When Sylas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by
the spirit, to testify to y^ Jews y^ Jesus was very Christ. And when they
said contrary, and blasphemed, he spoke his ^ayment, and said unto them, your
blood be upon your own heads, from henceforth will I go blameless unto the
Gentiles. And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named
Iustus, a wurshipper of god, whose house joined hard to the Synagoge. Howbeit,
one Cryspus y^ chief ruler of the sinagoge, believed ^n the lord with all his
householde, and mauye of the Corinthians when they gave audyence, believed, and
were baptized. In the mean season Sylas and Timothee, whom Paul willed to
follow him to Athens, came from Macedonie. This dooen, Paul, because he was
much sorry that he had dooen veary little good there, was constrained by the
spirit nevertheless, to preach yet dylygentlye Jesus of Nazareth to the
Jews, af^yrmyng that he was Messiah, whom the Prophets had before
promised, that through him only and none other, man should obtain
salvation. But when they clamoured against him, yea in so much that they were
not afraid blasphemouslye and slanderously to speak against Jesus and
Paul, he having in remembrance what the gospel in that case would him to
do, shook his lap, as who should say, that he cast in their teeth that he
had freely brought unto them the message of salvation, which they ought to
have joyfully received, and said unto them: If you had rather perish then to
be saved, stand ye to your own harm, for as much as ye are the occasion of
your own death. For seeing that I have done my duetye, the fault cannot be
laid to me. Wherefore I will hereafter go to the Gentiles according as the
lord commanded us. And in this wise he, withdrawyng^ himself from the
cumpany of the Jews, entered into the house of a certayn^ man named Titus, and
Iustus by syrname, a man that was well dysposed, who dwelte hard by the
Synagoge. Than Crispus which was chief of the Sinagoge, by reason that he
dwelled nere, believed in the Lord with all his whole householde: and diverse
others of the Corinthians after they had heard Paul, believed, and were
christened.

But when Paul had there neither, not profited so much as his most gredie
desire and dilygente sekyng was, by reason that the Jews did stiffely^ bark
against him, and he had in his mind purposed to leave Corinthus, the Lord
stayed his wauerynge mind, apperyng to him in his sleep in a vision, and
saying: let not the stubbernesse of the Jews fear thee, neither keep thou
close the doctrine of the gospel for their cause: for thou must not more
regard the invincible malice of a few, then the health of many. Wherefore
continue boldly in preaching the gospel, and put thy trust in me, and I shall
reskewe and defend the against them, be they never so many. And n^ man
shall set hands on thee to vex or trouble thee, for I will be thy defendoure.
Wherefore depart not hence, for in this city (though it be vicious) there is
a great number of people which I have already appointed to life everlasting.
When Paul heard this, he leauyng and forsaking his own purpose and
determynacion, which was but of man's devise, and obeyng the counsel of God,
continued at Corinthe a year and an half, constantely and frankly preaching
the gospel.

And whereas one Gallio being proconsull, that is to say the lord deputy
there, did in those days rule the realm of Achaia under Ceasar the Emperor,
within which countreye the said city of Corinthe is situate, the Jews
which had made conspiracy against Paul, and a co^mocion among the people,
drew him before the place of judgment where the lord deputy sat, accusyng
him, and saying: This man contrary to Moses law, counseleth men to wurshyp
God after a new sort, and brings in new trades of religion. Which
complaynte when Paul openyng his mouth was about to make answer unto, Gallio
perceyuyng by the accusacion or enditement that was brought in and declared,
how the controuersye between them concerned the Iewishe religion, did find a
mean to rid his hands of the examinacion thereof: And preuentyng Paul, who
was than in a readiness to speak in defense and declaracion of himself, said
unto the Jews: Masters, I occupy here the room of an officer to minister
justice in causes, by the authority of the Emperor, and to see civil justice
kept, and that nothing be done against the common civil laws of Rome.
Wherefore if wrong were done to any man, or any heinous deed of mischief
committed, that ought to be punyshed by the laws, ye might justly compel me,
yea and it were my duty, to hear you. For the serchyng out of such matiers
appertains unto me. But if it be no such matier, but some special or
private contencion, that is growe^ among your selves, Than all the Greeks took
Sosthenes y^ chief ruler of the synagoge.
about names of sects, or co^municacion of the Jews religion, and of your own
country laws among certain pryuate persons of your own self: because
neither it appertains to mine office, nor I can discuss the^ which am
ignoraunte of your law, it were best for you to make an end of it your
selves. For I will meddle in no such matiers. With these words he caused them
to avoid from the place where he sat in judgment. The Greeks seeing this,
smote Sosthenes which was of the chief of the Sinagoge, because that he and
his household had taken Paul's part, forsakyng the Jews: and were more moved
with Sosthenes then with Paul, because they supposed that Paul could have done
nothing at Corinthe, unless that he had been maynteyned by Sosthenes. Yet for
all this, the proconsul would not meddle, seeing this business, but dissembleth
that he saw it. Forasmuch as the Romans hated the Jews, and yet put no
difference between a Jew and a christen man, the proconsull, which was a
Romayne, did not pass or regard what one Jew did unto another, being
perfect that that sort of people, had wont to be every where busy and full
of trouble and contencion.

But Paul having in mind the warnyng that god had given him, though he
perceived the rage of the Jews daily to increase more and more, yet he
continued there a good sort of days more. And at the last perceyuyng that
the gospel was well forward there, he thought it best to depart for a season and
to give place to the furious rageyng of the Jews. And so taking his leave of
y^ brethren, he appointed to sail into Siria, having Aquila with him and his
wife Priscilla. And forasmuch as Paul perceived that the Jews were most
moved, because that he a man borne under the Jews law, seemed to set no
store by the tradicions of the law, before he took shyppyng at Cenchrea,
which is the haven at Corinthe he shore his head, making a solemn vow
according as the custom was among the Jews.

He did not this craftily to color or to feign with them, but he had regard
unto charity, that they should not be offended. For ^is desire was to win
them all to the gospel, and therefore did he frame himself to al men's
appetites, as nere as he could, to thentent that he might win them all to
Christ. Among the Jews, he ordered himself as a Jew, and when he was emonge
those that were not circumcised, he also behaved himself as a man
uncircumcised. But thus bare he with them for a space, because they were so
wedded to supersticion, that they could not easily be plucked from it, until
such time as the truth of the gospel might more clearly spryng abroad. For
to make a vow and to shere thy head upon the same, is not that thing which of
it self is evil: but to put confidence in such Iewyshe ceremonies is
damnable. And in like manier, circumcision hurts not a man that believes in
Christ, neither yet to be uncircumcised, in which matier at a time it is the
part of charity to give place, until a man see opportunity, and in such wise
as when he shall have opportunity, he speak against the same. But in all other
matiers that of themselves are naught, we must not give place to any man's
weakness. For Paul never bare with the Gentiles in any matier of committing
aduoutrye, or wurshyppyng Idolles: but in famyliar conversation together, in
neglecting choice of meats, in cityng or allegeyng their Poets, sometime he
bare with them. So first they arrived at Ephesus, which is a city upon the
sea side in the less Asia, which properly and without any other addicion, had
wont to be called Asia. There he left Aquila and Priscilla, who were desirous
to tarry and to dwell at Ephesus. And himself entering into the Sinagoge of the
Jews that dwelte there, disputed with them. Of whom when he was desired to
continue there a great while, he excused himself, and took his leave of them,
and puttyng them in hope that he would shortly see them again, he
coumforted them in this wise: There is no remedy, I must needs keep this
feast that is now at hand, in Jerusalem, but I will return again unto
you, by gods grace. When he had spoken these words, he departed from
Ephesus, and sailed toward Jerusalem: and when he had arrived at Cesarea,
a city in y^ country of Palestine, he went up to Jerusalem, and saluted the
congregation. From thence he took his journey to Antioche that is in Syria.
After he had tarried there a while he went forewarde on his journey that he had
begone, going over all the country of Galacia, and Phrigia, confirmyng the
disciples faith in every place, wheresoever he met with any assembly of them.
Thus careful was Paul for his flock that he had won to Christ.

In the mean space one Apollos an Alexandrian borne, but one that kept the
Jews religion, a man that was well learned, and had good knowledge of holy
scriptures, came to Ephesus, where as Paul had left Priscilla and Aquila. This
Apollos was half a christen man. For he had learned the rudimentes and first
rewles of the ghospel, And knew but the baptism of John only.
of the christen men, and with feruente desire he did communicate the same to
others, that himself had learned, and such things as he knew of Jesus,
before that he the said Apollos was christened with Christ's baptism, (whereby
grace was more ple^tifully given) he taught diligently, but as yet he knew
not the said baptism of Christ, but knew only the baptysme of John, whereby
penance was taught and preached. This Apollos being not yet fully enstructed
in those things that Christ had taught, thought that sufficient: Whom when
Priscilla and Aquila heard boldly speak of Jesus, but yet in such sort
that they well perceived him to be not fully instructed in the principles of
the gospel, and seeing him endued with so many good qualities, that, as it
appeared, he would be an excellent preacher and setter forth of Christ's
name, they took him home with them, and seuerallye taught him more perfectly
the mysteries of the gospel, according to the doctrine that Paul had taught
them before. They refused not him to be a teacher, which though he were
diligent, yet was not perfect: and he on the other side disdayned not to be
monished of any manne what ever he were. They gave exaumple in so doing, that
such ought gently to be helped forwards, in whom any hope of doing well
remains. Again here is an exaumple, that we must gladly learn of any man
such things, the knowledge whereof cannot be let pass without peril of
damnacion. Apollos was christened in the name of Jesus, and received the holy
ghost. But than afterward he was desirous to go into Achaia, where as
Corinthe is, to the end that he might preach the gospel: the brethren
seeing him wyllyng of his own accord, did set him forwards, and more provoked
him to it, and wrote letters in commendacion of him, to the disciples in
Achaia, that they should receive him. For he over came the Jews myghtelye.
Who did after his cumming thither, much good unto the^, that had been
converted to the faith, and valiauntly did set forth the gospel. For the
holy ghost help to set forwards his eloquence that he had joined with
knowledge of the holy scriptures. With which weapons he being armed, did
stoutly put the Jews to silence, that continually contended against the young
sown corn of the gospel that was bladyng up, showing openly and also
playnelye by euydente testimonies of the scriptures, that Jesus was the same
Messiah, whom the Jews had so many hundred years looked for, and that all
things that the Prophets spoke before of Messiah, did agree in him.

The.xix. Chapter.

BUt even as Priscilla and Aquila had amended Apollos in such points as he
lacked, being necessary for a christen manne to have, so Paul finding
others in like taking, did. For whiles that Apollos was at Corinthe, which is
the chief city in Achaia: it chanced that Paul, after he had goen over the
other countries of Asia the less, which declyne most to the North and
East, returned to Ephesus. There found he certain of the disciples that were
no perfect Christians, which were in one flock among the other brethren.
Wherefore Paul to the intent that he might more perfectly instruct them,
asked whether that they had received the holy ghost, since the time that they
were converted to the faith. We have not heard whether there be any holy
ghost or no.
They, forasmuch as their error was of no malice, but of plain ignorance,
fra^kely answered and freely as it was in deed, and said: No, neither have we
ever heard yet hitherto, whether there be any holy ghost, that is given to
them that believe. Than said Paul, forasmuch as ye are taken for christen
men, whose baptism than were ye baptized with? They made answer: with the
baptism of John: for we thought that sufficient for us. Than said Paul: In
that have ye not done amiss, that in times past before the gospel came to
man's knowleage abroad, ye received John's baptism. But that is not sufficient
for your eternal salvation. For like as ye doctrine of John was not perfect,
but did only testify of Jesus that he was the true gyuer of salvation, who
should come after him, making ready their minds, that they should believe him
when he came: so did not John's baptism wholly justify, but only exhorted
men, that by repentance for their life mispe^t they should prepare their
hertes for the Physician that would strayghte afterward come, which with
his baptism through faith, would take away all manner of sins, and by his
spirit should enryche the minds of the faithful with heavenly gifts of
grace. This tradicion had the Apostles received of Jesus the Lord, that they
that believed in the gospel, should be christened in the name of the father,
of the son, and of the holy ghost. They that erred only through
simplicity, and for lack of knowleage only, deserved thus to be instructed.
And they being once warned hereof, obeyed their counselors, and immediately
were christened in the name of Jesus the lord. This done when Paul had laid
his hands on them, the holy ghost came down on them, and the thing it self
that ensued, did manifestly express what the visible token meaned. For they
did both speak diverse languages, and prophesied also of hidden and secret
things that were to come. The number of those persons that were men, amounted
even to a dosen or there about.

When Paul had this done, and as a man would say, had renewed his
authority, forasmuch as he being the preacher of the gentiles, had given the
holy ghost by laying on his hand over the faithful, even as the other
Apostles had done, he entryng into the Sinagoge of ye Jews that dwelled there,
openly and freely spoke to all men, preaching that hope of salvation was to be
obtained by Jesus only: which thing he did me then few days, for it was the
space of whole three months, disputyng of the kingdom of God, which is
heavenly and spiritual, against them that with tooth and nail stiffly vpheld
the carnal kingdom of the law. But when certain of the Sinagoge gave no
credence to those things, that were spoken of Paul, but stubbernely resisted,
insomuche that openly before the multitude they blasphemously spoke against the
doctrine of the gospel: Paul perceyuyng that it was to be feared, lest that
they that believed might be corrupted by their malice, left the synagoge of the
Jews, and did likewise separate the disciples from them, and yet he ceased
not in the mean season to preach the ghospel. But he daily disputed in the
school of one Tyrannus, having even than in mind, the image of a pure
church, that were not corrupted with the leaven of the synagoge, which
church should receive none but those that would learn, and that would
reiecte such as were praters, and blasphemous persons.

Thus did he continue by the space of two years, with such success, that not
only the Ephesians, but also diverse others, some Jews, and some Gentiles
(that resorted thither from that part of Asia the less, which properlye is
named Asia, where as Ephesus is) gave ear unto the gospel. And miracles did
cause them to believe his preaching, for god wrought both many, and also great
woonders by the hands of Paul, insomuche that he put away diseases, not with
words or by touching only, but also napkins and partlettes, which had
touched Paul's body, were carried to the sick, that were so faint that they
could not come to Paul, and with touching thereof as well diseases, as also
evil spirits were put away. So great confidence had Paul on Jesus whom he
preached.

Which thing when certain Jews perceived, which were of that sort of men,
that go about and for lucre do cast out evil spirits, with certain ceremonies
and solemn prescribed words, as it were of coniuracion, crakyng that they
had received this cunnyng of Solomon, whom they affirmed to be the author
thereof, they also attempted to cast out evil spirits by inuocacion of the
name of our lord Jesus, not because they intended to set forth the glory of
his name, or because they would endeavor themselves to do men good, but
because that they supposed thereby to get more advantage, and greater name.
Wherefore they chaungeyng certain words wherewith they had woonte to
conjure, said to the evil spirits: I conjure you in the name of Jesus, whom
Paul preaches, that ye depart. This especially did the seven sons of one
whose name was Sceua, which was a Jew, and one of the chief priests. And
when they attempted in this wise, to prove this kind of coniuration, Jesus I
kn^^e, and Paul I know: but who are ye?
on a certain manne that was possessed with an evil spirit, the evil
spirit answered to those coniurers: I know Jesus, by virtue of whose name,
ye go about to fear me, I know also Paul the servant and professor of
Christ, but what be you, that abuse the name of Jesus, and Paul, to your
lucre, whereas ye are the disciples neither of Jesus, ne yet of Paul? And
as soon as he had spoken these words, the man that was possessed with the evil
spirit, ^anne upon these exorcistes, and coniurers, and got the over hand
of them, insomuche that they had much a do to escape with their lives, and
scarce got away at last naked and wounded, out of the house. This thing after
it was bruted abroad, and known through out the city of Ephesus, both among
the Jews and the Gentiles that occupied there* they were sore afraid every
man, and much praised the name of the lord Jesus, which was so healthful to
all such as believed well, that it would not be applied to ye lucre or glory
of any man. And this the mischaunce of few, did profytte many. For many one
being afraid by the ensample of the sons of Sceua, and specially such as
had begone to believe the gospel, when as they saw that punishmente was ready at
hand for such, Many of them, which used curious crafts brought their books
and burned them before all men.
as called upon the name of Jesus with unclean hearts, they repaired to
Paul, confessing, and vtteryng their offenses, that by penance they might
escape the punishment of God. For the city of Ephesus was more then all other,
given to supersticious crafts, as this their own proverb does withnesse:
The Ephesians learning: by which proverb was sygnified sorceries and words of
coniuracion, which the Ephesians learned and used, that they might prosper and
have good hap in all things yt they went about, and might prevail against
others in any thing that they attempted. Wherefore many were there in that
city which being seduced, had either used such Iudaical coniurations, or else
had given credit unto them. And besides this, diverse of those that had used
magical and curiouse crafts, brought their books to the common market place,
and burned the^ in the sight of al persons. Whereof there was so great a
noumber, that the value of them, when it was rated by castyng accoumpte of it,
amounted to the sum of fifty thousand pieces of silver coin, every piece
being in value about a grote sterlyng or more. But the loss of this money
was great advantage to ye furtheryng of the gospel. For by means hereof,
the word of God did much increace and waxed strong, which word was to
their salvation that fully without glosyng and clokyng, did embrace it: but to
such, as did not uprightly walk therein, it was terrible.

When Paul had thus happily spedde by the space of two years, continuyng at
Ephesus, he was monyshed by the holy ghost, to depart thence, and so purposed
with himself to walk over Macedonia and Achaia, and than to take his iourneye
to Jerusalem, saying: I must see Rome also, but I will first go to
Jerusalem. When he had fully decreed thus with himself, he sent before him, a
couple of those that awayted on him, that is to say, Tymothee and Erastus,
unto Macedonie, to gather men's alms for succouryng those nedy that were at
Jerusalem, and that they might make ready their minds against Paul came.
But Paul himself stayed for a season in Asia.

About this time, a grievous commocion was stirred up against the gospel among
the Ephesians: but not by the Jews than, as it was accustomed before to be,
but by such as stycked ouermuche to the tradicion, that they had received of
their forefathers, as concerning the supersticious wurshippyng of their gods.
The Ephesians, as is before said, were wonderfullye given to curious learning,
and Diana (as the Gentiles supposed) had a great power in enchauntementes, and
therefore they said she had three faces or headdes, as Hecate had. This was
the cause that she was so greatly worshipped at Ephesus. Mark here now that
lucre and gaynes was the first occasion of this commocion, and the
supersticious people furtherers to the same. For there was at Ephesus in those
days, a certain man named Demetrius, a siluersmyth by his occupacion. This
Demetrius, where as he was a maker of silver shrynes or tabernacles for Diana,
because the moon in color somewhat resembles silver, procured for all that
were good crafts men of ye same occupacion, no small gaynes. Wherefore
Demetrius called together, al such as had advantage by making images of
Diana, and all crafts men of the same occupacion whom he knew would favor
his cause, because they were of the same craft, and made a sedicious oracion
in this wise: Masters, it is time for us to look to our profit with all our
endeavor. I need not make rehearsal, for it is well known unto you all, that
our craft is very gaynefull throughout all Asia, by reason that Diana is so
worshipped, which religion if it should fail, needs must it follow, that our
advantage shall be small. But ye both hear and see, (for the matter is plain
and open) that this fellow Paul has preached here these.ii. years now, that
those gods, which are made by the hands of man, are no gods: neither any
image to have any power of the gods in them, that is either graven of
tymbre, or made of any metal in mouldes. And by this his preaching has he
persuaded many, not here in Ephesus only, but also through all Asia, and
has turned an huge noumbre of people from worshipping of the gods. Now
forasmuch as this craft is our living, and thereby we find also our
howsholdes, what shall else come of it, but if this his preaching continue, our
gaynes and living will decay, and we shall fall into poverty? Wherefore if we
should now let this matter slip, we might well be accoumpted very slack in
lokyng to our own profits. But if there be any man here present, that passes
light on this daungier of leesyng his profit and gaynes, by the decay of our
craft, whereby we now have great lucre and advantage, yet the common religion
ought to move all men, forasmuch as if we suffer Paul to continue in doing
these things without punishemente, we see it is to be feared, lest that the
temple of the great goddess Diana, which is now of great* fame and renoume,
and whereunto men of their zeal and devotion have now daily great recourse,
and which is enriched with great offerynges, shall in process be had in no
reputacion at all. For who is so mad to wurshyp the temple if he be persuaded
that the patron of the temple is no god? And by this mean will it come to
pass, yt a goddess so full of majesty, and being at this day for many
causes, justly had in great honor, shall by little and little be rooted out of
men's minds and hertes, whereas she is now worshypped, not in this city only
and in Asia, but also through out all the whole world. And therefore if ye
suppose it be a wise man's part to see to his profit, in case ye think it
be a godly thing to defend the gods of our countreye from dishonor, now
show your selves to be men outright, and help to withstand this mischief
that is at hand.

With this oracion the minds of the multitude were so stirred up, that every
one of them began to cry with great lowdnesse* Diana the great goddess of
Ephesus. With this same so sedicious a clamoure, all the whole city of Ephesus
was stirred up, and as the people ran hastily, the multitude of them being
clean out of al order, they met together, and made straight way to the
common place of the city, where plays and syghtes are wont to be showed, and
in such a place commonly the people, being in any rage or fury, is most
master, and begins frayes and sedicions, and thither they haled with them
by force and violence, a couple of men being Macedonians borne, that is to
wete Caius and Aristarchus, which were two companions of Paul's. But when
Paul understanding what had been done, was in mind to come forth before the
multitude, partly to help his fellows, and partly to persuade and pacify the
people, the disciples would not suffer him, thynkyng it to be an unadvised
part for him to deliver himself to the multitude, being in such a rage,
seeing that he could thereby nothing at all further the ghospel. Besides the
disciples, others also the pieres and chief rewlers of Asia, which although
they had not hitherto professed the name of Christ; yet inasmuche as they
wished nothing but good to Paul, sent word unto him and required him in
their names, that he would not put himself in daungier with the multitude,
which than was much moved against him, and up in a great roar. In the mean
space there was among the people, many so^dry murmouringes, never an one like
another. For (as in such cases commonly it chances) one cried that one
thing was to be done, another another thing. For the multitude was gathered
together of diverse nations, and they among themselves of sundry minds,
insomuche that some there were, yea, the most part of them, that wiste not
what the matter was, that they were come thither for.

Wherefore the very time required that some man should make an oracyon unto
them, which was in favor with the people, that this sudden commocion might
by some means be assuaged and pacified. Than was there one Alexander compelled
to stand forth out of the thickest prease of the people, by reason that the
Jews did thruste him forward to cease this sedicious commocion with some
oracion. For no man durst be so bold, as to treat or to make any words
of the matter before the multitude, that was than in a rage, and in diverse and
sondrye minds, forasmuch as whatsoever should be spoken, it could not be
chosen but that one part or other would be offended with it. Wherefore he
being so thruste forwards, beckened with his hand, and desired them to give
ear unto him, and was than about to have made some answer. But when as the
multitude understood that Alexander was a Jew, (which people wurshippe one
God, and abhors the gods of the Gentyles,) then was this tumulte eftsoon
renewed, forsomuche as they supposed that he would say somewhat to the
dishonor of their goddess Diana. Wherefore they all cried with one voice.
Diana the great goddess of Ephesus. And thus they continued crying, by the
space of almost two hours.

But at the last when as the Scribe of the city had entreated the multitude to
keep silence, Alexander spoke unto them in this wise: Ye men of Ephesus, for
what purpose do ye make all this clamor and buisinesse? For what man is there
living so ignorant, but that he knows how the city of Ephesus does
wurship great Diana, and her image that fell from heaven? And forasmuch as no
man says contrary to the things that ye affirm, ye need not to make all
this business, but ye must go peaceably to work and do nothing rashely. For
ye have brought hither these two men, which have neither committed sacrilege,
by robbyng any Church or other holy place, ne yet blasphemy against your
goddess. If it so were tha^ the people might justly flock together and
revenge their quarrel. But if that Demetrius the siluersmithe, and other his
adherentes of the same occupacion, that were the occasion of all this
buisinesse, have any matter to lay to any man's charge, they need not thus to
run into the open place, which was made for an other purpose, that is to
say, for enterludes, and pageauntes, wrastlyng, and such other syghtes, nor
yet thus sediciously to make this unlawful assembly, with such great
clamoure and wonder. For there be laws here in this city, there is sessions
kept, and there be officers sent from the Emperor, by the name of proconsuls,
or lord deputies that may discuss such causes, and may end all
controversies, and matters of vitiaunce, and may punyshe the malefactors. Let
them there plead their matters, that were the occasion of this assembly,
forasmuch as it apperteyneth not to the commons to meddle with their private
matters. Yet if it were so that the matter were public, and pertayned to the
commons, it were not for all that needful to discuss it so sediciously: But if
ye require that any thing be done, it may be brought to pass in a lawful
assemblye, called together by those that have authority, and in due form,
accordyngly. Now is it to be feared, lest that we be complained of unto
thofficers for this co^mocion, and that it be thought that we went about to
make an insurreccion, seeing that we can allege no probable cause, wherefore
this assemblye of the people was gathered together into the common place of
enterludes, sightes, and games. When he had thus said, the multitude departed.

The.xx. Chapter.

AFter that this commocion was clean ceased, Paul called the disciples
together, and exhorted them steadfastly to continue in those matters, that they
had taken in hand, concerning their faith in Christ: than he enbraced them,
and bad them farewell, and so departed toward Macedonia. And after that he
had walked over the parties of Macedonia, and had given exhortacion at large
to the congregacions wheresoever he chanced to meet with any of them, wylling
them to continue in the purity of the gospel, and that they should profit
therein, he came to that part which is properly called Greece, in which Greece,
Achaia is situated: Where, after that they had continued by the space of three
months, and were about to depart thence and to sail into Syria, he
perceived that the Jews had laid awayt to hurt him in that journey by water,
he therefore thought it better to take shyppyng at an other haven, and to
return to Macedonia again, and from thence to sail to Syria, where as he
first arrived, when he came to Macedonia. At this iourneye Sosipater of Berrea
son unto Pyrthus, and besides him Aristarchus, and Secundus, being both of
them Thessalonians, and besides these, also Caius of Derba, and Timothy were
with us. And besides them Tichicus and Trophimus, both of them being of Asia.
These men whiles that Paul tarried in Macedonia, had goen before to make ready
all things that were necessari, to enter the sea without daungier, and tarried
our coming at Troas. We passed by Macedonia, and so came to Philippos: From
thence, after the days of sweet bread, which follow easter, immediately we
departed, and within five days we came unto them at Troas, where we tarried
seven days.

There chanced a wondrefull notable thing. For upon one of the Sabbath days,
when the disciples were assembled, as their custom was, to break bread,
Paul playing each where the part of a good pastor, refreshed their minds
with preaching of scriptures, and forasmuch as he was purposed the next day
to depart thence, he continued so preaching unto them until it was far
forth nights. And lest that night might have been occasion to break of
this delectable and pleasant sermon, there were many candelles in the sollare
whereas we were than assembled. Among the multitude there was a certain young
manne, whose name was Eutichus, that sat in one of the wyndores. This young
man by reason that Paul continued talkyng so long, wexed slepie, and at the
last so sore came the sleep upon him, that he fell flatlyng down to the
ground three floores high: by and by men ran to him, but he was found
dead, and brought into the house. When as Paul perceived that, he came down,
and after the ensample of the prophet Hely, he bended his body, and lay upon
him, as though that he did by enbracyng, cherishe or keep warm^ the dead
body. When he had so done, he turned himself to the disciples, that were
much troubled with this sodeyne chance, and said: be ye nothing troubled
with this chance, there is yet life in him: for the body is not clean dead.
When he had thus comforted them, he went again up into the sollare, and
brake the bread, and eat thereof: and after this, when he had again so long
commoned with them that it began to be light, and that the break of day
appeared, he took his leave of them, and so at length departed. So paynefull a
thing is it, for a most loving father to depart from his dear children. And
they that remained with the young manne, brought him alive and whose into the
sollare again. Which thing did not a little refreshe the minds of all that
were there present. For it was not sittyng, that that same word that brings
health to all men, should have been occasion of the young man's death.

And we, when we had taken shippyng at Troas, sailed to Asson, which is a
city nere to the sea side within the country of Troas. For Paul had so
determined that we should go thither before by water, and he would follow by
land, either because it was more safer so to do, or else that he might
salute the more by the way. And after that we met together at Asson, and had
received Paul into the ship, we came all together to Mitilene, which is a
city on the sea side in the Isle of Lesbus. Thence departed we and the next
day after, we came against Chios Ylande. Likewise again the day following,
we arrived at the Ylande of Samos, and from thence sailed to Trogillion, that
is a city on the sea bank of Asia, directly against Samos. There tarried we
the same night, and the next day after, came to Mileton, which is a city
in Caria. And although that we in our saylyng by the coasts of Asia, should
first come to Ephesus, then to Trogillion or Mileton, yet Paul had purposed
with himself to pass by Ephesus, lest that he should spend away the time
tarying in Asia, if it should have chanced that he could not safely, for
watch being laid for him, sail into Siria. For he hastened to keep his
witsontide in Jerusalem, if he possibly might so do. Yet lest that he should
seem either not to regard, or else to hate the Ephesians, he sent from Mileton,
some that should will thauncient curates of the congregation of Ephesus, whom he
had left charged with the same congregation, to come unto him.

To whom after they were come, he spoke in this wise. Brethren, I shall not
need to rehearse unto you my upright behavior in preaching the ghospel. It is
not unknown unto you your selves, which have seen the same, how I have
behaved my self among you, all the while even from the first day that I came
into Asia, until this hour: and that I sought not mine own glory, or lucre,
but that I have obeyed the commandment of our Lord Jesus Christ in preaching
his gospel, and have in all things been comfortable unto his will, inasmuche as
I followed his steps, who made low, humbled himself, and delivered himself
to be afflicted and tormented, and to dye, that he might cleanse and establyshe
his church. Even so likewise has been my conversation in setting forth the
gospel, with all humility or lowlynesse, yea and also shame, which I have
suffered of the enemies of the gospel, with often tears which I have shed
being careful for the congregation, with much affliccion, or trouble that I
have been in, through the deceytes of the Jews, that cannot abide that the
benefit of the gospel should be communicated and partened unto the Gentiles.
And yet none of al these mischaunces have troubled my mind so greatly, that I
have at any time for fear of affliccion, let pass any thing that apperteined
to your health, neither yet have I spared, though it were with daungier of my
life, to open unto you any thing that might be profitable for you, and to
instruct you both openly in the synagoges, and also privily within me^nes
houses, as occasion has served: not preaching unto you, as the Jews minds
were that I should have done, that is to say, circumcision, observing of
sabbath days, and washynges, but repentance for your life that ye did lead
before, which god requires in all men, that he may save all men: and full
confidence in our lord Jesus Christ, whose gospel whosoever believes, shall
be saved whether he be a Jew, or a Greek, whether circumcised, or else
uncircumcised. And therefore the same favor and grace which is indifferently
proffered unto all men, I have indifferently preached unto all men, not having
respect to the person, state, or degree of any manne, nor being feared or
discouraged by the malice of the Jews, who for the setting forth and
magnifying of the law, do withstand the gospel: nor yet driven from it by
the fiercenes of the Gentiles, which do so stiffelye uphold and maynteyne the
supersticion which they have received of their forefathers. For thatsame
affliccion, and persecucion in which I was here, did move me, rather because I
saw that the congregation was in some daungier, lest any man being offended
with mine adversity, might be alienated and turned away from the gospel,
then because that I passed for ye shame that I was put to, or for the sorrows
or woe which I suffered and endured. And in case I did at any time eschew
peril or daungier, I did it rather for your pleasure, to satisfye your
appetites, having respect to your profit, then because I cared or passed any
thing for the loss of mine own life.

And I am very glad that I have so done. Yea and now, though I be free in
body and not in any bands, yet being in spirit or mind, as it were, in
hold, I take my journey toward Jerusalem, where I am not very certain
what will become of me, but only because that the holy ghost in every city,
partly by mouths of the prophets, and partly in mine own mind, does
sygnifie unto me, that it shall come to pass that I shall be both fettered and
tormented. Which thing though I both believe and know certaynelye, shall
chance unto me, yet none of al these things make me afraid to execute the
duty of an apostle, which I am called unto, though I should be assured to
abide the pains of death for my labor. For it is not this life that I so
much regard, which cannot perish being under the tuicion of Christ, but
more do I esteem my masters commandment, then my life: and that I may end
this my course in preaching the ghospel, as cherefully, as I have hitherto
joyfully abyden it. Nothing is there that more deliteth me, then that the
gospel may be furthered by my affliccions. I have delight in nothing else but
still to run forwards in the race of the gospel, wherein the lord has set
me, until that I come to the mark, being well assured that I shall
accordyngly be rewarded at his hands, which is master of the game, when he
shall see time at his own pleasure, who is without deceit. I auaunced not my
self unto this office, but the lord Jesus set me in this room, for to preach
as well to the Jews, as also to the Gentiles these most gladsome tidings,
which is, that it has pleased god freely to save every man by beleuyng in the
gospel. Wherefore willyngly and with all my heart will I now fulfill this my
vocacion, not regardyng whether I live or dye.

As long as I conveniently might, I was present with you, and help toward
your salvation, teaching, admonishyng, exhortyng, comfortynge and rebukyng, as
I saw occasion, with often recourse to see you. But now am I certain by
inspiration of the holy ghost, that ye shall never more see me in this world
again, neither ye Ephesians, nor yet any others that are inhabitours of the
less Asia, unto whom I have already preached the kingdom of God. I have done
my duty with all diligence, and uprightly. Wherefore seeing that I must
depart from you without any hope of return, this do I proteste before you
all, that if any man peryshe either by his own, or else by others defaulte, I
am not gylty of their death. I have showed every man the true way to
everlasting life. I have opened unto you the will of God, how he is minded to
save mankind, and what they must do that continue in steadfast belefe toward
our lord Jesus, in such wise that no man can say for excuse of himself,
that he knew it not. I my self have given you ensaumple, both doing, and also
sufferyng all that I might, to have you continue in purity of the gospel. No
man's death can be imputed to me. And now it arises not of my free will that
I must hence depart from you, nor yet do I for fear of any persecucion
convey my self away, but wittingly and willyngly go I to undoubted daungier
of my life, being so wylled by the spirit of Christ. Wherefore what ye cannot
come by through my presence, that must ye supplye with your own dylygence.
See that your own hertes fail you not, or else that your foot slide not back
from those things, that ye have well entered into, but ye that are the elders,
and unto whom I have committed cure of this flock, watch, partly for your
own behalfes, lest ye be seduced by false apostles, and partly for the flocks
sake, which ye have taken in hand to feed. I have uprightly executed mine
office, that was assygned and deputed to me of our lord. Take ye like care
and thought, and with semblable good will and vprightnes of behavior, for the
flock that the holy ghost has made you bisshoppes of, that is to say,
overseers, to take diligent head that Christ's sheep lack no wholesome food,
and not to play the parts of woulues, but of faithful shepeherdes, toward
gods own congregation, which ye must not neglygently look upon,
forasmuch as god did set so much store by it, that he purchased it by the
blood sheddyng of his only begotten son. Ye must therefore beware that in no
wise the ware which god has so derely boughte, may perish or miscary
through your negligence.

I do not warn you of these things aforehande so earnestly for nothing. For
tight certainly assured I am, that you shall not still have Paul's with you,
but after my departing, fierce rauenyng woulues shall prease in among you, as
it were in to foldes destitute of the shepeherde, which shall not spare the
flock, but shall assaye by all means to disperse and scatter the
congregation. Than it is to be feared, lest that such as are weak, being
even overthrown with adversity, will forsake the gospel. But yet is there
another danger much greater then this, that I have already spoken. There
shall come not only from foreyn places, which by fear, by threatnyng, by
decytfull persuasions, and by feigned and cloked holiness, shall endeavor
themselves to corrupt your pure living, and to withdraw your lybertye, that
ye have by the gospel of Jesus Christ: but also even among your selves
shall certain men arise, which betraying this concord and unity of minds,
that ye are now in, shall speak wicked and pernicious things, and such
things as shall much swerue from the syneere verity of the gospel: And
such speakers shall not mean, entende, or labor, ye Christ's flock may be
safely preserved unto him, but to have dysciples in their own name to follow
their tails, to the entente that they may seem to be no small fools; as
though they were afeard less they should seem preachers nothing excellent,
but altogether unlearned, unless they should teach some new strange poinetes
of doctrine, of their own brain. But denylishe is that new inuencion, when
men shall add unto the gospel, which of it self is sufficient. He that is a
pastor or shepherd in deed, had rather that Christ had dysciples, then
himself to have disciples. And of him does a good pastoure receive meat
wherewith to feed them. But these men for to get themselves renoume, and for
their own pryuate and worldly lucre, make of Christ's disciples, their own
dysciples, and will be thought to be founders of the doctrine of the gospel,
whereof we in very deed are but stewardes and ministers. Wherefore the greater
the daungier is that is at hand, so much the more dilygently watch ye,
having still in mind how that I (when I was in Asia by the space of three
years) ceased not day and night to admonish and warn every one of you with
tears.

And thus brethren, because I must parforce depart from you, I commite you all
to god (who will not forsake his flock) and to preachinge the words of his
gospel, wherein whatsoever parsones do syncerely and vprightlye use
themselves, and do rather set forth the frank bounty, and goodness of
god, which he freely gives to all men, then the justice of the law: them
will the favor of God help forewarde in the same. I for my part according to
my duty, have cast the foundation: but god, that works all these things by
me, may build on it, that the same which is begone, may according to his
will, be finished, and like as it has hitherto chanced unto you, by professyng
the gospel to be the sons of God by adopcion, so ye continuyng in this
godly purpose* may atteyne to ye heritage which is promised unto all such,
as are sanctified by the grace of god, whether they be Jews, or else Gentyles.
Ye have seen how careful I have been, what travail I have taken, ye have
seen what perilles I have sustained for your sakes, sekyng of you no reward
for it, neither honor, neither advantage of gaynes, in somuche, that I have
not received so much as necessaries at your hands, which the other apostles
abroad do, and I both lawfully and also with good conscience might have
received. I never desired gold, or silver, or apparel of any manne. For (as
it is not unknown unto you all) these hands of mine have sufficientlye
ministered all things that either I or my fellows with me neded. I might have
taken these things of you, knowing that a labourer is worthy his wages and
hiere, but I thought it better to look for all my reward at gods hand: and I
endeavored my self by all means to give you a right pexfite ensample, that
ye which have by succession received the charge of the flock, may perceive it
to be the duty of a good shepeherde, that whereas he refuses no labor to
profit his flock, yet that he absteyne from receyuyng reward of any man,
because of the weak, lest that any man be the more loathe, or may bear the
wurse will to the gospel, for that he is compelled to find his curate, or
else lest any manne pass less on the words of the pastors, because that he
may think them in his daungier, forasmuch as they received benefit at his
hand. For the nature of men is such, that they, (after what sort I can not
tell,) set less by them to whom they have been any thing beneficial. And
although it be right, And to remember the words of the Lord Jesus.
that they which bestow the richesse and treasures of the gospel on you, be
helped again of you, with your temp^rall goods, which be so vile in
respect of the other, that there is no comparison between them, yet I knowing
many weak persons to be among you, would not give any man occasion to
ymagine evil of us. Endeavor your selves to follow this mine ensample as nere
as ye may, having still in mind, what our lord Jesus said: It is better to
give then to receive.

When Paul had thus said, he kneled down as his custom was, and all they
likewise did the same and made their prayers. Than every man wept excedyngly,
insomuche that they took him about the neck, and kyssed him, as taking gredely
the fruicion of him that streyghtwayes should be plucked away from them: for
every man was sorye in his mind for his departure, but most specially for one
word that Paul had spoken when he said that they should see his face never
more in the world. When this was done, they brought him all a long to the
ship (as their duetye was,) and looked after him, whiles he sailed, as far
as they could see him.

The.xxi. Chapter.

AND after we had set up sail, and were goen out of sight of them yt stood
on the bank lokinge after us, we sailed straight forth and arrived at ye
Ylande called Chous, and next day after at Rhodes, and thence forth till we
touched at Patara, which is a city of Licia, nere to the sea side. There
found we a ship, yt was redye to sail toward Phenice and we took shyppyng
there, and sailed therein. But when the Ylande of Cypres appeared unto us, we
leauyng it on the left hand, sailed toward Syria, and arrived at Tire,
which is a city situate on the sea bank of Phenice, as Sydon is likewise. We
desired rather to sail straight forth to Palestyne, but because Tire was a
mart town, the master of the ship would needs set his marchaundyse on
land there.

But when as we found some dysciples there also, we tarried with them seven
days. Among them were some, which being enspired with the spirit of
prophecye, counseled Paul, that he should in no wise go to Jerusalem. But
yet for all that, when the seven days were expired, we departed from Tire, all
the disciples with their children and wives accompanying and bringyng us out of
the city to the sea bank. Where after we had kneled down and made our
prayers with one consent, and had taken our leave one of an other: we took
shyppyng, and they returned home again.

From Tire we sailed to Ptolomaida, which is a city on the sea, nere to the
hill named Carmelus. Here we saluted our brethren, and remained one day with
them. Next day after, Paul and we went forth on our journey, and came to
Cesarea, a city of Palestine, and entered into the house of Philip, which
first of all had preached the gospel to the chaumberlayne, and to the
Samaritanes, and was one of the seven deacons, that the apostles had instituted
and ordained at Jerusalem. With him we abode. This man had four daughters all
unmarried, which had abundantly the spirit of prophecye, according to the
prophecye of Iohel.

And when we had continued soiourning in his house certain days, there came a
Prophet from Iewry, whose name was Agabus. He taking his lodgeing among us,
and bayting there, took Paul's gyrdle, which after he had knotted about his
own legs, according to the custom of the old prophets, which had wount
to express before by some visible token, that thing that they prophesied of,
thorough the inspiracion of the holy ghost, said: Thus says the holy
ghost. He that owes this gyrdle, shall so be bound of the Jews at
Jerusalem, and they shall deliver him into ye hands of the Gentiles.

We being much feared with* these words, and the dysciples also that
dwelled there with many weeping teres desired him, that he should not commit
ne put himself into the hands of the Jews at Jerusalem. This was the godly
affeccion and zele of them, that were loathe to have so excellent a pastor to
peryshe. But Paul, which had a more certain answer of the holy ghost in
his mind, and knew that he should first go to Jerusalem, and should after
that see Rome, said unto them: wherefore do ye make my heart sorry with your
vain tears? For the daungier that the Prophets warn me of, does nothing
move me, but your douloure and sorrow makes me to be sorry and pensyfe. I am
fully minded to further that thing which the holy ghost wylleth me, namely the
gospel. I nothing fear bonds, which I have been well enured with. For god
forbid, that I for fear of enpriso^ment, should leave of from furthering of
the gospel, seeing that I am ready, yea, if it were to dye at Jerusalem, for
my Lord Jesus sake. Let Paul lie in chains, so that the gospel may have
free liberty to pass. Let Paul lose his life, so that the glory of Jesus name
may lively spryng and flouryshe among all men. I am desirous of life for none
other end, but that I may profit the gospel. But otherwise I would reckon
it great advantage gotten, to be shortly ryd out of this life for Christ's
sake. Wherefore do not ye mourn for that thing that I my self am desirous of,
(if it shall so please God,) and cease ye therefore to make my mind pensyfe
with your weeping and waylyng, for I cannot chose but be sad, seeing my friends
sad. To these his words, wha^ we had nothing to answer, and saw him fully
bent to go to Jerusalem, we suffered him to depart, saying: the will of the
Lord be fulfilled. For these ought to be the words of true Christians, and
though they have not ye same words still in their mouths, yet must they
continually think them in their hertes, so that in adversity, as well as
prosperity, still must they say: The will of the lord be fulfilled.

And so when we had tarried a few days at Cesarea, we made ready our selves
to take our journey toward Jerusalem. And some of the disciples followed
Paul, and went in cumpany with us from the city of Cesarea, bringing with
them a certain man named Muason, which was a Ciprian borne, with whom we
should^ host at Jerusalem. For he was known to be a good and godly man, for
he had than of long time believed the gospel, and had persisted and continued
in the sincerite of the faith. But when we were come to Jerusalem, the
brethren gladly and joyfully received us. And Paul the next day taking us
with him, went to James his house the just, which was called the brother of
the Lord. For he was instituted of the Apostles, bishop of Jerusalem. And
thither assembled all the elders. Whom as soon as Paul had euerychone
saluted, he rehearsed to them in order, what God had wrought among the Gentiles
by his ministerye, emonge whom he had now a good sort of years preached the
gospel.

brother how many thousand Jews there are which believe, and they are all
earnest folowers over the law. And they are infourmed of the, that thou
teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles, to forsake Moises, and
say that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to live after
the customs. What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together: For
they shall hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to the. We
have four men, which have a now on them: Them take and purify thy self
with them, and do cost on them, that they may shave their heads: and all
shall know that those things, which they have heard concerning the, are no
thing: but that thou walk and kepest the law. When they heard all the
matter they glorified the Lord, that had also powered his grace upon the
Gentyles. But forasmuch as Paul was accused to many of the Jews, to be one
that abhorred Moses law, and that he in setting forth the benefyte that came
by the gospel, yielded less to the obseruacio^ of the law, then he ought to
do: to the intent that a remedy might be found for this inconvenience also,
they said unto him: brother Paul, said they, thou see how many thousand
Jews be he^e that believe the gospel, and all these are much affeccionate to
the law of Moses. And a rumor there is come to their ears, which we know
to be false, that thou teacheste the Jews, which are among the Gentyles, to
forsake and renounce Moses law, so that they neither circumcise their
children, ne keep the trade of their forefathers, as concerning choice of
meats, keeping of the Sabbothe days, washyng, and such other things, as the
Jews, which are not conuersaunte with the Gentyles, do with great devotion,
observe and follow. These men, being restrained by an act made of their
forefathers, are indifferently contented, that the Gentiles be not burdened
with the law. But that those, which are Jews borne, should be led away from
the obseruacion of the law, to the Gentiles kind of life, they can in no wise
abide. Wherefore we must take here good head, that no sedicion be made about
this matter. What remains tha^ to be done? First it cannot be chosen, but
that the multitude must be called together. For it will soon be known, that
thou art come. Wherefore to the entente that thou may be out of this
suspicion, follow our counsel. Here be among us four men, which according
to the custom of the Jews, have taken a vow on them, join the with them,
and fulfill together all solemn ceremonies, as they do, that desire to be
purified and made holy after their vow: and if there be any thing besides that
is to be bestowed on sacrifice or offeringes, bestow like cost as they do,
until such time that they have shaven their heads. And in so doing, every
man shall know for a suertie, those things to be false, that be rumoured
abroad of the, and they shall also perceive, that thou in such forte besides
do preach the gracious benefit of the gospel, that it is without reprofe
of those, that keep the ceremonies of the law, which God delivered them, and
other tradicions of their elders, wha^ they see thee do the same, which some
had reported the to disprove. And by this means shall the Jews cease to
speak evil of the, which are so many in number, that they must needs be had
inestimacion and not neglected.

But as for the Gentyles, that are converted to the faith we have writ but of
late unto them, as it was agreed upon, and decreed by the apostles and the
whole cumpanye of dysciples, that they shall not be compelled to keep Moses
law, saving only that they absteyne from that flesh, that is sacrificed unto
ydolles, from blood, from strangled beasts, and from aduoutry.

Than Paul did after this council of James and of the brethren, and taking
unto him those four persons, which had solemnly made a vow, went into the
temple, and there professynge that his days of purifying were finyshed, he
omitted ne let pass no ceremonye, until that sacrifyce was offered up for
every one of them. All this required seven days space for the accomplyshement
thereof. Which being almost expired, certain Jews that believed not, which
before had seen him in Asia, and there raised commocion against him, when as
they saw Paul in the temple, they stirred up the people, and laid hands on
Paul, crying: Ye me^ of Israel help: this is he, whom you have by report
heard of, that has wandered over all countries, and has taught in all
places a new doctrine against this people, which God chose severally to
himself, against our law also, which we received of God, and against this
temple, which is had in great honor through all the whole world. And yet is
not this wicked person so contented, but has moreover brought with him into
this our temple both Greeks, and others, that are not circumcised, and has
profaned or polluted and suspe^ded this holy place. (For during the time that
Paul had been in the city, they had daily seen in his cumpanye, one Trophimus
which was an Ephesian borne, and thereby they coniectured, And all the city
was moved. etc.
that Paul had brought him into the temple.) With this troublesome noise all
the city was raised, and the multitude flocked together. And they took Paul
and drew him out of the temple, (as a man worthy to be delivered into the
hands of the furious rageyng people, to do with him what they would, and
forthwith the doors of the temple were shut fast up, that he might have no
place whither he might safely escape. For they sought opportunity, that is to
say, a time and way conueniente to kill him, which thing was not lawefull
for their religion to do in the temple,) as though it were not an ungodly and
a wicked thing in any place else to sley an innocente.

unto a stayre, it fortuned that he was borne of the soldiers, for the
violence of the people. For the multitude of the people followed after crying:
away with him. In the mean space, tidings came to the captain marcial of
the Romayne army, that all the city of Jerusalem was raised up. The captain
forthwith taking and joining unto him soldiers, with their under captains,
hastened to them. But when the Jews saw the captain marciall hastening
toward them with harnessed men, they surceassed, and left smytyng of Paul.
And when the captain was come some what nere, he commanded them to lay hands
on Paul, And when he could not know the certainty. etc.
and to bind him with two chains, supposyng him to be some heinous
malefactoure, forasmuch as the multitude ordered him so roughly and so sore.
That done, the captain inquired of the Jews what he was, and what he had
committed. But when he could have no certain knowledge, by reason of the
troublous noise that they made on each side, roryng and crying with a loud
voice, one one thing, and another another thing, he commanded that Paul
should be brought into the castle, bound as he was, that he might know the
truth within the place of defense, and of safe custody, the people being set
aparte. And when as Paul came to the stayghers of the castle, he was carried of
the soldiers, for fear lest ye multitude should violently take him away.
For they feared lest they would hurt him before he could be conueyghed into
the castle. For the multitude of the people followed even to the very staighers
of the castle, crying out as high as they could, away with him, dyspatche
him, away with him.

But after they came to the entry of the hold, Paul being desirous to
satisfye the mind of the Jews that made this business, said to the captain
marciall, may it please you to give me leave to speak unto you? The marciall
answered: can thou skill of the greek tongue? For Paul had spoken those
words in Greek. Art not thou (said the marciall) the same Egipcian, that
have made commocion before likewise, and that leaddest four thousand
murderers hence into the deserte? Paul answered: I am not he whom you take
me for, but I am a Jew borne, and my natyue country is Tar^us, a noble city
in Cilicia. But I pray you give me license to speak my mind to the people.
Which wha^ he had permitted him, Paul standing on the steps, beckened with
his hand and certified the people by tokens, that he would speak unto them.
And streyghtwayes silence was made, and he began to speak on this wise, in the
Hebrewe tongue.

The.xxii. Chapter.

YE men which be here present, partly by lynage brethren, and partly for
your ancient years and dignity, fathers, give ear to me, whiles that I
purge my self of those things, whereof I am falsely accused unto you. Wha^
Paul had spoken these words in manier of a preamble, ye multitude heatinge him
speak Hebrewe, made ye more silence, whither it were because yt every man
understood this language, or else because ye al men bear more favor to their
own country speech, the^ to any other. Than did Paul proceed and go forth
in his tale in this wise. To the intent that ye may perceive me to have
committed nothing blasphemously, either against this Judicial people, or
against Moses law, or else against the temple: I am a Jew borne, my father
and my mother both Jews, and borne I was at Tarsus, a city in Cilicia. But
brought up was I in this city, at the feet of a man, that ye all knew well
enough, whose name was Gamaliel, and even from my chyldehoode was I diligently
instructed in the law of my country, earnestly bent to the honoring of the
true God, in such sort as ye do to this present time: insomuche that I, for
the affeccion that I bare to the law, did persecute this doctrine of the
gospel, which I now profess, pursuyng such as professed the same, not to
prison and bands only, but also to death, entendyng nothing else then
persecucion, with sore threatenings, and sundry kinds of death against the
professors of the gospel, byndyng and castyng into prison, both man and
woman, that stycked to the said doctrine. And that I tell nothing otherwise
then truth, he can bear me witness which was than the high priest and all
the other auncientes with him, from whom I received letters and took my
journey toward Damasco, that I might bring the^ prisoners from thence to
Jerusalem, which pro^essed Christ's name, to the entente that they might be
punyshed, according to the dyscrecion of the priests and elders.

And it fortuned (as I made my journey, and was come nygh unto Damasco) about
none, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me, and I
tell unto the yerth, and I heard a voice saying unto me. Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? And I answered: what art thou Lord? And he said unto me:
I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest. And they that were with me,
saw verily a light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that
spoke with me. And I said: what shall I do Lord? And the Lord said unto me:
arise, and go into Damasco, and there it shall be told the of all things,
which are appointed for the to do. And when I saw nothing for the
bryghtnesse of the light, I was led by the hand of them that were with me* and
came into Damasco: And one Ananias a perfect manne (and as pertaynyng to the
law, having good report of all the Jews which dwelt there) came unto me,
and stood and said unto me. Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same
hour I received my sight, and saw him. And he said: the God of our fathers
has ordained the before, that thou should know his will, and should here
the voice of his mouth, for thou shall be his witness unto all men of those
things which thou have seen and heard. And now why tariest thou? Arise, and
be baptized, and wash away thy sins in calling on the name of the Lord.
This mind did I than bear them, for none other cause, then for the affeccion
that I had to the law, and to our relygion, which I had received of my
forefathers, which thing is the occasion that ye now at this present are so
much against me. Now will I tell you, by what occasion I changed my mind,
which when ye shall perceive, perchance ye also will turn your minds. For
it chanced, when as I went thither, and was almost at Damasco, about high
noone, sodaynlye a great light compassed me about from heaven, wherewyth
stricken I was, and I fell down to the ground, and heard a voice speak unto
me from heaven, saying: Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me? Unto whom,
when I had made answer: What art thou lord? the voice said again: I am
Jesus of Nazareth whom thou pursuest. But my companions that were with me saw
the light, and were sore afraid, as for the voice that spoke unto me, they
heard it not. Than said I: Lord what is thy will that I should do? The
lord made answer again in this wise: Arise and go to Damasco. There shall
each thing that thou must do, be told thee. And where mine iyes were so
daseled with the brightness of that light, that I could see nothing at all, my
fellows led me by the hand, until I came to Damasco. There met I with a
good man, and one that for his vpryght walkyng in the law, was also Godly,
named Ananias, of whom all the Jews that dwelt than at Damasco reported well.
This Ananias standing by me, said thus. Brother Saul receive thy sight
again. And I forthwith received my sight and saw him.

Than said he: The God of our fathers has chosen, and ordained the for this
end, that thou should know his will, and that thou should see him, that
is only just: which iustifyeth all thing, and that thou should hear the
voice of his mouth. For Jesus was in the same light, that daseled thine iyes,
and it was his voice that thou dyddest here, forbecause thou shalt be a
wytnes unto him before all men, of those things, which thou have seen and
heard, and now seeing this is the will of god, wherefore do thou stay.
Arise, and be christened, and wash away thy sins, calling unto his name,
whom thou before have persecuted.

These things done at Damasco, when as I within short space after, had
returned unto Jerusalem, being than a new man, and was praying in the temple,
ravished I was besides my self, and Jesus I saw which said unto me: Make
haste, and get the spedely out of Jerusalem, for here will they not receive thy
testimony of me. Than answered I in this wise: Lord, I have a good hope, that
I shall do good among this people, forasmuch as themselves know, that I for
favor that I did bear unto the law cruelly handled thy disciples, halyng
into prison as many as I could take, and whyppyng them in all congregacions,
that gave credence unto thy gospel. And yet was I not satisfied with this
doing. But when the blood of Steven was shed, which by his death bare
faithful witness of the, and with great boldness and constancy, I also was by
when they stoned him, and consented to the death of the innocent man, insomuche
tha^. I kept their garments, which brought him to the place of execucion,
and that first began to cast stones at him. And seeing that every man may well
understand by this, how much affeccionate I was once toward the law, they
may now right well perceive that I changed not mine intent without great
causes, and many shall be found, that will so much the more gladly follow
mine ensample, the more they shall see that my zeal was toward this old
religion, for love whereof I the more cruelly persecuted thine. When I had this
said, the Lord answered: Go, I say, and do as I bid the, for now is time
come, that the spreadynge of my gospel all the world abroad were begun. And
for this end have I chosen the, that I may send the from hence to far
countries among the Gentyles.

The Jews had peaceably suffered Paul to speak his mind, until he spoke
those words, yt is (I will send the to far cou^treyes among the Gentiles.)
These words renewed eftsoon every man's grief, because that the Jews bear
great despite, and wunderfully abhorred the Gentiles: and for this cause
diverse of those also which despised not the gospel, would in no wise that
the Gentyles should have been made partakers of the gracious benefit that
rummeth by the gospel: or if they needs should be received, that than they
should not be received, unless they would be circumcised, as who should say,
that a man might not be a good man and in the favor of God, unless he were a
Jew. Wherefore when they heard that the Gentiles were preferred before the
inhabitauntes of Jerusalem, with great clamoure and noise they interrupted
Paul's tale, and said unto the marcyall: Rydde this fellow out of the world,
for it is pity that he lives. And when the Jews by many tokens, vttred the
outrageous grief of their minds, by crying, and castyng of their garments,
and finally by throwyng dust into the air, the marciall supposed that some
heinous crime had been committed, by occasion whereof, all the people thus was
stirred up after so strange a sort: specially seeing that through license
given by him unto Paul to tell his tale, there had come naught else, but more
inconvenience, commanded his soldiers to bring Paul into the castle, and by
way of examinacion to whyppe him, to the end that by that means at the least
wise, they might of his own confession, get out of him the cause, why the
people took up such exclamacion against him.

And whiles they at the commandment of the marcyall, were in byndynge him
toward his whyppynge, Paul said unto an under captain standing by, which
was appointed to see him examined with torments: What, is it a thing lawful
for you to whyppe a Romayne, yea, and that before he be cast or found guilty
of his trespace? Which words when the pette captain heard, he spedely went
unto the marciall, and showed him what he had heard, saying: what intend ye to
do? For this man, whom ye have commanded to be whypped, is a citizen of Rome.

But as soon as the marciall heard this, he came to Paul himself, and said
unto him: Tell me is that same true, that my petie captain has certified me
of? Art thou a citizen of Rome? And when Paul had affirmed that he was a
citizen of Rome, the marciall answered: It is a great matter that thou
speak of. For it cost me a great some of money, before I could be
franchised and made a citizen of Rome. Then said Paul: In this matter my
chance was better, for I was borne citizen of Rome, and that lawfullye, for my
parents before me were likewise. Than furthwith those which were ready there
to have gotten out the truth of him by mean of torments, departed from Paul.
And the marciall also himself feared of his own part, after that he
perceived him to be a citizen of Rome, because that he had bound him. So
greatly was the name of the Romans than feared.

The next day the captain being desirous to know what the matter was, that
the Jews had accused him, leused him out of his bands, and commanded that
the chief priests should assemble together, and all the whole council
likewise, and furthe brought he Paul before them, that the matter might be
entreated by the heads without commocion of the multitude.

The.xxiii. Chapter.

THan Paul having his iyes fixed and steadfastly set on ye council, begone to
speak in this wise: I have been conuersaunt in the sight of God, who only
gives rightful judgment, until this present day, beating my self vpryghtly
and with a good conscience, in all matters. When the high priest Ananias had
heard him so boldly speak, and so freely, how that straight ways he declared
and avouched himself to be gyltles, to the judges reprofe, and other his
accusers, taking the matter grievously, that he had not reverently spoken of
him, neither that he any thing cloked the matter, commanded those that stood
by, to buffet him on the face whiles he was speaking. This was it, that the
lord had certified Paul of before, when he said: They shall not receive thy
witness of me. Tha^ Paul on the one side disdeynyng in his mind at this
injury, which was never used, no not in the judgments of the heathen, and on
the other side certifyinge him that he should be punished at Gods hand
afterward in time to come for such manifest tira^ny, Sit thou and iudgest
me? etc.
said unto him: God shall smite the thou whitelymed wall. Syttest thou in this
wise, that when thou have heard the matter, thou may give sentence according
as the law requires, and commaundest thou me to be smitten before thou
hear the matter, contrary to the law? which forbyddeth that any man
should be punyshed, except he be lawfully convicted and cast. Than they
which stood next unto Paul, said unto him: Do thou in this wise reuyle
Gods high priest? To such extreme tyranny was than the priesthood of the
Jews come, that they claymed it as a thing lawful for them, against right
and equytie, to do every man hurt, and yet would not they permit other me^
freely to speak. Which was an evident token that their priesthood should not
long continue, after it was come to the extremity of all mischief. Than Paul,
perceiving that he should nothing further his cause under such a judge, thought
that best it was only to seek occasion, how that assembly might be dissolved.
Wherefore he aunswerd: Brethren I was uncertain that this man was the high
priest. Else I remember well, that it is written in the book of Exodus: Thou
shalt not speak evil by the Prince or rewler of the people. After he had
with this answer, somewhat appeased these that warned him thereof, he
ymagined some occasion, how he might avoid the tumulte and murmouring of the
people. For lawful it is to void peril by craft, whereas appears no hope of
profityng.

Wherefore Paul, considering that in the congregation there were two sorts of
men, the one Sadduceis, the other Phariseis, which agreed not one with an
other, said with a loud voice in audience of the counsel, so that every man
might here him: Brethren I am a Pharisey, and my parents were Phariseis, and I
am arrayned, for because that I preach, that the dead shall arise again. After
he had thus said, there arose dyssencion between the Phariseis, and the
Sadduceis: And the multitude also that was present seeing them at variaunce,
varyed among themselves, and were of sundry opinions and parts. For the
Sadduceis, in as much as they believe that the soul dies with the body, do
neither allow resurreccion, nor suppose that there is any spirit or angel:
The Phariseis on the other part believe both that resurreccion shall be, and that
there be both Angels and spirits. Wherefore the multitude with great
clamor began to make trouble.

In the mean space, certain Scribes of the Phariseis sect, arose, and
contended in the favor of Paul, and said: We perceive nothing wherein this
man has transgressed. And if that the holy ghost or an angel has spoken
unto him, it is not our part to contend ne strive with God. This they said,
upon the occasion that Paul the day before, had showed the^, that the lord
had appeared unto him by a vision in the temple. So much does it avail in
cases alredye r^wled and determined, to be of this sect, or of that. But when
this dyssencion increased more and more by reason that the Sadduceis cried out
so sore against the Phariseis, and the matter seamed like to grow to nothing
else, but to an extreme and deadly commocion, the marciall fearing lest that
Paul should be plucked in pieces among them, commanded the soldiers to go
down, and take Paul from the throng, and to bring him into the castle again.

Than was it time, that God should somewhat coumforte him, that so manfully
had wrastled for him, seeing that these troubles were so sore, and yet sorer were
at hand. Wherefore the next night again, the Lord stood by him, saying: Be
of good courage Paul. These troubles shall not make an end of the, for the time
of death is not yet come: but yet is it to come, that even as thou have
valiauntly borne witness of me at Jerusalem, so shalt thou witness of me at
Rome also. Thou have done thy part in this city, which is the chief in all
Iewry, it remains next that thou do the same in Rome, which is the head
city of all the world.

But as soon as it was day, certain Jews made a conspiracion, and cursed
them selves to the devil and to damnacion, if they did either eat or drink,
before they had slain Paul: so great malice had they conceived against him.
And it was no small noumbre, that had made this conspiracy, but they were
above fowertie. These persons went to the high priests and elders, and showed
them their entente and purpose, saying: We have most depely cursed our
selves, to be perpetually damned in hell, if we either eat or drink, before
we shall have slain Paul. Now must ye likewise put unto your helpyng hands
to the furtheraunce of our request, that we may the more easily bring to pass
that thing, which we are all desirous to do. Send ye word to the high
marciall, both in your names, and also in the name of the whole counsel, that
he bring Paul before you again, pretendynge that ye will inquire more
dilygently of him, forasmuch as yesterdaye ye could not, by reason of the
commocion. And we shall so provide, that he shall not come safely into the
castle again, as he yesterdaye did, but before he come to the place, where
the counsel shall be kept, we will be ready to slay him.

Which craftye train of so deadly daungier, after that a certain young
manne, neuewe unto Paul by his sisters side, had perceived, he thought the
matter would not be slepte, but forthwith entered into the castle, and vttred
unto Paul, the daungier that was at hand. When Paul knew of this he called
one of the under captains unto him, and said: Bring this young man unto the
marciall, for a certain matter he has to dysclose to him.

Than the Captain took the young manne, as he was desired to do, and led him
to the marciall, and said: That same fellow Paul, which is in hold, desired
me to bring this young man unto you, and said that he had a certain matter,
which he desired to talk with you of. Than the marciall took the young man by
the hand, and went aside with him, and asked: What is the matter that thou
would speak with me? He answered. The Jews have conspired the death of
Paul, and have thus agrred among themelues, that they will entreat you, to
bring Paul again before the council to morrow: under the pretense, that they
will more dilygently make inquiry of him, forasmuch as yesterday they could
not well say all that they would have said unto him. But they entende an
other matter. Wherefore ye had need to take heed, that ye do not unawares
grant them their desires. For they have laid their heads together and do
utterly purpose to destroy Paul, yea there be above fowerty, that have cursed
themselves depely, if they either eat or drink, before they have slain him.
And even now are they ready to commit this mischief, and look but for an
answer of you. When the marciall had heard this, he let the young man depart
chargeyng him, that he should tell no man, that he had uttered this matter
unto the marciall. For he was desirous to save Paul's life, but yet so, that he
might avoid the ill will of the Jews.

Wherefore he called two of his petie Captains unto him, and said: Make ye
ready of soldiers, two hundredth foot men, and three skore and ten horsemen,
and two hundredth spear men, that may go to Cesarea, soon upon the third
hour of the night: provide also horses, that ye may carry Paul safe to the
presydent Felyx: the cause of the marcyalles so priest dilygence, was not for
this only cause and purpose to save a man's life (for he was not a man of any
such conscience) but his desire was to be dyspatched of Paul whom he neither
could defend or maynteyne against the set malice of the whole counsel, nor
yet durst commit him being a citizen of Rome, unto their furiouse hands. And
therefore commanded he that he should be had forth away by night, with a great
bend of men, fearing lest that if he had gone in the day, or with a small
company, the Jews would have taken him away in his journey, and killed him:
and than the fault should have lain on his neck, because it would have been
thought, that he had betrayed a citizen of Rome. And he sent also a lettre
unto Felix, the tenor whereof follows. Claudius Lysias unto the most woorthye
president Felix, gretyng. The Jews had laid hands on this man, and would
have ^laine him, unless I, upon knowledge that he was a citizen of Rome, had
cummen with a bend of men, and taken him from them* And forasmuch as I was
desirous to know the cause wherefore they accused him. I brought him before
their own council. Whom I found to be cle^e without fault, either worthy
death, or else wherefore he had deserved to be emprysoned, saving that certain
questions of the Jews law were laid to his charge, but nothing else. As
soon as I was certifyed, that the Jews had appointed to lie in wait for him,
I sent him forthwith unto you, admonyshynge the Jews withal, which be his
accusers, that if they have any thing to lay to his charge, they should take
their journey to plead their matter before you. And thus fare ye well.

Than the soldiers, according as they were commanded of the marcial, being
charged with Paul, brought him by night to Antipatras the city.

The next day for as much as Cesa^ea was not far of, and they supposed then
that there was no great daungier to be feared, the footmen returned to
Jerusalem into the castle again, and the horsemen went with Paul unto
Cesarea. Whyther after they were come, and had delivered the letter unto the
presydent, they brought Paul also before him. And when the presydente had
perused the letters, he asked Paul of what prouynce he was. When Paul answered
that he was a Cilician borne: I will hear the, (said he,) when thy accusers
are present. And so commanded that he should be kept in Herodes judgment
hall.

The.xxiiii. Chapter.

THan within five days after, Ananias which was than the high priest, and
certain other, elders, came down to Cesarea: having in their train a
certain orator named Tertullus, which should plead this matter. So
earnestly were they set to slay Paul. Which men after they had spoken with the
presidente, and had required that the prisoner might be brought forth, Felix
commanded Paul to be called forth to appear.

Than Tertullus, being but a s^endre and a base defendour or protector of an
evil cause, began in this wise to accuse Paul: Where as we may thank you
that all matiers have been quiet and peaceable emonge us this long space, and
many diverse and soondry things are right well governed in our common weal
by your wisdom, we at all times and in all places knowelege and set forth
this your goodness toward us, most noble captain Felix, and now therefore,
do tender unto you most herty thanks.

And this your redynes of right gentle heart toward our nation, puts us in
great hope and confidence, that ye will consydre the tranquillity of our
country, as concerning this cause also, which we now bring before you. But
lest that I should retain, and keep you away from your soondry and weighty
effayres with over long a process or cyrcumstaunce of words, I shall desire
you, as your accustomed gentilnesse is, to here us speak our minds in few
words. We have perceived this manne to be a deadly enemy to our country,
for as much as he has set debate between the Jews, not only those that
inhabit Siria, but the others also in all countries through the world,
wheresoever is any resort of Jews, making himself the brynger in of a new
sect, which is called the Nazarenes. And not contented with this, he was not
afraid to come to Jerusalem, and bryngyng into the temple men that were not
circumcised, sticked not to profane and suspende our temple, who^ we took
with the deed doing, and would have judged according to our law, but Lisias the
high marciall, came with a great band of men, and took him out of our hands,
leauyng the examynacion of the matter unto you, and willed his accusers to come
before you: so that the marciall himself can testifye unto you, that these
matiers are true, which we lay to his charge. In this wise this slender and
liyng orator said: and the Jews that were present at this accusacion,
affyrmed that it was even so, as Tertullus had said.

Than after this Paul when the presidente by his be^kenyng had willed him to
make answer for himself, began to defend his own part in this wise: I shall
with a great deal the more quiet mind answer for my self, for as much as I
know that ye have been of many years enbuisied among this people: and that by
reason of decisyng matiers belongyng to the Jews, ye are not ygnoraunt of our
laws. And the later that this matter has been do^n whereof these men accuse
me, so much the more certaynlye may ye, by inquiry, know it, for it is yet
but twelve days since that I according to the custom of the Iewyshe
relygion, came up to Jerusalem, there to make my prayers, and to purify my
self, after I had taken on me a vow according to the solemn manier and
fashion of the Jews. If ye call this violatyng or pollutyng of the temple, I
knowledge my fault and offense. Neither found they me in the temple disputyng
with any man, neither making ye people to flock together, no nor in the
Sinagoges, nor yet in any place of the city. Neither can they dewlye prove by
any reason, such faults as they lay unto my charge.

As for that poyncte which they lay unto me, concerning the sect of the
Nazarenes, I will not deny that that is true. And yet mine accusers have
nothing to do therewith, for so much as the Jews have not condemned that sect,
and again I am not the autour thereof. But if ye be desirous to hear what
sect I profess, I will show you: I do according to the tradicion of ye
Pharisees, and their sect, wourship the God, that is commonly wurshipped in my
country, and am not autour of any new religion, but keep those things, that I
have received of my forefathers dylygentlye, beleuynge all things to be true,
Beleuyng all things which are written in ye law and the prophets.
that are written in the law, and in the prophets, which things al for the
most pa^te, inasmuche as god, like as he promised, has now fulfilled, I do
fully believe that those things also will cum to pass* which he has promised
for to cum, that is to say, that the dead shall rise again in time to cum, as
well the badde as the good: the good to receive gloriously life everlasting,
the badde to everlasting punishment. These things am not I in a waueryng
belefe of, but so earnestly I am persuaded in the^, that for as much as I know
that in time to cumme, I shall appear before god in ye place of judgment, and
shall be rewarded according to my deeds, I endeavor my self earnestly, so to
live, that I in nothing offend the law of God: but that I may have a pure and
a clear conscience, not only in the sight of god, which examyneth man's heart,
but also in the sight of man. And this have I dyligently observed and followed,
even until this day. And therefore have they nothing whereof to accuse me as
touching my life that is past, whereby that such matiers as they lay unto my
charge, may appear the more probably to be true.

For when I had lived vprighte without fault many years, at the last came I
to Jerusalem, there to make delivery of certain money which I had gathered in
Asia, to help the poor and nedye folks in my country. If this be the part
of a malefactor for to help my poor countrymen, bestowyng on them my
benefit, I will acknowledge that, that they lay to my charge. And in the
mean time, lest that they, which sought occasion, might make any trouble or
business, I shaued my head, and so went into the temple, and was purified
with accustomed ceremonies, doing nothing whereby any trouble or business
might arise. For I began no new thing, but the same ceremonies used I, that
all the whole country uses. Buth the commocion that was made, was raised up
by certain Jews of Asia, whom it had been expedient to have been present at
the debating and trial hereof, forasmuch as they are the workers of this
matter, and that they should accuse me if they had any thing to lay to my
charge.

But it is a great suspeccion, that they have small confidence in their cause
forasmuch as they absent themselves from this judgment, perceiuyng that the
matter is pleaded before you which are the presidente here. If I had offended,
I might have been convicted by the^, or else quitte by them. Albeit I fear no man, what ever he be that accuses me. Yea let them themselves which are
here present, speak: seeing that I stand here before the counsel, if they have
seen me do any thing otherwise, then is lawful before god, and standing with
the law. For it is lawful where judgment is kept according to the law, both
for the plaintie to lay to the charge of the transgressour, and for the
defendau^t to be his own man of law, or proctoure.

But I know they have nothing against me, except they will lay these words
in my teathe, which I with a loud voice spoke: that I was a Pharisee, and
that I was for this poinct accused, because I preached resurreccion of ye dead,
again unto life: which words I said, forasmuch as standing as I did among
them, and permitted of the marcial to utter my mind, I saw nothing done
vpryghtly by law, but all to pass upon plain hatred and malice. And when I
had so said, they contended between themselves, until that the marciall took
me out of their hands. I spoke nothing but the truth, and mete it was that
the multitude should know wherefore I was endaungered before the counsel:
forasmuch as I saw there was no help to be looked for, at the hands of the
chief rewlers.

When Felix had heard this, because he was well acquainted with the sect of
the Pharisees which Paul professed, he minded to defer the examynacion of
the matier, until an other time, and said: Forasmuch as Lisias knows all this whole matier how it stands, when he cummeth hither, I will hear you.
And than gave he commandment unto his under captain, that he should in the
mean season keep him in ward, but yet so, that he might be gentely ordered,
and that he might diverse times be at ly^ertye, and that his familiars might
freely repair unto him, and bring him such things as he lacked.

And when a good sort of days were past, Felix came to Cesarea with his wife
Drusilla, which was a Jew borne, and than sent he for Paul, being desirous
to have farther knowledge of him, as concerning ye sect that he professed. Than
Paul opened unto him the way to salvation by ye gospel, which thing he before
had not spoken of, and how that salvation was not obtained by observing of
Moses law, as the Jews supposed, but by beleuynge in Jesus Christ, whom
being so many hundredth years looked for, the Jews had cru^yfied: and that by
baptism, all sins committed by the whole time and course of man's life
before, were at once washed away, so that such as were regenerate in Christ,
should live sincerely and holyly, according to the rewle of the ghospel, from
thence forth, until such time that the same Jesus, which has given himself
for the redemption of man, did gloriously return in sight of all men, with
the power of his father, to judge the quick and the dead. When as Paul had
talked on this wise at large of such matters as these be, that is to wete, of
the gracious favor of god, that man cummeth to through faith: of euangelical
iusticie, of temperaunce, and sobernes of the spiritual life, and of the latter
judgment, that no man could escape. Felix was afraid, and somuche moved
therewith, not that he forthwith did acquit Paul (for he feared the Jews,
whom he knew did deadly hate him) but that Paul was for the mean space kept
in hold after a gentle ^orte, until that he might have occasion to deliver
him.

There was an other matter also, that caused him not straight ways to quitte
him, for he trusted that Paul would give him some ready money, that he might
be delivered. And for this cause did he often send for Paul, and commoned
with him, that he might give him occasion to profer him money, that he upon
famyliar acquayntaunce and gentle entertaynement of ye president, might put
away shamefastenes, which he thought did stay Paul, that he durst not
profer money. For the Emperors laws do punyshe the judge, that suffers a
malefaciour to escape by brybery. In the mean time, when Paul continued two
years at Cesarea, the Emperor Aero sent a certain man named Porcius Festus
to succeed Felix in the room. And than had he a good occasion to dimisse Paul.
But he thought he would not depart from his prouynce with men's
displeasures, and willing rather to show ye Jews a pleasure, then with an
vpryght conscience to deliver an innocent, he left Paul bound. So hard a
matter it is for the great men and rewlers of the world, to behave themselves
in all matters vpryghtly.

The.xxv. Chapter.

WIthin three days after Festus came to his prouynce, he went from Cesarea to
Jerusalem. But when the Jews heard tell yt a new president was cum, their
malice was newely kyndled again. For byanby the high pryestes and chief
rewlers of the Jews came unto him and desired his favor ye it might please
him to send for Paul to Jerusalem, forasmuch as it was not so commodious to
have ye matter pleaded at Cesarea. For they trusted, that ye president (which,
by reason that he late came into that province, was ignorant of those things,
yt had been done) would soon in this so small a matter show the^ favor. And
they la^ed await for him on the way to kill him.
But the Jews were at this p^ynete, that if Festus had granted the^ their
request they would have laid watch, and have slain Paul by the way. But
Festus being more indyfferent then they would he should have been, made
answer: yt Paul should remain in custody at Cesarea, and that he within few
days, would repair thither, and hear their matter. Wherefore said he, if
there be any among you that be mete men to follow this matter, leate the^ go
with me down to Cesarea, there shall he be arrayned before you. And if this man
that you speak of, be guilty, they may accuse him.

And when he had continued there among the^ more then ten days, he went to
Cesarea. And the next day he sat in the place of Judgment, and commanded
Paul to be brought before him. And after that he was brought forth, the Jews,
which came from Jerusalem, stood round about him, laiyng many and sore
matters to his charge, but none of them were they hable to prove: for Paul
answered for himself, and evidently declared, that he had neither offeded the
Jews law, forasmuch as he had diligently kept it, neither yet had profaned
or suspended the church, seeing that he had purely and peaceablye been
conuersaunt therein, nor had offended against themperoure at any time.

But when Festus perceived on the one part the innocence of Paul, and on the
other, the hatred that the Jews bare against Paul, which never would be
satisfied, endeuouryng himself so to gratifye the Jews, that he might seem
yet to do the party which was accused no wrong, said unto Paul: wylt thou
go to Jerusalem and there be judged before me? For he supposed that this would
please the Jews well, forasmuch as it was their own request before: Than
Paul being assured of thyntent of the Jews, made answer: I see no cause
wherefore this matter should be dyfferred until an other time, for there is no
let, but that even here I may be either quit, or cast: I am attained now at
the bar before themperours officer, in this city of Cesarea, and here needs
must I receive my judgment. I have done the Jews no hurt or iniurye, as you
your self know right well. But if that I have noied them in any thing, or
have committed any thing whereby I have deserved death, I am well content to
dye. But if all those things, which these men have laid to my charge, be
false, it is not the part of a Judge contrary to right and justice, to
permit them to handle me, according as they of conceived malice and hatred,
would desire to do. For the judge can not for favor of any person, condemn
a man that is attained, and I appeal to themperoure. Than Festus after that he
had communicacion with the council of the Jews, made answer unto Paul. Seeing
that thou have appealed to the Emperor, to the Emperor shalt thou go. For
the Jews were better content ye Paul should be sent to themperoure, then
that he should be quit: for they trusted that some thing would chance whereby
they at the last might ryd him out of the way.

In the mean space within a few days, king Agrippa, which had succeeded
Herod his father in the kingdom, whom the Aungel of god had stricken, came to
Cesarea with his wife Bernice, to salute and to welcome the new presydent
Festus. And when they had continued there a good sort of days, Festus by
occasion rehearsed unto the king, Paul's matter, in this wise: Felix which was
my predecessor, has left here a certain man in hold, whom the high priests
and chief rewlers of the Jews complained on, when I was at Jerusalem, and
defired me for their sakes to give sentence against him. Unto whom I made
answer, ye the Romans were not accustomed to give sentence of death on any
man for favor of any person, before that his accusers appeared, and gave
sufficient evidence against him, and he had liberty to answer to such things,
as should be laid against him. And so when his accusers were cumme hither,
I without any delay, sat the next day in judgment, and wylled the prisoner
that was accused, to appear before me. And when as his accusers came forth,
they laid no such matters to his charge, as I thought they would have done,
but certain questions demanded they of him, concerning their own
supersticion, and laid to his charge, that he should affirm one Jesus,
which was dead, to be arisen from death to life again, and that he also is now
alive. But I perceiuyng that it was the least part of mine office, to make
inquiry of such questions, neither well knowing what I might say in ye matter,
asked him whether that he were willing to go to Jerusalem* and there to stand
to judgment, as concerning those things that were laid unto him, forasmuch
as the priests, Scribes and Phariseis, knew better how the matter stood, then
I. But when as Paul had refused that, and appealed to Caesar, in will to be
arrained before him, I commanded yt he in the mean space should be kept in
custody, until such time ye I might have occasion to send him to Caesar.

When Agrippa had heard this, he said unto Festus: I have of late heard much
speaking of that same Jesus, and of his disciples, and therefore would I my self
hear that fellow before he go to Caesar. Than said Festus: To morrow shall
you hear him. The next day, after yt Agrippa and his wife Bernice had with
much pomp and a great train, entered with the captains and the chief of the
city into the common hall, Festus commanded Paul to be brought before him.
Than Festus, jest yt he should seem to have brought forth Paul only to get
favor of the king, spoke in this wise: king Agrippa, and you all that are here
present, ye se the man, whom all the Jews have complained on to me, as well at
Jerusalem, as here also in this city, and have with great clamor cried, that
it was pity of his life. But I have made inquiry, and can not see that he
has any way deserved death. Albeit forasmuch as he has of his own free
will appealed to the Emperor, I am in full mind to send him thither. And yet I
cannot well tell, what I may certifye unto his majesty in writing. Wherefore I
have here brought him forth before you, and especially before you, king
Agrippa, that we may examyne him, and to have sumwhat to write. For me thinks
it stands with no reason, to send a prisoner and not to show withal what is
laid to his charge.

The.xxvi. Chapter.

THen king Agryppa turned himself to Paul, who stood before him bound, and
said: Thou have pardon to speak for thy self, if thou have any thing to say
in thine own defense. And forthwith Paul holdyng up his hand, began to
defend himself in this wise: It makes not a litell matter in my opinion, O
king Agrippa, before what judge, a man that is indicted, pleads his cause.
For he whose confidence is wholly in his own innocence, desires nothing more,
then to have such a judge, that either knows his cause very well already, or
else can soon perceive it. For if the judge be ignorant of the matter, he
that pleads it, shall in vain go about to set it forth in fine painted
terms. And therefore, although the Jews have laid diverse trespaces to my
charge, yet I think my self happy for this cause, that I shall this day
plead this matter before you, which know right well the customs, and order,
and also the doubtful questions and points that concern the law of the
Jews. Wherefore I will desire you to hear me patiently.

First and formoste whereas they lay unto my charge, that I have trespaced
against the law, how false that is, al my whole life, which I have hitherto
led shall declare. For although I was borne at Tarsus, yet have I even from my
chyldehode been brought up among the Jews at Jerusalem, where I diligently
applied the law at the feet of Gamaliel. So that the Jews know well enough,
how syncerely and godly I did led my life among my country men, and in the
most royal city, for they knew me many years ago, sense yt I was first
conuersaunt at Iierusalem, if they would speak, as they know it to be true in
deed. For I did not only keep the Jews religion dilygently, but I professed
that sect also which excels the rest, both in obseruinge the religion,
and also in most perfect knowledge of the law: that is to say, the sect of
the Phariseis. And it is a thing done without al shame, to accuse me that I am
not a Jew, seeing that I was, and even yet at this present also am a Pharisee
by profession, as who say, yt any man could deny him to be a Jew, that is
borne at Jerusalem. For among the Jews, ye sect of the Phariseis especially
does believe, that the bodies shall arise again, and that every manne shall be
rewarded according to his living and deeds that he did here in this world.
Neither have I at any time, shronken from the Phariseis sect: for even now am
I here artayned, because I believe that they shall be in a great felicity* that
have here lived well, according as god made promise to our forefathers.

But if it be a fault to look for that, that god promised to them that
wurship him, not I only, but many one more than I, are in the same fault. For
why do the twelve trybes of our country wurship god day and night, but only
for because they trust ye they shall come to this bliss, which he has
promised? And therefore scarcely is he worthy to be called a Jew, which
trusts not to that, that god has promised. And yet, O king Agrippa, for this
cause chiefly that I so believe, I am now endicted here of the Jews.

I know many will think it a thing impossible, if a man should affirm that
the body, when it is once dead and putrified, should arise again. But many
things seem to men impossible, which afterward yet they find true. If a man should say ye one manne might raise an other from death to life, he
might justly seem to speak a thing impossible, and y^ not without a cause.

But wherefore should you think it impossible, that god, which is hable to
do whatsoever shall please him, should raise the dead to life again? Can not
he, which gave every manne life, restore to life whom shall please him? Shall
we think him to be a liar, or breakyng promise in that which he has made?
Yea I my self have supposed things to be impossible which I afterward
proved true: and things to be contrary to our law, and ungodly, which I
tried afterward to be the principal points of perfeict godlynes and
religyon. In somuche, that once I was of the same mind toward the discyples
of Jesus of Nazareth, that the Jews are now toward me: for I stryued with all
my power against thaduau^cing of his name, and thought that I did wonderful
godly, when that I persecuted those, that professed him, to the uttermost y^ I
could: and so did I even at Jerusalem. For many holy men did I cast into
prison, having a commission of the high Priests so to do, and pronounced ye
sentence of death against them, when they should suffer. And I punyshed the^
not only at Jerusalem, but in all Sinagogues, whersoeuer I could hear of the^
in any assembly, purposing earnestly to bring them by veracion, once to such a
point, as to make them to speak in dispite of that most blessed name like as
I my self did in those days. Neither was I thus contented, but more madly
raged against them, insomuche that I rode to foreign cities, and such as were
far from Jerusalem, to thentent that I might punyshe such as professed his
name. And upon a time when I was most set and bent to this cruel business,
which I did not yet of malice, but only of zele that I bare to the law of my
country, and in this mind took my journey toward Damasco, being supported
with authority of the high priests, eue^ at mydde day, O king Agrippa, I saw
a certain light, which was much clerer then the brightness of the Sun,
suddenly to shine from heaven. And it shyned round about me, and those that
were with me.

When we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and
saying in the Hebrewe tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard
for the to kycke against the pryches. And I said: who art thou lord? And he
said: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest, but rise and stand upon thy feet:
For I have appeared unto the for this purpose, to make the a ministre, and a
witness of these things, which thou have seen, and of those things in the
which I will appear unto the, delyueryng the from the people, and from the
Gentiles, unto whom now I send the, to open their iyes, that they may be
turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, yt they
may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them, which are
sanctified by faith that is toward me. And when we all, being amassed by reason
of the brightness of the light, had fallen down on the ground, I heard a
voice speak unto me, that said in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why do
thou persecute me? It is hard for the to wynche against the prycke. Than
answered I: what art thou lord? Than spoke he again, and said: I am Jesus
of Nazareth whom thou persecutest. But arise, and stand up on thy feet.
Therefore have I stricken the down, Unto who^ now I send the to open their eyes.
being a persecutour, that I may set the on thy feet again, a preacher of my
name. For I have now appeared unto the to this end, that being chosen by me,
thou may bear witness of me, and execute such things, as thou have seen,
and others that I hereafter by vision, shall show unto the. In all which
things will I be thy defendoure, and deliver the from the people, and from
the barbarous nations of the heathen that be far of, whither I will now send
the in legate, that like as thou art, by delyuerau^ce of thine error made of a
blind man, perfect in sight: so thou may by preachinge the true word of
my gospel, open their iyes, that from sin and ignorance, which they have
been hitherto holden withal, they likewise may be converted to the light of
my gospel: and that such as have been heretofore given to ydolatrie, and by
reason thereof have become subjects unto Satan, may be made the servants of
god, who is lord of all things: and they that hitherto have been defiled with all kind of fylthinesse, now through faith and credence giving to my gospel,
may freely obtain remission of all sins: and such as hitherto have been
called not an elect people, but separated from God, and divided from all the
company of good men, may now have part among them that be sanctified, not
by circumcision, or observing of the law, but by beleuynge in me, and because
they give credence to my gospel. For there is now none other way remaining
whereby man may be sanctified.

These things, king Agrippa, were not done either in the night time, or in
any dream, but when it was broad day, many of us saw the clerenesse of the
light, and heard the voice distynctlye speaking. Wherefore I being assured that
this was done of god from heaven, was not dysobediente to the heavenly vision,
but lettyng pass the business that I had than taken in hand, by authority
of the high priests, I took a clean contrary way, thynkyng it more
expedient and necessary, to put in execucion that god commanded me, then that
the high priests had wylled.

For forth with I preached the gospel at Damasco, and than at Jerusalem,
afterward throughout all the parts of Iewrye: and to be short, among
diverse nations of countries being far a sunder, wyllyng them to repent
their life paste, and that they should turn from dumme Idolles, to the true
and living God: and that after they were once baptized, they should work from
thencefoorth such works, as became such persons as earnestly has repented.
For this cause the Jews, when they saw me in the temple, took me, and would
have slain me. Neither have I hitherto defended me with weapon, and yet by the
aid of God, at whose commandment I do this that I do, I am yet alive,
testifying to both great and small, those things that I was commanded to
preach to all men without respect of any person, feynynge no new doctrine of
mine own head, but preaching only those things, that Moses and the
Prophets affirmed should cum to pass. For the Jews also had wont to dyspute
in this wise of Christ by the prophecies of the Prophets, whether that
Messiah should cum, as a man subject to misery and death, or whether he first
should begin to raise the dead to life, and whether that he should preach
the true light, first to the Israelites, and after to the Gentyles. Which
things euery^hone, forasmuch as they were spoken of before by the Prophets,
and by Moses himself of Messiah, I preach, that we must look for none
other Messiah, for why* All these things are fulfilled in Jesus of Nazareth:
and nothing now remains, but that all men through penance and purity of
life prepare themselves against his cummynge, when he shall cum to judge all
the whole world.

When as Paul had spoken this and much more in his own defense, Festus,
which could nothing skylle of the Jews religion, estemynge all as dotage,
that he had spoken of his visyon, and of the arysynge again of the dead, said
with a loud voice: Thou dotest Paul. It is so with the as it often chances
to other men. Much knowledge in learning has taken thy right mind clean from
the. Paul answered: I dote not most noble Festus. For dotynge is called, when
a man through error of his mind, swerueth from reason. But I am sober, and
speak as the truth is, the which truth to know, is veraye wit in deed.
And that these things are so, it is not unknown to the king, before whom I
do much the more frankely talk of these matters, For this thing was not done
in a corner.
because I suppose, that he is ignorante in none of these points, that I have
spoken. For this thing was not dooen in a corner, but openly, and the rumor of
it was sparsed throughout all Iewry. Than Paul turned himself to Agrippa, and
said: O king Agrippa, believe ye the Prophets to be true? I know ye do
believe them. And he that believes them, cannot chose but believe the gospel,
which shows that it is cum to pass, that the Prophets said should cum.
Than Agrippa breakyng his communicacion, said unto Paul: Thou do sumwhat
persuade me to becum a Christen man. Than said Paul: veraily I would wyshe of
God with all my heart, that ye should believe, not only sumwhat, but
thoroughly: and not your self only, but also that all men, that hear me this
day, should be like me, this thing only excepted, that I would not wyshe any
of them to be thus in bands as I am.

When Paul had this said, the king, the presydent, and Bernice, arose, and all
the other that late there by. And when they had gone aside to common of the
matter, they agreed every man in this opinion that they said that Paul has
committed nothing worthy death, ne yet of imprisonment. Wherefore it had cum to
pass, that Paul had been dimissed, had not king Agrippa said unto the
president Festus, this man might have been quytte, if he had not appealed unto
the Emperor.

The.xxvii. Chapter.

ANd after that king Agrippa had given such sentence, that even as Paul had
appealed to the Emperor, so should he go into Italy, they delivered Paul,
and with him certain other prisoners in hands, unto ye under captain of the
Emperors soldiers, named Julius. And tha^ entered we into a ship, which
came from Hadramicium, a city of Affrike, which should set us up in Asia the
less, forasmuch as her journey lay by the coasts of Asia, at what time
Aristarchus out of Macedonia, a Thessalonian borne, continued with us, and
would needs bear us company in our journey. And so the next day after we had
leused from Cesarea, we arrived at Sydon. There the captain Julius, forasmuch
as he intended to handle Paul gentilly, permitted him to go out of the ship,
and to go visit his friends if he had any in Sidon, to the end that he might
the better be refreshed of them. And wha^ we had leused thence also, we
adue^tured not into the maigne sea, but took the left hand, and shored by the
sides of Cypres, for because that the wind was against us. After we had passed
over the sea, which is right against Cilicia and Pamphilia, we came to Myra,
which stands on the sea side in Licia.

And there the under captain found a ship of Alexandria ready, that sailed
into Italy, and he put us therein. And when we had sailed slowely many days,
and scarce were cum over against Guydon (because the wind withstode us) we
sailed hard by the coasts of Candie, over against Salmon, and with much work
sailed beyond it, and came unto a place which is called the fair havens: nygh
whereunto was the city of Lasca. When much time was spe^te, and when sailing
was now ieopardouse, because also that they had over long fasted, Paul put
them in remembrance, and said unto them: Syrs, I perceive that this vyage
will be with hurt and much damage, not of the ladyng and ship only, but
also of our lives. Nevertheless the vndercaptayne believed the gouernoure and
the master of the ship, more then those things which were spoken of Paul. And
because the haven was not commodiouse to winter in, many took council to
depart thence, if by any means they might reach to Phenice, and there to
winter: which is an haven of Candie, and lies toward the Southwest and
Northwest wind. When the Southwynde blewe, they supposyng to obtain their
purpose, leused unto Asson. And sa^led past all Candie. There met the captain
with an other ship, which had cum from Alexandria, a city of Egypt, and
was ready to sail into Italye, and shyfted us into the same. And after that we
had sailed many days slowly, and scarcely at the last were cum right against
Guidus, by reason that the wind was against us, we turned to the Ylande
Candie, nighe to a city of the fame Yla^de, which is sytuate on the very sea
bank, and is called Salmon, or (as sum men called it,) Sammonium. After we
had with much a do passed by Salmon, we came to an other haven of Candie,
that is called fair havens. This place was not far of from the city of Lasea.
And after that we had spent a long season in this nauigacion, or saylyng, Paul
perceiving that it was dangerous sailing, not only forbecause they could not
keep such course as they would have kept, by reason of the wind being against
them, but also because they had over long absteyned from meat, he admonished
and warned the mariners in this wise: Syrs I perceive that this saylynge will
be dangerous, and full of damage and peril, not only of the burden that is
in the ship and the ship it self likewise, but of our lives, wherefore we
were better cease from saylyng forward. But the captain gave ^are to the
master of the ship and to the Stern man, rather then to Paul's sayings. And
for as much as there was no convenient haven, where they might couch to lie at
rode being winter season, many were of this mind, that if they possyblie
could, they would sail as far as Phenice, which is an haven of Candie,
hangyng into the sea toward the Southwest, and Northwest wind. In the mean
time the South wind blewe, and they trusting that they might obtain their
purpose, and that they might reach to Phenice, leused from the sea coaste of
Asson, that is a city of Candye, and shored by the coasts of Candie.

But within a short space, there arose a sodeyne and boisterous wind which
the shyppemen fear most of all other wethers, and they call it a whyrle wind
and a pierrie. And the same, because it cummeth between the North and the east,
is called the Northeast wind. After this wind had taken the ship, and the
ship could not withstand the tempest, we let her go at al adventures whither
soever ye winds and waves would carry us. And when we were at the last brought
into a certain Yland which is on the south side of Candie, named Clauda, we
had much work to get a boat, whereby we might succor our selves, if any thing
chanced otherwise then well. And wha^ at the last we had drawn the boat up
into the ship, they used other polices to preserve the ship, for fear lest
that she chance to break by beatyng herself on the shalowes and flattes, they
girded the ship, about with ropes, they feared lest the wind should drive
them in to the Syrtes, Fearing lest they should fall into the Syrtes. etc.
which were certain flattes and quick sands not far from them south
ward, seeing that the pierie blew and drove that way, and therewith they let
down a certain vessel to stay the ship that she should not run so fast
forward. And by such means we being sumwhat helped, drove with the wind and
were carried forward.

But the tempeste still continuyng, when we had been tossed and waterbeaten very
daungerouslye, the next day they went to extreme shyftes, for they vnloded
the ship, and cast all into the sea, for to lyghten and sumwhat to ease the
ship. But when the tempest still continued the third day we cast away
over boorde with our own hands, the tacklyng of the ship. And forasmuch as
neither the Sun, ne yet the stars appeared for the space of many days, but
the tempeste still waxed more and more, every manne was in despair, and
looked for none other but death. And moreover by reason of this troublous
sailing, they had eaten no meat, of a long space. Tha^ Paul standing in the
mydle among them, said: Syrs ye should before have followed my council, when
I gave you warning, that ye should not leuse from the sea coaste of Candie. For
if ye had so done, ye had escaped this daungier, and also this loss of
goods. But forasmuch as that now cannot be undone again that is paste,
begin yet at the last to follow my council, and to wax wise. Be of good
chere, for not one of you shall peryshe. The ship only shall be lost. This is
no dream, that I speak, but the Angel of god, who^ I serve and wurshyppe,
stood by me this night and said: Paul be not afraied, thou shall not perish
here, but thou must first appear before Ceasar, and not only thou shall
escape safe, but God has heard thy prayers, and given unto the all these, that
are in ship with the: wherefore I say, be of good chere. For I doubt not, but
that it shall cum to pass, that god has promised by his Angel. And if ye
will know, how we shall escape safe with our lives, I will tell you: we shall be
cast up into a certain Yland, and there shall we be saved, but not without
shypwrecke.

But wha^ the fowerte^th night was cu^, (as we were sailyng in Adris, about
mydnight) the shypmen demed that there appeared some country unto them: and
sounded, and found it twenty ^adoms. And when they had go^ a little further they
sounded again, and found fiftene ^adoms. Then fearing lest they should have
fallen on some rock they cast four ankers out of the stern, and wished for
the day. As the shypmen were about to fly out of the ship (when they had let
down the boat into the sea, under a color as though they would have cast
ankers out of the foreshippe) Paul said unto the under captain and to the
soldiers: except these abide in the ship ye can not be safe. Then the
soldiers cut of the rope of the boat and let it fall away. And so when the
fourtenth night was cum well on, and we were saylyng in the sea, which was
called Adriaticum, the mariners lokyng forth about myddenight supposed that
they saw land. And being minded to prove, whether that they might safely
arryue thither, they let down a line with a plummet, which the shypmen call
in ye Greek tongue Bolis, because it is cast down into the water to sound: and
they found that it was twentye fadoms deep: than sailed we a little farther,
and they let down again the plummet and sounded, and found that it was
fiftene fadoms. And when they perceived, that it wexed shalower and shalower,
fearing lest they should hytte upon sharp rockye places, they cast four
ankers out of the stern, and wysshed for day, that they might certainly
perceive, what country it was, that appeared. Than ye mariners, having small
hope to save the ship, forasmuch as they perceived that they were not far
from land, they first thought to save themselves, and for that cause, they
let down a boat into the sea, feynyng and semblyng they went not about to
conueigh them selves away, but pretending that they would let down ye ankers
out of the foreparte of ye ship, because the tempest was great. But Paul
perceyuyng what they intended, and knowing that ye mariners could not be
missed, but must needs help to save the rest that were in the ship, warned the
under captain, saying: Except these men abide in the ship, ye can not be
saved. When the soldiers heard this word, they out with their swerdes, and
cut the ropes, that the boat hong by, and let fall into the sea.

But when the night by little and little vanyshed away, and day began to break,
Paul exhorted them all to eat sum meat, and said: It is now fowertene days
sense ye eat any thing, and ye are still fasting, wherefore I would council
you to take sum sustenaunce: for it is for your health so to do, lest that
when ye have escaped this tempest, ye be in danger for lack of food. For ye
must not think in your mind, what should we need to eat, seeing that we
shall straight ways dye? For this will I promise you, that not somuche as an
hear of any of your heads shall peryshe. When Paul had thus said, he
took bread in his hands, and gave thanks to god in syghte of them all, and
when he had broken it, after the ensample of Jesus the lord, than began he to
eat. And the others being than sumwhat revived, and encouraged, partly by
Paul's exhortacion, and partly by his ensample, began also to eat. We were in
noumbre in the ship, two hundred, threscore and syxtene. When they had taken
susteinaunce, they eased the ship, that she might approach nere unto the
land, and they cast out a great quantitye of wheat, which they had brought
out of Egypt toward Italye. For Egypt had been of long continuance, a sure
storer and furnysher of Rome, with wheat and other grain.

After yt it was day they saw land, but they knew not what country it was.
But they perceived, that it had a certain creek, by reason that the bank
stretched forth on both sides, into which creek, they purposed, if they
possiblye might, to drive the ship. And so they took, up the ankers, and
committed the^ selves to the sea, and leused withal the joints of the stern
and the rudder, to ye intent that they might use them also at their pleasure
and ease, to guide and to turn the ship whither they thought best. Then they
set up ye sail, and than they turned also the cross piece, whereupon the sail
hangs, to the wind, and having ye wind with them, hastened toward ye shore.
But when they could not ge^ into the creek as they had purposed, but by
violence of the wyndes were driven into a place ye hong a great way into the
sea, there they pytched in the ship. And ye fore part of the ship being
fastened in the ground, which was there shalowe, stood stiff, and the hinder
part leused asunder by violence of the waves. And than was there none other
remedy, but that every man should shift for himself, and swim forth.

Than the soldiers thought it best to kill the presoners, lest that any of
the^ when he had swimmed forth to land, should happen to run away, but the
captain was against this cruel and unmerciful counsel, being desirous to save
Paul, forasmuch as by his mean, they all had been preserved. And lest that any
one should perish, he commanded, ye such as could swymme well, should first
leap into the sea and swymme to land. And they that could not swim, should
partly take boordes and lie on them, and partly help themselves with other
instruments of the ship, and so to escape to land. By this mean at ye last
it came to pass, that every one came safe to land.

The.xxviii. Chapter.

ANd when they were gotten on land, they knew not what Yland it was, but
afterward they enquited of the inhabitours, and heard that it was called
Melite. The Same Melite is situate and lies between Epirus and Italy, toward
the north part of Sicile. Than the people thereof pietiyng our myschaunce,
entertained us very gentilly. For they made a great fire for us, and brought us
al together to it, being sore handled, what with meat and what with cold.
There came a vyper out of the heat and caught him by the hand.
And when Paul had gathered a great boundel of sticks, and had cast them on
the fire, a vyper, which before was even styffe for cold, and lay hydden
there, being stiered up with the heat, crept forth, and stynged the hand of
Paul. But the inhabitauntes of Melite seeing this venomous beast hangyng by the
styng at the hand of Paul, said: undoubtedly it must needs be true yt this
fellow is sum murderer: which though he have escaped ye daungier of the sea
being cast up by tempest, yet the vengeance of god suffers not him to
remain on live. But as soon as Paul perceived the vyper styng him, he cast
her of into the fire, and had no hurt at all. But the people that looked on
him, supposed it would cum to pass that ye poison would get through y^ veins
and that his body would straight way burn and swell, or that he would
suddenly fall down dead, the strength of the poison percyng furthwyth to the
heart. And when they had marked a great while to see what would becum of
Paul, and saw that he had no hurt by the stynging of the vyper, with like
lyghtnesse they eftfones changed their mind, and said that he was a God. For
the inhabitours of Melite had not yet heard the fame of Jesus, which gave
this to al them that professed his name, that no strength of poison, were it
never so extreme or deadly, might hurt them.

In the same quarters were lands of the chief man of y^ Isle (whose name was
Publius) which received us, and lodged us three days courteously. And it
fortuned that y^ father of this Publius, lay sick of a fever, and a blouddye
^^ix. To who^ Paul entered in and prayed, and lay his hands on him and healed
him. So, when this was done, others also which had diseases in the Isle, came
and were healed: which also did us great honor. And wha^ we departed they laded
us with such things as were necessary. And nere besides the shore where we
arrived, lay a lordshippe belonging to the chief man of the Isle, named
Publius, who received us into his house, and for the space of three days,
entertained us very gentilly. The same time Publius father was sick of an
agewe, and of a blouddye flixe, so sore, that he kept his bed. This Paul
having in mind the commandment of his master* came in to the dyseased
person, and when he had made his prayers to God, he laid his hands on him,
and healed him. Which thing after it was bruted abroad over all the land,
others likewise that were sick, came unto Paul, and were healed. Wherefore
they, as long as we continued there showed us much gentilnes, and when we made
ready our selves to depart, they brought into our ship all manner
necessaries.

And so wha^ we had continued three months in the Ylande, we got an other
ship of Alexandria, that all the winter had harbored in Melite. The baner of it
had painted on it Castor and Pollux, for their badge: whom the Grecians do
call Dioscuros, and suppose that they prosper those ye sail on the sea, when
they appear sitting ioyntlye together, the one by the other on the cross
pyece, whereunto the sail is fastened. When we had entered into the ship, we
leused from Melite. And after yt we arrived at Syracusa, a city of Sicilie
hard upon the sea, we tarried there three days. Than leused we from Syracusa,
and shoring about by the coasts of Sicilie we came to Rhegium, a city in ye
borders of Italy, situate and liyng within ye territory, that belongs to the
Brutians. From thence is but a small journey to Sicilie. For on that side both
Sicilie and Italy sumtime joined together, until such time that the vyolence
of the sea dyuyded the one country from the other, breakyng in betwyxte them
no more but a mile and an half, for which cause the Grecia^s called it
Rhegium. From thence a day after, it chanced us to have a good wind, that is
to say a sowthwinde, and so we sailed to a town called Puteoli. Where we
met with christen men which desired us to tarry there with them for a certain
space. Wherefore we satisfied their request, and remained there seven days, and
thence we went straight to Rome. And forasmuch as the brethren, that were at
Rome had heard that we were cummyng thither (for the name of Paul was very well
known among all the christen men, that were than at Rome, by reason that he had
written before ye time, an epistle unto them) certain of them came forth of the
city to a place that is there called Appii forum, and to a certain place,
called ye three rauernes, to mete us. And when Paul saw the^, he was much
coumforted, perceiuyng yt there also were sum, that hertily favored the
gospel: and geuyng god thanks, he took a bold heart with him, and hoped well.
And when we were cum to Rome, the under captain delivered the others that were
in bo^des, unto the chief captain of the army there. But Paul had liberty to
abid and remain at his liberty, saving only that he had one soldier to keep
him.

And forasmuch as he was brought to Rome in bands with others lest any^ of
the Jews should suppose that he was thus served for sum trespace after the
third day, he called together all the heads of the Jews ye were abydyng at
Rome, and spoke unto them in this wise.

Brethren (says he) whereas I have committed nothing against my countrymen,
or else against the tradicions of our forefathers, being cast in bands at
Jerusalem, I was delivered into the hands of ye Romans, who brought me into
Cesarea before the president Felix, afterward before Festus. Which after they
had examyned my matter, would have quitte me for as much as, eue^ as they
themselves granted, they found nothing in me worthy death. But when ye Jews
maliciously renou^ced and cried against me, I was compelled to appeal to
Caesar: not because that I am offended with my countrymen for this matter, or
yt I intend in like manner to accuse them of any thing before Caesar, and so
to increase ye hatred that he bears against them, but to defend mine own
innocence. For I wyshe well to all men, that with a pure heart wurshyp god,
according to the law of my country. And for this cause, bearing such good
affeccion and zele toward you, and yet by reason of these bands being in
such case ye I might not come unto you to visit you, I willed you to be sent
for, that with the sight of you and co^municacion withal, I might be somewhat
the more comforted. And why do the Israelites so earnestly wurshippe god,
despising the Idolles of the Gentiles, but because they trust at the fynall
resurrection to be rewarded for their good deeds? And for this hope, which all
my countreymenne, as well as I are in, am I now thus bound, as ye see, in
cheynes. And other fault can not they lay unto my charge.

Unto this the chief of the Jews answered in this wise: Where as thou
purgest thy self unto us, as though some man had accused the, be thou assured
that no man has so much as written a letter unto us from Iewrye concerning any
hurt done of thy part, neither has any man come from thence hither and
spoken any hurt of the. Yet are we desirous to hear thy mind, even of thine
own mouth. For as concerning this new sect of Jesus of Nazareth which arose
to life again, assured we are that every man constauntly cries out against
it, as a vain thing. Thou shall therefore do us a good pleasure if thou
enstruct us certaynlye what thy mind is therein. Which thing when Paul had
answered he would gladlye do, upon the day appointed, the Jews resorted
unto him again in his ynne where he tarried, mo then had cu^men unto him
before, unto whom he expounded the doctrine of the ghospel, witnessyng that the
kingdom of God was than come, and ye Messiah ought no longer to be looked for,
forasmuch as Jesus of Nazareth was he: and that he proved by the figures of
Moises law, and the foresaiynges of the prophets euydently expressyng, that
whatsoever was shadowed in the law, and spoken of before by Moses and the
prophets, was plainly and wholly fulfilled in in Jesus of Nazareth.

When Paul had very largely spoken of these matters, from morning until
euenyng, sum of the Jews believed the words of Paul, sum believed not.

And when they agred not among themselves, they departed, after ye Paul had
spoken one word: well spoke the holy ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our
fathers, saying: Go unto this people, and say: with your ears shall you
hear, and shall not understand: and with your iyes shall ye see, and not
perceive. For the heart of this people is wexed gross, and with their ears
have they had no lust to hear, and their iyes, have they closed, lest they
should see with their iyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with
their hertes, and should be converted, and I should heal the^. Be it known
therefore unto you, that this salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they
shall hear it. And when he said these words, the Jews departed from him, and
had great disputacions among the^ selves. And Paul dwelte two years full in his
lodgeyng, and received all that came in unto him. Preaching the kingdom of God,
and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus with all confidence,
no man forbyddyng him. And when they were at variaunce among themselves, they
began to depart, after Paul had once added unto his long sermon, a word or
two wherein he reproved their hardenesse of belefe, which could not find in
their hertes to believe so manifest testimonies of the law and prophets being
plainly fulfilled in Jesus. The holy ghost, said he, has well prophesied of
you by the prophet Esai, speaking unto our forefathers, whos^ stubberne
mysbelefe you resemble. Go, said he, unto this people, and say unto them:
With ears ye shall hear, and not understand: and with iyes shall ye see, and
not perceive. For the heart of this people is wexed gross, and they have had
with their ears no lust to hear, and their iyes have they closed, left they
should see, and hear with their ears, and perceive with their heart, and
should be converted, that I might heal them. Wherefore be you well assured, yt
this health, which is offered unto you of God by Jesus, shall be carried unto
the Gentyles, for as much as you do reiecte it. For he rejects it, that
believes it not, neither is any man apt to receive this favor, that believes
not the gospel. Unto you first is the gift of god declared. For so the lord
commanded: And ye ought chiefly to have believed, which professed the law and
the prophets, but ye keep your iyes closed, and shut up against all these
things, your ears stopped, and a heart hardened, still gaynesaying the evident
light of the truth of the gospel. But the Gentiles, which neither know God,
nor have the law or prophets, shall turn from their wourshyppyng of idols,
and through faith shall obtain this favor of God which ye refuse, being
freely proffered unto you. When Paul had spoken these words, the Jews
departed from him, being at great disputacio^ among themselves. And so
continued he by ye space of two years in the house that he had hired, ientylly
receiving al me^ that came to him, whether they were Jews, or uncircumcised,
preaching unto them the kingdom of god, and teaching with all boldness the
doctrine of the gospel, no man forbidding or letting him, alleging prophecies,
which were many years sense spoken of Jesus: conferryng his deeds, words and
promyses thereunto.
