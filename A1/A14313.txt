THE PILGRIM OF CASTEELE.

THE PILGRIM OF CASTEELE.
Upon the shore of Barselon, between the plankes of a Ship which had suffered
wrack; there appeared as if it had been a fardell of cloth covered with
weeds: which being perceived by some Fishermen, they took it into their
Bark, and carried it along the shore about the space of two Miles, where under
the shade of some Trees, they cleansed away the weeds and mud, and found that it
was a man in a trance, who was almost past sense, and without life. These
Fishers moved with compassion, with some branches cut from an old Oak,
kindled a fire, and he who had been so near the loosing of his Life, now
recovering it, let them know what Countriman he was, by his complaint:
discovered his admiration by his looks; and the feeling he had of the good,
which they had done him, by the desire which he had to acknowledge it. Nature
doing the accustomable office of a pitiful mother, sent his blood to restore
the more infeebled parts; and having brought him almost to his former strength,
he was about to have discovered himself: But not thinking it fit in so
strange a fortune, he concealed his birth and name: Only saying, that this Ship
suffering wrack in the sea, and ceazing of these plankes which the Waves had
cast upon the shore* he was two days floating amongst the billows of the Sea,
who sometimes pitiful and then again cruel, did bring him near, and
farther from the Land, until such time that the refluxe of the water
vanquishing the impetuositie of the tempest, he was cast upon the sands, where
the violence of the stroke having as it were plowed up his tomb, he thought
himself buried. His return he said was from Italy, and the occasion of his
voyage, the indulgences of the Iubile, which was while Clement the Eight sat
Bishop. And sighing much, amongst the broken speeches of his story, he let
them understand that he wanted a companion of his travels, of whom there was no
news to be had, as it seldom happens that those who do free us from bodily
misfortunes, can also ease those of the mind: So he rested this day within one
of their Cabens, while the cold night discending, all crowned with stars,
did impart unto mortal Creatures rest conformable unto the quality of their
lives, giving desires unto the poor, cares unto the rich, complaints unto the
sad, unto the contented sleep, and jealousy unto the amourous; In the midst
whereof, he heard a Lyra played upon, and according with a voice, which in
singing complained of a Shepherdesses cruelty. The Pilgrim who although he
were weary, was yet more amorous, and loved Music rather then rest, went out
of his Caben into a meadow, from whence seeing about a dozen Houses, and
amongst some Oziers, the Author of those plaints, He called him a great way
off: the other answered with fear, But the pale light of the Moon, which hid
under the mantle of a Cloud, beheld the secrets of the night, made him see
that it was a poor man, and without arms: he then showed him a little lower
a planke lying amongst reeds over a little Brook, unto which the
solitariness of the place, and silence of the night did give no subject of
murmuring: which when he had passed, they saluted one the other courteously,
especially, he which came (for strangers are always courteous out of necessity)
and sat down together upon the Grass.

Already had the Pilgrim informed himself of the name of this Village, of the
Lord thereof, and how far it was distant from Barcelon, when they unlooked
for, saw two men coming who in stead of saluting them presented two
Harquebushes to their faces, and a thousand fears in their hearts; The
stranger told them, that they could take nothing from him but his life which
he esteemed little, and six hours agone much less: the other said he was
the son of a Seaman between a Fisherman and a Pilate, and that all his goods
consisted in this his Instrument, with which he did charm his cares. The
Soldiers, did not witness any desire unto their clothes, because one was of
Canuas, and the other of course cloth; And there is no Robber who is not
liberal of that which is of no worth. But they entreated them to conduct them
unto the Village, which in regard of the incertainty of the way, they could not
find in a great time. The Fisherman told them that in recompense of their
courtesy, he would advise them not to go, forasmuch as the Inhabitants were a
warlike people, and did not willingly lodge men of their fashion: And that it
would be a thing impossible to escape from their hands if they were discovered;
because, that upon the sounding of the first Laram, all the other Villages would
answer them, from whence would come a multitude of Laborers, who with diverse
Arms would stop the passages, and they knew the ways so well, that there was
neither Brook, Tree, nor Rock, which they had not at their fingers ends. To
this counsel the Bandoleers replied, that they were not alone; but that there
was above Fifty in their troop, fighting under the colors of a Catalonian
Knight, who had been injured by another more mighty then he, in means and
Parents, although not in force, reason, nor courage: Hardly, had they ended
these words, when by the reflection of the stars, they saw the Arms of the
squadron and Captain, which they spoke of. And now being joined all together,
they lodged by force in diverse houses of this Village; The Pilgrim curious to
learn (a general inclination of all such as travail in foreign Countries)
mingled himself amongst the Soldiers no way disliking his company, but
contrariwise invited him to supper: after which the floor serving them for
Beds, they entertained one the other with discourse, until the slow morning
then at the end of February, rose out of the arms of her spouse; they knew
from the Pilgrim his Fortune, and he being desirous to learn from them the
cause of so evil an assured life, his feature and his understanding being very
agreeable unto them, one of them called Ramond, told it in this manner.

The History of Doricles.
IN this famous City, which with a wonderful greatness opposes Italy, and
astonisheth Afric; there was borne a Lady of noble Parentage, who having been
a firebrand unto her Country, had no small conformity with the Greek Helen:
her name was Florinda, her beauty heavenly, and her spirit divine* she having
attained unto years fit for Marriage, two Knights equal in youth, greatness of
means, and Noblenes of blood, did seek her Love, with like hope; but unlike
favor. Love, natural inclination, a simpathy of manners, or an influens of
the stars, did constrain Florinda to love Doricles, and to hate Filander,
who to shorten his way between hope and possession, and to prevent his rival,
demanded her in Marriage of her Parents, who would willingly have kept the
respect which they ought unto the intercessors and his merits, if they had not
found that Florinda had lost, when they gave knowledge of the husband, which
they propounded unto her; They loved her tenderly and would not constrain her
with rigor, but treating freely with Filander, they told him, that she would
not agree unto it, although they had persuaded her as masters, and commanded
as Parents. Filander augmenting his love by the disdain, informed himself of
the cause, and found that the love which Florinda bare unto Dorricles, was
cause of the disdain which she bare to him, presently did accuse in his
imagination revenge, and a resolution to remove out of the world, the obstacle
of his design; no whit respecting, the scandals, and the evil success which
so hardy an enterprise might bring, he armed himself with such company as he
thought good (as he who was not unprovided of friends nor wanted servants) at
such times as he thought he should find Dorricles at his Mistresses door, or
in the street by her house, who doubting of his riual^ design, always went
well accompanied and better armed, as he who did not think that he could
have a better friend then his Sword; And having caused a Ladder to be brought
upon the eve of a Feast unto her Garden wall, by that means to speak with
her, it happened that Filander coming into that street, and doing his
accustomable Office of a spy, heard that Florinda spoke unto Dorricles, and
gave him a Nosegay of Ieasuine which she had in her hand, with imbracings more
insupportable to him then favorable unto Dorricles: He charged those which
kept the gate, and began with them a cruel combat: Dorricles comes down, and
searching Filander in the midst of his enemies, wounds him and puts him to
flight; for a Lover favored, is as a gamster who wins, who in all hazards is
always master over the Fortune of his adversary. Dorricles goes away
victorious out of the street, Filanders Love (which he turned into disdain)
became by this encounter a mortal hatred. Then of either side they increased
their bands; the fire of their anger kindled all their Parents; and although
they every day spoke together as if they had no quarrel, they failed not to
sight every night when they met. In this scandal Dorricles lost the enjoying
of his Mistres, Filander her favor; she her renown, and their Parents their
honor; time increased the Love of the one, and the others hatred increased his
desire of revenge, and of the small pleasure which the two Lovers had, Filander
had lest, unto whom it seemed better in this business to rely upon his
industry, for the effecting whereof his force would be wanting.

Having then learned that Florinda was to take her pleasure at Sea in a Bark,
he hid two or three days before, a Brigantine in a creek not far from the
shore, in which he apparelled himself like a Turk, with some other of his
friends (for accomplices in amorous enterprises are seldom wanting) and with
necessary Rowers attends his Mistres: the Meuxin, which is the Tower where
the watch of Barcelon is kept, having discovered no enemies sail in all the
Sea. In the mean time the contented Florinda with her companions, was not gone
from the shore a League, when as the counterfeit Frigot hoysing sails, and
beating the water with her owers, inuesteth her Bark, the Mariners whereof
looking for nothing less then such a surprise, could not resolve either to
fly or to defend themselves; But contrariwise (as the fearful bird seeing
the proud Merlin come fiercely stooping upon her, is accustomed to attend her
with couched wings) acknowledging by the Turkey sails, the power of their
enemies which were upon them, quitted their owers; and fear (which with a
cold shiuering ran through all their veins) gave them no time to discern
their subtilty, finally they boorded them, and two or three of the disguised
Turks leaping into the Bark ravished away the new Hellen, who carried into the
Brigantine, saw herself in the arms of Filander. The counterfeit words of
these Pirates, who called him Amurat Raix, made those who remained free in the
Bark, believe that he was the author of this robbery, And seeing that they
took nothing but Florinda, they returned again to Barcelon, recounting the
disgrace in every street and place where they came, with more cries and tears
then words, which coming to the ears of her Parents, caused more grief in
them then can be told, principally in the sorrowful Mother, who bewailed her
loss with a passion more befitting her sex then a generous courage. The
Gennets in vain spurred up and down upon the Coast, But Filander (who had
brought Florinda into a private Garden house, having taken away his Turban, and
his Turkish disguise) declared unto her, that the incomparable force of his
love, had constrained him to have recourse unto this subtilty, did enjoy her
beauty with assurance, although she took Heaven, the Trees and the Fountains
to witness the violence which was used to her.

Of no less consideration was Dorricles his pain, who full of mortal sorrow,
was a thousand times upon the Sea side ready to imitate the despair of those
Nymphs which saw Europa ravished; nevertheless, as well to obliege unto him
his Mistresses parents, as to satisfy himself, he bought a Ship of an
Arrogonis, which had brought in Wheat, and lading it with Silks, Veluets and
other Merchandise gave his sails unto the wind, turning his prowe toward
Argiere, Sali, Morat, Fuchel, Mami, Xafer, and other Pirates, had at the same
time arrived at Thunnis, Bisert, and Tripoly, and separated their Galleys into
the neighbor Ports; Doricles enquireth amongst them of his Mistres, and of as
many others as he knew did rob upon the Coast of Spain. But when he met with
none who could tell him news of her, whom his rival inioyed with such
pleasure, he went to Constantinople, and from thence unto Cayre, and having
run along the Coast of the Kingdoms of Fez, Morocco, Tarndan, and Tafilet,
dispairing of ever finding her, whom he had so long time, and so vainly
sought, changed his Merchandise into Christian Slaves* and returning into
Spain, disimbarked at Ceute: while the deceived Doricles did thus run along
the Coast of Afric, a servant of Filanders, were it either out of some
displeasure which he had taken, or out of envy unto his happiness, discovered
all the proceeding unto the Justice of Barcelon, who in a night following
inuironeth the garden house, with maine force, and takes Filander then when
he least looked for it; The news and admiration, which his subtilty and
surprise caused in the City, moved the Citizens confusedly to see him pass
through the streets; through the midst of whom he was had to Prison, and the
sorrowful Maid (already made a woman against her will) was rendered unto her
Parents; the sentence was mortal, the opinion common, the approbation
general, and the process short. The scaffold was ready, Filander disposes
himself to dye, and made it appear, that he had the courage of a Knight, and
the soul of a Christian; Nevertheless the Viceroy, and the Bishop, interposing
their authority, assembled the Parents, and having mollified the nearest,
diswaded Filanders death, in respecting the honor which they might gain by
his life; So of two evils choosing the least, they had more care to the
reparation of their honor, then to the contentment of revenge; Thus they
changed the mourning which was already provided for Filander, into nuptial
habits, and the scaffold into a bed, where Florinda was given him in lawful
Marriage: but the same day that they gave hands with the contentment and
rejoicing of all the world, Doricles entered into the City, and unlooked for
appeared in the head of two hundred men, whom he had drawn out of Captivity,
upon whose Cassaques did shine in silver Brodery the Arms of Barcelon and
their restorer; His word was I love the King. The sight and entry of this
heroique Citizen, was exceedingly agreeable and dear unto the Barcelonians;
But the insupportable news of his riuals Marriage, with his Mistres was no
sooner come unto Doricles his ears, but all the City in arms were divided
into factions, and contrary parties. This suspended the Marriage for some
days, during which time it was remonstrated unto Doricles, that he could not
marry with Florinda without infamy. He answered that what he could not have,
ought not to be given to Filander, it being no way reasonable that this
deceiuer should gain by fraud, what he had lost by so much travel; and there
was no other means to accord him, but that Florinda should retire into a
Monastery. To this her Parents contradicted already contented with the
satisfaction of their Honor, and the aliance of their Son in Law, whose
Parents offered unto Doricles a beautiful Sister of Filanders in marriage; But
he unwilling thereunto, demanded Justice against Filander for his crime,
offering, that after he should be beheaded he would marry Florinda as widow
unto a Knight. This last offer was artificially agreed unto by Filanders and
Florinda's parents, who married them together, and when Doricles thought that
Filander had bin led unto Prison, and from thence unto Death, he was given to
understand, how he was pardoned, and the Marriage consummated. If his sorrow
were great it may be known by the effects, seeing it is now Twenty years
since, from these Pirenean mountains which divide France from Spain, he has
lived as an out Law, robbed, pilled, and ruyned all that he finds, neither
Kingdoms being able to take any revenge. He was One and twenty years old
when he came from Afric, he is now Forty one: a strong man, Vigorious of
his person, which is much fortified by his austere and wild life. And that may
be believed of him, which was said of Hercules, that without doubt he had
three lives, for if he had had but one, it had bin a miracle that he had not
lost it by so many wounds.

This day about Sun rising he came down to see what noise this was, which the
night before had sounded from the Sea unto the Woods, and he with about ten of
us which followed him having found some bords which the sea had cast up, upon
one of which was seated a Youngman in habit of a Pilgrim like thy self, pale,
in a trance, all drencht in water, his hayres full of dirt and sand, and to
conclude, evil accommodated with this tempest, he commanded us to carry him
to that place where the rest of his men were, and as well to dry him as to get
him breath, which he had almost lost, we indeauored to unclothe him, but he
refusing to be seen or to be touched by us, It made our Captain suspect that
he was not a man, for although he enforced himself to appear so, yet his
actions showed the clean contrary; when as preventing the desire which the
Captain had to be cleared of his sex, this Pilgrim of whom I tell thee
(taking him aside) confessed that she was a Woman, who came in this habit from
Italy, with her husband; in which voyage, they had suffered Shipwreck upon
this shore: And in saying this, shame and desire to defend herself, brought
color into her face, and valor into her heart; with one, she appeared
perfectly fair, and with the other extremely hardy: Nevertheless her beauty
being more powerful to hurt others, then her forces to defend herself, has
vanquished Doricles his mind, who with sweet and courteous words persuaded her
to rest this day in his company, during which time her face has never been
without tears. In the mean time he commanded, after Sunsetting, that his
supper and his bed should be provided in one of those Villages, But we
instantly heard that some charge of money which was to be carried to Genoa,
should come this way, and having waighted for them until midnight, we were
without both supper and lodging: for this cause we sent two of our companions
before, who are they which found you together with him, who conducted us
hither; Doricles he is now with this Pilgrim; I cannot tell thee whether he
has gained her or no, nor whether the bed had made a peace between two minds
so absolutely differing: but certain it is that they are now lodged together.

The Soldiers did easily perceive that the Pilgrim hearing this story, bathed
his face with his tears, and with sad and violent sighings endeavored to
pierce heaven: They desiring the cause, he remaining a long time silent, and
they still pressing him; In the end he began to cry out; Oh miserable, wretch,
that I am, I have lost my honor, my glory is destroyed, my hope is dead, by
the hands and weakness of a Woman. O that ever the Sea pardoned my life, since
that with so much pity, it reserved thine, to the end that my eyes might be
witnesses (after so many labors and dangers) of such an offense. Well did the
Soldiers know that this was the man whom the Pilgrim respected, and the true
North star unto which she turned the needle of her affection: but they
endeavoring to comfort him, so much increased his fury, that drawing forth his
sword out of his Pilgrims staff, the out side whereof served as a scaberd, he
ran enraged out of this house unto the house where the Captain lay, and
there gave such blows upon the door, and such loud cries, that the Captain
thinking, he had bin assailed by the Justice or by the Inhabitants of that
place, leaped out of his bed in his shirt, his Pistol in his hand, and opening
the door asked who was there? A wretched man, answered the Pilgrim with an
incredible fiercenes, and one from whom thou have taken his honor, with this
vile woman which thou do possess. Doricles discharged his Pistol and the
Pilgrim turning his body, the bullet light in his arm. All the company ran
thither at the noise, and the valiant Catalonian disposed himself to strike
quicker then the Lightning came out of thunder sent by Jove against the Giants,
when as the miserable Pilgrim woman, embracing him with prayers, begged the
Pilgrims life, saying unto Doricles, that this man was he whom she did only
acknowledge for her Master, and on the other side assuring her desperate
Husband that she had not transgressed against her honor, neither in deed, word
nor thought; because his prayers had not vanquished her, and his threats should
never. I do not know if it ought to be believed of a woman: the History
commends her Chastity, and I do religiously believe the virtue of this sex
so much esteemed by me, and so greatly had in account all my life. Doricles
would willingly that the Pilgrim should have bin contented with his life, which
he would leave him, and that he should have gone away without the woman, But
the incensed Castillian defying him to a single combat, began to defame him,
and provoke him in such manner, that he commanded his Soldiers to hang him up
at the next Tree of the mountain: hardly was the word out of the Captains
mouth, when the Pilgrim saw himself carried out of the Village by these
barbarious fellows, and upon his way toward the Wood where he should be
branched up, Seeing himself then at the place of execution and in the presence
of an vncuitable death, he entreated them with tears, that they would let him
recommend his soul to him that was the author thereof; which being permitted
unto him, he drew out of his bosom an Image of the blessed Virgin; which
holding up, with his eyes and his hands to heaven, he began his prayers
devoutly, having the match of one of their pieces about his neck near unto
him, who tied it to a bough of a great Oak, only waiting for the end of his
devotions: Nevertheless even as he fastened the last knot, the fair morning
rejoicing the world with new light, clearly discovered the amiable color of
his face.

Who will believe that in the space of one night so many fortunes should happen
to one man, if it were not known that things are written to be marked, and
that evils do seldom come alone, seeing that the evils which happen in one
night to one unfortunate man, do surpass all the prosperity which can happen
to a fortunate man in all his life? The Soldiers seeing the honest and grave
countenance of this Pilgrim, his youth and his Innocence, and being otherwise
molified with his prayers; or having their hearts secretly touched by the
hands of God, for he who hardened Pharos heart can molisie others, they
resolved to let him live, not willing to be more cruel then the Sea, which
the day before had cast him upon Land from drowning; and thinking it was an
infamous cruelty, that he who had been spared by things without sense, should
be destroyed by them who ought to have reason. The Pilgrim gives them thanks
for their liberality, and referring their reward unto heaven, entreats them
that if by chance, this Woman which he had left, did persevere in the firmnes
of her speech, they should tell her that she should find him at Barcelon: This
said, he took his way toward the City, and the Soldiers toward the Village.
But the fained news of his Death which they were constrained to deliver unto
Doricles, so much deprived the sorrowful Pilgrim woman of sense (whom he had
before thrust out of his Chamber, being vexed with her cries) that she
remained a long time as dead, and when as she was come again unto her self,
she did and said so many pitiful things, that these fierce men most
accustomed to shed blood, did now shed tears. So that the Captain despairing
of ever being able to pacify her; and thinking that the beginnings of extreme
grief do easily pass to a frenzy, commanded, that she should be carried upon
the great high way; where the miserable woman was left, drowning her self in
tears, and murdering her face with her hands, she made herself look with
great deformity: from thence following the way by the Sea side she went to
Valence.

The Pilgrim in the mean time was at Barcelon, where having stayed two days,
to view the goodly strong walls of the City; the third day as he was
beholding the Viceroyes Palace, this Fisher, whose voice had so unhappily
drawn him from the Cabens of the other Fishermen, and as a deceitful Hiena
had called him to bring his life into such danger, knew him, and demanded of
him if he were not the Thief, which entertained him the other night with
words, until his companions came and entering by force into the houses of the
Village, had robbed them and pilled them? It is true answered the Pilgrim, that
I am he who by the sound of thy voice came out of the Cabens of men of thy
profession, but not he who came with the robbers which you speak of: upon this
they contested one against the other, insomuch that the people run to the
^oyse; And as to be pursued with hue and cry, there needs no more cause but to
be a stranger, so all the world believing in the natural Catalonians words,
the poor Pilgrim was impetuously carried away, by the people, and as a robber
put into Prison.

The infamous rabble who for crimes great or small are accustomed to possess
these places, which are like so many true representations of Hell: put him into
a dark corner worse then the worst sink of Constantinople, where it is
impossible to recite the blows they gave him, and the injuries they said unto
him: because having no metal about him, but the Bullet, which Doricles shot
into him the night of his misfortune, he had not wherewith to pay his garnish
or entrance, nor ability to find better means to appease them.

Night victorious over humane cares, imposing rest unto their labors and their
thoughts, and reducing their actions to a deep silence came, amongst these
barbarous people, and the miserable stranger only not so much as closing his
eyes: he felt not the grief of his wound, not the infamy of his imprisonment,
all that which troubled him, and all that which he feared, was the Pilgrim
woman's loosing of her honor, which wrought so with him, that whilst others
slept in this confusion, without that the want of beds, the importunity of many
noisome creatures, which run up and down in the Prison, the fear of
Judgment to come, nor the present misfortune could wake them; our Pilgrim
only is awake, complaining against Heaven, the Sea, and his cruel fortune
which had preserved his life, then, when he had no feeling of death, to make
him suffer it now in a state so sensible.

At the length the Sun with a countenance full of shame and as if he had bin
constrained, shined through the thick bars of this Prison windows, showing
in the pale color of his beams, that he feared he should be stayed there,
when the pleasant blows of the Iaylor, and the sweet noise which his Keys
made in the strong locks, awaked from their forgetfulness, those unto whom the
fear of punishment for their faults could work no remembrance: But the
Pilgrim was not waked, because he was not asleep; he came out amongst the
rest nevertheless to give thanks to the day, for having passed over so
miserable a night. There began this miserable body to move his parts, going
many leagues in a little space: prayers importuned some, care wearyed others;
necessity called out here, hunger sighed there, and Liberty was wished for
every where: The Laws called upon execution, Ministers upon punishment, and
favor importuned for delay; those who had wherewith went out by the air,
others not having wherewith could not find the Door; the confusion of voices,
the unquietness of the Judge, the coming in of some, the going out of others,
and the noise of Fetters, made in this discording instrument a fearful
striving.

In this time, a Knight; who for the noblenes of his blood, and the antiquity
of his Imprisonment, was generally respected as the Master, cast his eyes upon
the Pilgrim, and considering his deep melancholy, his habit, and his person,
incited by his good countenance and aspect, (for there is no letter of favor
which works greater effects in all necessities) called him to a little alley
which answered to the door of his Chamber, and asked his name, his Country,
and the cause of his imprisonment? The Pilgrim recited unto him the success
which you have heard, beginning his life, from the time that the Sea gave it
him, by casting him upon the shore not far from the walls of Barcelon. The
Knight wondered at it, and collecting from his reasons, and the manner of his
speech, his understanding and his gentleness, took such affection unto him,
that he placed him in his Chamber: where having restored his weak forces,
with Conserues which he had, he made him discover his Arm, and he himself
healed the wound with medicines and words, which he had learned being a
Soldier; for if Herbs and stones have this virtue, wherefore should it be
wanting to holy words?

The contented Pilgrim afterward turning his eyes round about the Chamber, he
saw written upon the walls with a Coal according to the ancient manner of
Prisoners, certain Herogliffique verses, at the sight whereof, he knew that
he who had written them was not ignorant. Over the picture of a Young man, who
had the chief place, was written this Verse out of Virgill.

Antes sus oios Hector triste en Su^nnos.
After that, was painted a Heart with wings, which flewe after Death with the
Letter of Eneas, sending the body of his friend to his father Euander.

Muerto Palante;
Forcado en esta vida me detengo.
Near unto that was figured Prometheus, or Titius, who being tied with strong
Chains to the rocks of Mount Caucasus, nourished an Eagle with his intrayles,
the word was from Ovid, and said thus: O quanta pena es viuir, vida enoiosa y
forcada
Y quando la muerta agrada; Ser impossible, mori.


In a flood, between two infernal shoares, Forgetfulness was painted, being a
Young man who carried a Charger full of remembrances, which he did endeavor
to fling into the water, with this word of Lucrece: Buelue acaer quando al
estremo llega.


The Head and Harp of Orpheus were portrayed upon a gate amongst the waves of
the River Strimo, into which having been cast, by the Bachantes, they came unto
Lesbos, the word was this: Aqui lloraro seluas, fieras et Aspides.


There was also painted a Lady lying dead, with a Sword through her body, with
this word of Scalliger upon the Death of Polixena: Nobasta, Griegos que veucais
los Hombres.


In the distance which might be between the window and the flower, was
painted the Shepherd Argus with his hundred eyes, and Mercury charming him
asleep, with this line of Strossas.

Amor sutil al mas Zeloso angana.
With such and other curiosities, which the Knight writ as aptly fitting his
adventures, did he adorn his Chamber and passed away his tedious
imprisonment. Whilst that the Pilgrim was busy in beholding these conceits,
he was called before the Judges to answer the accusation against him, and he
relating simply the truth, by the little Art which he brought with him in his
speech, he plainly showed that there was no guilt in him; his cause being
recommended unto the Judges by the Knight, who writ his innocence unto them,
he was acquitted and brought back again into the Knights chamber, where they
did eat together. Their discourse which at the end of Dinner served for their
last dish (amongst other things) fell upon their misfortunes, because that
there is nothing which more aptly, and readily does ease the mind then
relation of our own misaduentures. The master of the Lodging (who could
willingly have spared that name) being entreated by the Pilgrim to relate the
cause of his imprisonment, began to speak in this manner.

The History of Mireno.
IN a little Town not far from this great City, there was a Gentleman named
Telemaquus married with a fair Lady, not so chaste as the Roman Lucrece
although she carried her name; the report was, that this Marriage was made
against her mind, and it is likely to be true, as by the effects it was
afterward witnessed: her melancholy increased, her beauty and clothes
neglected, did show a languishment, like Roses, when the radical moisture of
their boughs do decrease. Telemaquus did enforce himself to divert her from
this sad kind of neglect, least it might seem unto some which should see her,
that this sadness proceeded from his default, for oftentimes innocent Husbands
are accused for their wives evil conditions. He apparelled her richly, carried
her to solace and recreate her self to Sea, and to see the choicest Gardens.
And this being not sufficient he opened his house to all good company. Amongst
the young Knights which did ordinarily frequent and converse with them, there
was one called Mireno, so much my friend, that if Death had not set a
difference between us, I could not have bin persuaded (he being alive) to
discern which of us two had bin my self. This man cast his eyes (until this
time busied in the consideration of another beauty) upon Telemachusses fair
wife; who looking upon him more earnestly then upon any other, had (it may be)
incited him: for although it be said that Love can pierce as a Spirit, into
the most close and secret places: Yet I do think it impossible, that any man
should Love, if he be not at the first obliged thereunto by some little hope.
He concealed from me the beginning of his thought: for love is always borne
discreet, and dumb as a Child. But the same sweetness of its conversation does
so quickly teach it to speak, that like a Prisoner at the Bar he oftentimes
casts himself away by his own tongue. So after he saw himself admitted in
Lucrece her eyes (an evident index that he was already in her soul) not being
able to suffer the glory of that whereof he easily endured the pain; he made
unto me a great discourse of his Fortune, or to say truer, of his folly; which
could not have bin hurtful unto him, if he had followed my advise as well as
he asked it. But it is ordinary, especially with those who are in Love, to ask
counsel, then when as for nothing in the world they would forbear* to do
that which they have in their mind. I left no History, either divine, or
humane, which was within my knowledge and to purpose, that I did not lay before
him, exagerating the evils, which did proceed from like enterprises. But
Mireno who had already firmly determined to follow his purpose, and thinking
that I was not apt for his design, by little and little, forbear to visit me.
Quickly did he forbear to accompany me in walking: we went no more by day to
public conuersations, nor by night to private; A notable error in the
condition of men, whose loves and friendships are kept by flattery, and lost by
truth. I did bear Mireno's absence with great impatience, and he had no
feeling of his living without me; because Lucrece being now his whole soul,
could not suffer that he should have another Mireno: having thus shaken me
off, communicates his business with a third, who was so common a friend unto us
both, that when I wanted Mireno, or Mireno wanted me, we did seek one the
other at his house: This man was not so considerate as I was, contrariwise
there was no kind of danger, into which he would not precipitate himself to
pleasure his friend; such friends are like powder in Festival days, which to
rejoice others spends it self. This made me disguise my self to follow them
in the night; and one time above the rest, when I had more patience, and they
less consideration then ordinary, I saw how they set a Ladder to a window of
a Tower, which discovered a spacious prospect into the Sea, over a Garden of
Telemaquus: I stayed the end not to be answered what they did, but to see if I
could serve in any stead in the importance of this danger, and my heart did not
deceive me, although Mireno who was within it did deceive me. For after the
first sleep, then when as with less force he vanquisheth the cares of a
master of a family, I heard a noise, and presently I saw Mireno coming down
a Ladder, and Aurelio (for so was he called with whom he was accompanied)
receiving him in his arms, persuaded him to fly: hardly were they out of the
street, when as a servant loosing the Ladder let it fall, I run to the fall
thereof, and as well as I could gathering it up, stepped behind a corner, from
whence I espied Telemaquus in his shirt, having his Sword naked in one hand,
and a Candle in the other: and looking out at the window of the Tower if he
could discern any thing upon the ground, of that which he had heard: I crept
softly to the gate; and harkening what was said in this family where there was
this alaram, I understood that the disgrace of our two Lovers, was taken to be
the industry of Robbers. In this they were not deceived, for those are no small
thieves, who steal good name and rob away honor: I returned much contented to
my house, and slept but evil, in this care: The morning being come I sent for
Mireno, with whom having discoursed of diverse matters, I asked what news of
Lucrece? he told me he did not speak with her: For all wicked secrets do
for the most part conceal themselves from true friends. I said then unto him,
that I wondered he would dissemble a thing so known; Telemaquus her Husband
being come unto my house, to tell me that he had heard him within his; that
looking out of a window of a Tower, he had seen him go down by a Ladder:
Mireno astonished and wondering at my relation, confessed unto me what had
passed, and how Lucrece having yielded unto his Letters, messages, and services
had made him master of her liberty, yielding unto him the treasure which was so
evil kept by Telemaquus his hundred eyes. Which was the cause why I placed
this Hiroglifique of Argus and Mercury, with this saying of Strossa: Subtle
love deceives Jealousy.


He proceeded to tell me that when Telemaquus was asleep, they talked
together in a Garden, into which he entered by a Ladder made of cords, which
Aurelio kept, unto whom only he had imparted this secret, having found me so
auerse from succouring him. I asked what he had done with the ladder? he
told me that from the leaving of that, proceeded Telemaquusses advertisement.
The letting him see it, I told him that Telemaquus knew nothing, neither had
the Ladder served as an occasion to discover any thing unto him: And letting
him see the service which I had done him, I did begin to conjure him, that he
would in these terms leave, the perilous success which he ought to expect
from the pursuit of this design, seeing that Telemaquus at the least had
notice, that his Wife was not by his side when there was noise in the Lodging:
So that he promised me, he would not go any more thither, and the more to
divert him from going thither, he resolved to absent himself from Barcelon. I
confirmed him in this resolution; because that truly there is nothing which so
much ecclipseth the desire of Lovers, as an interposed distance of place
between them; yet it was not needful, because by that time Mireno disposed
himself to depart, Telemaquus already changed his dwelling from this City
unto the little place where he was married; And this was a memorable
observation, Mireno loosing the ordinary view of his Lucrece, lost her also out
of his thought, and confirmed his Love better then ever to Erisila, (she was
that other Lady whom I in the beginning of my discourse I said he had loved)
who again loved him better and with more pleasure then before, because that
Love, which succeeds after jealousy is more violent, besides the amiable
parts which were in Mireno, who was of a goodly stature, of great spirit, and
an illustrious blood, of a free condition, amiable both a horsbacke, and a
foot, and renowned beyond all of his age, for all Military exercise; As for his
face behold this Picture, wherein I assure you, the Painter was no flatterer; I
keep it here for my comfort, although it be always present in my soul, as
you may judge by these words following: Before his Eyes in a Dream, sad
Hector did appear.
Because that truly his image did never abandon my sight, but either sleeping
or waking he was represented to my eyes: In effect we fell into our old
imwardnes; but in the midst of this peace, the love of Telemaquus had so much
power over him, that vanquished with his wives Prayers, he brought her again
to Barcelon, where she was no sooner seen by Mireno, but the ancient flames of
his love, blowing away the ashes into the wind, discovered themselves more
lively: And I fearing what might happen by this coming back of Lucrece,
persuaded Mireno to marry; And he himself finding that it was honorablest*
the easiest and the safest way to v^inde himself from these Loves, entreated
me to find out some worthy subject, who might set a bound unto his Affections:
I propounded many who I thought were of his quality although not of his merit;
But it was with him as with those who buy without pleasure, and do not
content themselves with any price; for some are too high, other too low: these
black, those pale; one lean, the other too fatt; this was too fine, an other
too sluttish: To be short,, seeing he liked none of those, and would not
marry, I left him, for I saw that Lucrece had more power with him then all
they together. They then began to see one the other again, for in these good
works, mediators are sildome wanting: Erisila who was passionatly in love with
Mtreno, began to discern in him a coldenes and a carelesnes in seeing her, and
that he did divert himself by other pleasures; She (in this suspicion, which
may be called a true jealousy) began to observe and follow him; so that
without spoiling much, she knew, if not all that passed, at the least what was
the subject which ravished away her Mireno.

Who will believe so extraordinary a conceit as I shall tell you? truly he
only, who does know how much the spirit of a woman is disposed (especially if
she love) to any kind of industry and subtlety: E isila never leaves seeking
occasion that Telemaquus should see her, until in the end Telemaquus did
behold her, and in viewing Erisila, he saw in her a brave disposition of a
woman, who looked upon him with fair and sweet eyes; for when they will
deceive, they make their eyes snares, and their sweetnesses baytes: Telemaquus
yielded himself (although he loved Lucrece) forced by the eyes and beauty of
Erisila, which did so much the more provoke him, by how much she desired to
deceive him: he began to come to her House, and she to feign a great deal of
passion, Mireno giving them leisure enough, in regard he did not frequent her
house as he was accustomed: Finally their affection came to the point that
Erisila desired. Then she said unto him one day (as if she had not known him to
be married, which he desembled also) that she had seen him enter into one
Lucrece her house, whereat she had conceived great jealousy* Telemaquus
smiling, began to appease her saying, that it was without any design that he
had entered into this house (whereof indeed he was Master:) and as she began to
witness a more feeling sorrow, accompanied with false tears; he beg^n to
remonstrate that Lucrece was virtuous and well borne; with a great many other
commendacions of her chastity, and of Telemaquus her husbands care (commending
himself.) And some are of opinion, that selfe-commending is not vnbeseming,
when it imports the good opinion of an other man. Erisila then finding a good
occasion for her wicked design, told him, that Lucrece husband might be a
gallant man, Yet nevertheless, she knew that Lucrece did not forbear, to make
Love unto a Knight of the City; and she was afraid that she might as well
love him as the other: because what woman soever she be, she does easily
suffer her self to be won, after the first lightness: Telemaquus who began
to wax so pale that it was easy to be known in his face, what interest he
had in this discourse; entreated her to discover who was this Knight: But she
feigning to be iealouse of him, whom she did endeavor to make so iealouse,
inforceth her complaints, persuading him, that she was troubled with that
jealousy, which indeed she had raised in him. To be short, Erisila unwilling
to name who it was; Telemaquus suddenly stepped to her, and drawing his Dagger,
setting it to her throat made her utter the name of Mireno, a person whom he
knew better then she: with this Telemaquus went away, confessing it was true
that he had loved Lucrece, not knowing she had another Lover; but now from
this tiem forward he would hate her, and would settle all his affection upon
her, in confirmation of which, he gave her a chain of gold, and a Diamond.

By this means, Erisila thought that the Husband would keep his house, and
that Mireno (by this means barred from seeing Lucrece) would come to visit her
as he was accustomed. But the Knight, whom it concerned to wipe away this spot
from his honor by his blood who had offended him, Seeing it was now no longer
time to keep that, which was lost, feigning a few days after to go to
Montserrat, gave a beginning to his revenge, and an end unto my life. The two
Lovers were not such sots, nor I such a fool, that we did not think
(although we were ignorant of Erisilus malice) that this absence might be
feyned; having had so many examples in the world; wherefore we sent our
faithful friend Aurelio secretly after him. But the advised Telemaquus, who
knew well that he was not to deceive fools, went thither infallibly, whether
he said he would, and assured us in such manner, with this truth, that he
deceived us after at his pleasure: because that another time, feyning that he
went to Valence, he returned when he was half way, and hid himself in
Barcelon.

Now Mireno could not sleep so assured with Lucrece but that I kept the Door,
although he did entreat me not to do it; God knows how many nights I passed
without pleasure; for my heart did always tell me that their two lives did
run a dangerous Fortune. But Telemaquus the third night after entering by a
secret door, into the Garden (I spoke of unto you) without being heard or
seen by any person, with only one servant with him, who carried a Halberd,
came unto the Chamber where his steps were heard, and out of which Mireno came
to meet him, very evil provided of arms to defend himself, not that I doubt
he would not have well defended himself, half asleep and naked as he was,
with his Sword alone which he had in his hand: If his adversary, who was
accommodated with more aduantageable arms, had not overthrown him dead to the
ground with a Harquebush shot: the report of the piece, made me judge that
such a salutation at that time of the night, was rather a condemnation, then
any thing else: wherefore indeauouring to break open the doors, I waked the
neighbors, some of whom running thither with their arms, and having helped me
to overthrow the doors, we entered in. Already had Telemaquus, broke into his
Caben, where Lucrece was hid, and dragging her from thence, not far from the
place where Mireno lay, he thrust his sword into her, so that when we came,
her breath went away with the last Jesus. And seeing that he had killed Mireno,
me thought Scaligers verse, which is under this picture was not unapt: Was it
not enough to kill and vanquish men?


I had not as yet seen Mireno, and searching him with mine eyes all about the
room, I saw him lying Dead: thou may see in the tears which now flow from
my eyes, what was then my grief, I do not know what I did, yet seeking for
Telemaquus, I did excuse him for the care of defending himself; and from
justifying so bloody an execution: For having met face to face, I thrust at
him, with which thrust, he accompanied their two lives, which he had
extinguished. By this time the house was beset, by those whom the Justice had
raised, who apprehended as many as they found, and me especially, for having
killed Telemaquus without cause, although according to the Laws of the world
there was but too much cause, and here they put me where thou now see me,
and where I have lived this five years, desiring Death, as thou may see by
this winged Heart of mine flying after this Image of dead Mireno; with this
word out of Virgill: My Palas dead, I bide alive by force.


My travels are figured in those of Siciphus, and Titius, and represented by
these words out of Ovid:

O wretched state, constrained to live
In plaints eternally:
When Death which only help can give,
Affords no power to dye.
The sorrow which this great City felt by the loss of Mireno, is expressed
in this figure of the Head and heart of Orpheus, with this word: There wept the
Woods, the Beasts, and Snakes.
For I do not think that there was either tree or stone which were not moved
with this so pitiful an accident. And here will I end his Story, with these
tears which I will offer incessantly to his memory, and these words which I
have made for Lucrece her Tomb.

Here lies Lucrece, less chaste then the Roman, but more fair: Tarquin did
not force her, but love; and although she dyed for her infidelity, Love, who
was the cause, is of power to excuse her.

So the fair Lucrece remained in mortal rest, and her name, in my
imagination, not worthy of blame: for having been overcome by the excellent
parts of her Lover, and by that unchangeable force which Love ever uses
against great and free courages.

The Pilgrims imprisonment had not passed at so easy a rate of his patience,
had not Euerard (so was the Knight called that made this Discourse) favored
his affairs: for his innocence could not gain him his libertiye, nor good
opinion, which he did deserve; so powerful was his only habit, to work in
the Judges an evil conceit of his person; Yet Doricles (Captain of those
Robbers) being pardoned, and received again into the Cities favor; the Pilgrim
was also absolved, as his Confederates.

His curiosity to hear the Fisher-mans singing, having brought him to receive
a hurt in his Arm with a Piece, into an extreme danger of hanging, unto the 3.
months imprisonment, which without the help of Euerard had been insupportable.
They take their leaves one of an other, with a thousand loving imbracings, and
Euerard having further obliged him with some money, he resolved to go to
Mountserrat, and I to finish this First Book.

The end of the First Book.
The Second Book.
BY a straight way, between thick Trees and shady did the Pilgrim go toward
Mountserrat, who turning his head at a noise which he heard behind at his
back, he saw two young men with Palmers staves, whose fair faces, and white
hair made them show to be either Germans or Flemmings, He saluted them, and
joyful of so good company, he imposed silence unto a thousand sad thoughts,
which solitarines had brought into his memory; And traveling together, they
began to discourse of diverse matters, with which they easily and with pleasure
passed away the craggy, and uneven way of the mountain, until they came unto
a Fountain, which bubling into a valley, made a gentle harmony; So that as it
were invited by the sweet noise, and the fresh shade, they sat down upon the
rushes which grew by the Brook side, and admiring the sweet complaints of the
Nightingale; one of the Almans, which showed a good nature imbellished with
Learning, began to discourse of Filomelas love, saying that now she would
recompense with her infinite notes, all the time that she had bin dumb after
Terreus had cut out her tongue. The Spaniard, replied that Martial, had
uttered the same conceit, and the Alman rejoicing to find in him more capacity
then in common persons (for it is an insupportable labor to travel with an
ignorant man) rise from the place where he sat, and embracing him with a great
deal of contentment, after many other discourses, Let us go, said he, adore
the blessed Virgin. In this Image so much renowned, through all the world, we
cannot make a more holy voyage, nor I in better company then thine: let us go
said the Spaniard by this pathe, which seems to me to be much the shorter,
although a little steeper, for the most part of the way.

This being said, they took their way toward the Temple, which they
discovered shortly after, built upon the side of a sharp Mountain, and under
a great Rock, which did seem to threaten it with ruin.

When they were entered, with devotion and humility, casting their eyes into
this Tapestry of France, Almane, and almost all the world: they were
astonished, to see the walls decked with so many excellent Paintings,
Histories, and accompanied with a thousand several kinds of offerings, which
with an admirable correspondency did stir up and astonish the senses
altogether. There did they power forth their prayers and their tears, and
after they had seen, and been informed of all that was considerable, in this
Monastery, the day having lost her beauty, by the Suns absence; they retired
altogether until the morning shining through the Eastern gates gave them
knowledge of the new days approach. Then they resolved to visit the diverse
habitations of the Hermits, which lived in these Mountains, and being come
unto the seventh Hermitage, they found a young man of an agreeable countenance,
and a goodly presence, whose long and well combed hair, gave a reverent
majesty unto his aspect. This man stayed them dinner, and after their repast,
being entreated by the Pilgrims to tell them what devotion had confined him
into these solitary mountains; he related the history of his life, in this
manner.

The History of Aurelia.
AMongst all the things, which in the course of my life I have seen and
marked, I might peradventure tell you some one, which might better content you.
But thinking that one cannot better persuade, then by the example of himself;
I will therefore tell you a story which is drawn from my youth, and from the
Twentieth year of my age, written by my misfortune, and imprinted in my memory,
seeing that the renewing can do me no damage, and may bring you profit. This
short tyranny, the bayte of youth, the illusion of the sight, the prison of
the soul, and the darkner of the sense, which is called Beauty, and which
heaven seems to give Women for our mischief: blinded so my eyes at the first
knowledge, which they had in the world, that my spirit did not live so much in
my self, as in her whom I loved, nor found more rest out of her sight, then
things do out of their centure; because that as the fire always sends the
flames thereof to its proper sphaere, so my heart adressed his desires to her
beauty.

Now as this Love was not Platoniqe. I will not dispute whether it were honest,
profitable, or delightful; Let it satisfy, that it, which is the cause of so
much evil, seemed unto me, the greatest and soueraignest good in the world.
This subject of my misfortunes, was called Aurelia, free in her customs, of
that kind of life, which Plautus and Terence describe in their Fables; and of
whom Auulus says excellently well; That a Curtezan is a vessel full of holes,
which can contain nothing. She was fair in all perfection, of a quick and
hardy spirit, and of a reasonable good nature, a woman (to be short) unto whom
experience in the world had brought a great deal of knowledge. It cost me
little to possess her, because that these kind of women (clean contrary unto
other women, who forced by the Love of a man, do honestly yield unto his
merits) trusting to their charms and unto the gentleness of usage, passionate
men more when they are inioyed, then when they are pretended. I was not vexed
at the first, with the conversation of young men, who at any hour how
extraordinary soever, were never wanting in her house, because the favors
which she did me, and the little which they cost me, made me live much
contented, especially seeing my self preferred before others, of better means
and merits then my self; when I went to see her, they gave me place, and
departed courteously, leaving me alone with her.

These my visitations were not agreeable unto her servants, because they
thought, that thereby, this rabble of youth was scattered, which brought them
profit. And that if Aurelia should fall in Love with me; my quality being not
capable to sustain her expense, she must spend out of her own means, from
whence would vneuitably follow a necessity of living more regularly, which they
would by no means hear of; And of this were they not much deceived, for in a
small time Aurelia, who had ravished so many others, was taken her self in my
love, and made captive to my will, which made true one part of this fear, and
shortened the revenues of her house, to lengthen the reins of her pleasure. Not
that all the charge of the house, fell upon her; for I miserable man,
tormenting my Parents, and importuning my friends, did run to the
preservation of this love, which almost always depended of money.

The life which we led (we loving one another tenderly, and having in our
power the liberty of inioying) may easily be judged by my youth, and by
Aurelia*s, who was then about 20. years old. The house seemed too straight
for our Love, and searching solitary fields, we made the sight of open heaven
witness of our folies, our life was a blind imitatio^ of the nature of Beasts,
we communicated our secrets to Trees, which did not see, as if the leaves had
not been so many clear eyes, and a thousand amorous delights to the dumb
Fountains, which might well have troubled the purity of their waters, I cannot
think how in so little a way as there was between my house, and hers. I
remained 5 years space before I knew that I was arrived there, being certain,
that in 3. years space of that time, the famous English Drake passed the
straight of Magellan, and compassed the world about. If in all this time, the
loyalty which she swore unto me, were broken or no, I am not able to say, nor
yet forbear to believe, because it seems almost a thing impossible, for such
women from their custom, to keep themselves to an orderly life.

At the end of these five years, I saw my self at the end of my means, and
although I was more amorous then in the beginning, yet Aurelia did suffer
herself to be vanquished by the obligations of another, who had more power,
then my services: I say obligations, because I cannot believe, that only Love
can bind one unto so strange a change. One night Aurelia having seen me
retire my self unto my bed, she had received Feliciano into hers (so was the
Knight called.) I stirred with a profound Jealousy, rise up out of my bed, and
went to her house, where the door was shut against me: and the servants
answered me from above out at an high window, feyning that they were gone to
bed, to make me rather to retire unto my own house. But my extreme love which
would not at that time, have relied upon my eyes, and feared to be betrayed by
my thoughts: made me cry aloude, that some body should open the door, so that
my voice came unto Aurelia's ears. And Feliciano making show of a
valiant-Louer, began to cloth himself, promising to chastise my boldness with
his Sword, and by his only presence to cure my folly; But the cunning Circe,
who knew well what good or bad success soever came unto me, it would redound
unto her shame; hindered him with her arms, and diuerted him with her tears,
although there was no great need: For the brauest do unwillingly arm
themselves, when they are once naked; and to come out of a house into the
street, had been a manifest and mad rashness.

Aurelia so prevailing, in that manner, wherein others of her kind are wont to
prevail; and making Feliciano believe, that I should be her husband, and that
if I did perceive him, she should loose me; persuaded him half unclothed, and
in the midst of January, that he would go into the highest roof of the
house. Into which he being gone, I was let into the house, where I found
Aurelia in bed making so many complaints of my liberty, and of the scandal
which I gave the neighbors, that in stead of being angry, it behooved me to
appease her, where (after some time spent) she in complaining of me, and I in
asking pardon for my jealousy, and for the desire which I had to surprise her
in that infidelity which I did distrust: I possessed the absent man's place, which
was still warm, serving for a proof of my ignorance and blockishnes.

Morning brought again the Sun, and the Sun the Day, yet neither of them was
sufficient to make me see my folly (so evil does a Lover discern of his own
acts) I rise contented, and although I entered last, yet I went sooner away then
Feliciano.

In the mean time Menander who had for the space of some years, been
Feliciano's Mistress, grew extremely jealous, and hearing of this trick, which
Aurelia had put upon him, could not forbear speaking of it, mocking him with
the cold night which he had endured, and that he had suffered me, who never
had any intent to marry her, to possess that place by her side which he had
lost: Feliciano assured her, that Aurelia (preferring his Love, before the
obligations, wherein for so many years she was bound unto me) did rather abuse
me then him; and that whenever she or any other, would afford him the like
courtesy, he would willingly suffer one evil night, to have so many good: and
for proof of what he said, he gave her a key, whereof I was wont to be master,
which I was made believe was lost. Menander dissembled her thoughts, but so
soon as she met me again, she told me all the circumstances, and with all
gave me the Key; having which, I needed no other witnesses of the truth, nor
other instrument to open the door. I then resolved to revenge my self of
Aurelia in leaving her, and of Feliciano, in serving Menander, from whose Love
I presumed he had not freed himself, and if he had bin free, yet I knew he
must needs be grieved, that I should enjoy her whom he loved in every bodies
opinion. I found Menander willingly disposed, for our thoughts were alike, and
our injury alike, and we might well serve to revenge one the other; She then
feyned to love me, and I paid her in the like counterfeiting. Aurelia was
advertised, and grew desperate, and Feliciano no less intaged, sought me to
kill me. Behold how iealousies and neglects do discover the truths, which are
in the centure of hearts.

Aurelia found me sooner then Feliciano did, as she who therein hazerded
least: and staying me began in fury and in threatenings, yet ended in prayers
and in tears: But upon so fresh an injury, I was rather confirmed in my
neglect (seeing her yield unto my love) then any way moved with her passion.
Finally, having changed my first affection into hatred, (always insupportable
to a woman who has been well beloved) Aurelia began to pursue me, and
although that the City of my birth and abode, does not yield for greatness, to
above two or three in all Spain, yet could not I find any lodging wherein she
did not clamor me, any friend whom she did not revolt from me, any secret
which she did not publish, nor any danger whereinto she did not endeavor to
throw me; So that oppressed with these pursuits, and seeing my self reduced
to the contenting her, after a thousand contrary deliberations, I resolved to
take upon me a religious habit, and to prevail by his protection, in whose
hands and feet God has imprinted the marks of our reperation. St. Fran.


But O thesupreme force of a despised Love, from the holy Quire of the Temple,
from the midst of the Alters, and Images of the Saints, the tears of Aurelia
drew me again; And then I followed her, with more liberty and less shame then
before, leaving the habit whereof I was not worthy, and neglecting the
spiritual treasure, which I did then enjoy, to follow the infamous life which
I had formerly led, so much power has the capital enemy of our souls. Our
love began fresher then ever, with the general scandal of those who knew us,
the hatred of our Parents, and the detestation of all our friends, which within
a small time brought me to such terms, that I thought sorrow would have
killed me. The infamy wherein we lived and the fear of Justice did oblige us,
to depart the City, and feiling that small remainder of goods which we had
left, laden with a number of evils, we passed into Italy; from whence, I went
(for some time) to serve the Catholic King in Flaunders, and the Duke of Sauoy
in Piemont, returning always to Naples where I had left her. The last time I
put to Sea with her in my company, (intending after the Flaunders wars, to
return into Spain) where in a violent tempest, (which heaven for the quiet of
our souls) sent us in the gulf of Narbone; in the last point of life, and
when we were past hope of scaping, we vowed our selves to a Religious life,
with such earnestnes of tears, that afterward the storm ceasing and we
landing, she entered into the Monastery of the Conception; and I underwent this
habit wherein you now see me, where after some years of approbation this Cell
was given me.

Here Tirsis the Hermit of this happy abode stayed his discourse, and our
Pilgrims judging that it was too late to pass further, being to descend
necessarily into the Lodging, which within this holy House is given freely to
strangers; they went unto the Monastery, discoursing upon the Hermits relation,
determining the next day to go to the uttermost hermitage, which under the
title of St. Jerome, crowns the head of the Mountain.

But the misfortunes of our Pilgrim, which had slept for some time, began to
wake with more violence; for in the house where these strangers had lodged,
there was wanting some Jewels, with a Maid servant of the house, and the
Almains amongst others, were pursued by the Justice, although innocent, because
it was affirmed by some, that this servant inamored of their beauties, had
run away with them.

All Nations have their Epithites, which being once received by the world can
never be lost. The Scithians are called cruel, The Italians religious, The
French noble, The Dutch industrious, The Persians faithless, The Turks
lascivious, The Parthians curious, The Burgundians fierce, The Britains hardy,
The Egiptians valiant, The Loraines gentle, The Spaniards arrogant, and the
Almains beautiful. And this was the cause for which it was thought, the Maid
being seduced by them had run away with them.

Now the Almains were easily taken, but the Pilgrim desperate through his late
long imprisonment, which he had suffered in Barcelon, and out of the little
justice which he as a stranger could expect, seeing them come unto him, stood
upon his defense, and flourishing his Palmers staff, (with which he was very
skillful) lest two of them lying upon the ground wounded, and virtuously freed
himself from the hands of the others, who remained astonished at his valor.

Between Tortose and Castillon, there stretches forth a great hill, wherewith
the Sea of that cost is bounded, along the the cost of the vale of Sago and
of the Kingdom of Valence: where the Moors of Argiere do land out of their
Gallyes, when they are not perceived by the watch, and hiding themselves
amongst the hollow places of these hills, do rob not only the Fishermen, but
all such as pass that way. And sometime when they are many of them together,
they do rob away whole Villages together; in this vale, they being guided by
Renegados, and those betrayed again by the Moors: There one dark night did
the Pilgrim lie (weary with his journey which he had taken out of the way)
obliged thereunto by the fear which he had of pursuit. And being asleep
after many long and grievous imaginations of his lost happiness, which he did
believe to be still in the hands of Doricles, as the roaring of the Sea (the
waves whereof breaking against the rocks make a horrible noise) awaked him. He
heard near unto him the voice of some Moors, who having joyfully supped upon
the Land, were talking of their Robberies. He who sleeping upon the ground in
the field, at his wakiug, finds himself near unto a venomous Snake, does
not so soon loose his color, as does our fearful Pilgrim, hearing the
Moors so near him, whose hands he did think it impossible to escape; Yet
relying upon his judgment in a matter wherein he thought his force would not
prevail, stole from them by gentle sliding upon the ground, making his hands
perform the office of his feet until he had attained the top of the hill,
where finding that the Moors had heard him, he began to cry with a loud
voice; Here valiant Knights here, this is our day: behold the Moors before
you, and as a pray in your hands, whom you have with such pains and diligence
endeauored to overtake: Hardly had he courageously uttered these words, when as
the Moors, (like Frogs who at the noise of passengers leap from the bancke
sides, into the quiet waters of the Lakes) ran with all the speed they could to
the Sea to get aboard their Boat, with which they easily got to their Galley.

Full of admiration was the Pilgrim, to see how happily his resolution had
succeeded, when from a Tree which was near unto him he heard a voice, which
said: Ah Knight help me for the mother of Gods sake. His valiant courage which
was never astonished with any kind of danger or misfortune, guided by the
voice unto the tree, where he had heard him, saw a man tied thereunto, of whom
having asked his name, he was answered, that he was a Catalonian Knight, whom
the Moors (after they had killed two of his servants) had taken upon the poast
way of Valence. The Pilgrim having unbound him, and both of them departing from
the Sea, took their way to Almenare, and through the Valley beautified with
Orange trees, traveled toward Faura. Already had the morning strewed pearls
upon Flowers, who putting their heads forth of the boughs, did seem to
salute the day, when both the discourse, and face of the Knight, did show unto
the Pilgrim that this was Euerard, he who (when he was prisoner at Barcelon)
had obliged the Pilgrim for his liberty; both their joys, their imbracings,
and their tears, were as admirable, as the success which you have heard: From
whence is collected, how agreeable unto Heaven is the good which is done unto
strangers; signified by the ancient Philosopher in Denoalion and Pirra, who for
having Lodged Jupiter, were made restorers of the world; and contrarily,
Diomedes devouring his guests with his Horses, he was in the end himself
devoured by them.

The Pilgrim demanded of Euerard how he had gotten his liberty, and he told
him that with the help of some friends, he had broken Prison, and escaped away
by the post of Barcelon; from whence he might well have gone for Italy, but
being unwilling to be a runaway from his own Country, he was resolved, to
go to the Court, to have his cause judged, whether he was going with that
intention, when he fell into this Ambuscado of the Moors. He then demanded
of him, if he knew Doricles? and being answered that he was his kinsman, the
Pilgrim sighed many times, without telling the cause, although he were much
importuned by Euerard, unto whom he only said, he had a young Brother in his
company who had quited him to follow Doricles; Euerard who understood something
of the secrets, (suspecting that this was some Woman, who had been stolen away
by the robbers upon the shore of Barcelon) assured him that he knew all the
servants which Doricles had in his house, and that there was not one Castelian
amongst them.

In such and like words, which drew infinite sighs and tears from the
Pilgrim, they arrived at the ancient Moruiedro, (where at this day are
remaining, the most famous works of the Roman greatness, of any that are in
Spain) and from thence they went to the City of Valence, entering by the royal
Bridge Turio, which river the Moors call Gandalabiar: and passing by the
famous Tower of Serranos, they lodged at a Knights house, who was friend unto
Euerard, and of the Family of the Mercaderos. There they remained this night,
finishing the relation of their fortunes, until the Sun rising called them
from their rest, especially Euerard, who carried with a strong desire of
finishing his intended journey, departed with grief from the company of the
Pilgrim, whom he left no less sorrowful, in this flourishing City.

There he spent a few days in beholding the proud buildings wherewith it was
imbelished: and in the end he visited the Hospital where mad folks are with
more care and conueniencie looked unto and kept, then in any City in all
Spain: There beholding the several humors of these miserable people, he (I
say) who lately was likely to have lost his own wits, saw amongst those who
were least mad, sit down at the Table, (at which they did altogether eat) a
young Fool and very beautiful, whose flaxen hair was longer then men do
ordinarily wear in Spain; All the blood in this Pilgrims body came into his
face, and went suddenly back again, out of the remembrance which this mad
creature brought unto him of his Mistress, whom he could not well know, as well
because he could not comprehend in his mind, by what means she had been
reduced to this distraction; and less, how to this place, as also through her
evil usage in that place, and her sickness, she did differ from the Idea which
he had of her countenance in his mind. Nevertheless, as she beheld him with her
eyes full of admiration, he was confirmed in his first thought, and letting
fall some tears, he said unto her in a low voice (least the Keeper who had
brought them to the Table should hear them) do ye know me? to whom this woman
(never known to be so in that place) who had seen him carried unto the Oaks of
the mountain, where Captain Doricles had commanded his Soldiers to hang him,
for whose death she had shed so many tears, and sighed out so many
complaints, that the violence of her grief had troubled her understanding;
and yet also doubting of his life, though she did see him; tremblingly
answered, that she was wont to know him: Already was this Pilgrim, by the
voice, by the fearfulnes, and by the tears assured, that this mad body was the
master of all his wits; and fearing least he might make some demonstration of
his inward grief, whereunto by the sight of this so great misfortune he was
obliged; he demanded softly of her, how and by what means she was come unto
this miserable estate? The grief I took (answered she) thinking upon your
death, so soon as the Captain had commanded that you should be hanged, not
without having offended me, replied the Pilgrim, a thing which I never expected
from your constancy, although far greater occasion had been offered. The
loosing of my honor (said she) must be out of these two respects, either of
force or for pleasure: if out of pleasure, I had now no cause to bewail my
self; nor if it were by force means to bring remedy, and less means had I
in loosing of my wits; And that it is true, that the very thought I had of
your death was the cause of my madness, let this satisfy you, to see that I
recover them, in having you alive. Fair Nisa answered the Pilgrim, am not I a
miserable man, in having been the cause of so much evil by my misfortunes?
There is nothing dear Pamfilus (replied Nisa in weeping) deserves this name
that has been suffered for your occasion, and for so cruel a feeling as the
report of your death brought to me; And if I were permitted to embrace you
here according unto my desire, the recompense would be as great as the
travels, which I do bewail only, in regard they were no more, since that,
according to their multitude, they would augment the glory of my suffering. It
was not in vain, answered Pamphilus, (for the History names him from hence
forward) that my hope made me desire to live, only that I might see you, for I
was assured that in the glory of beholding you, all jealousy would be wiped
away, that might any way allay my joy. And if the eyes of those who look upon
us, did not better see, then their understandings do know, you should before
this have found, that your desire of embracing was most agreeable unto me. To
this said Nisa (whose name hitherto we have hid) as also Pamphilus his,
because that travailing in this habit amongst so many dangers, (I durst not
tell their Country nor their name) I will make my passion serve as a remedy.
What passion answered Pamphilus. Every time said she when my grief depriues
me of my reason, they tell me that I cry aloude, those words which I will now
say to thee, in embracing thee. And then she said these words; O my spouse, is
it possible that my eyes do behold thee? Is it not thou, who dyed in the
mountains of Barcelon, by the evil hands of Doricles barbarous Soldiers?
blessed be the hour wherein I see the news is false. In speaking this, Nisa
fell about Pamphilus his neck, amorously embracing him, whose unspeakable
pleasure was only interrupted, by the presence of the assistants.

When the man who had the charge of appeasing the mad solkes fury, saw this
deportment in Nisa, he began to give her rude words, and more sharp blows.
Let him alone said Pamphilus, for I am his Countriman and his wives kinsman,
and do not wonder that this sight of me, does cause in him this sortowe.
Whatsoever you are, answered this barbarous fellow, it skils not, here is
neither complements nor visitations: And the token of this man's mad fit in
coming upon him, is to call his Husband, with such or the like words. But if
I pacify this his mad fit said Pamphilus, to what eud does your chasticement
serve? And how will you appease it said the other, Is not this an evident token
of his madness, that he calls you his spouse, and takes you for a woman? You are
ignorant of his humor, and of the trouble he gives us, although he do not
appear to be above Nineteen year of age; I know all this well, answered
Pamphilus. Nevertheless let me speak to him, for I do assure you that my self
alone can appease him; and as it is a good work, from any body who has a
sickness to take away the pain, for some time, though it return again; So in
madness, it is a good work, to bring to pass, that he who has lost his wits
should recover them again though it were but for one hour.

Yet neither this reason, nor many other, served him to any purpose, for the
officers had already put manacles upon Nisa's hands; and the master, did
rigorously pull her to the Cage, although she had no need of this remedy, nor
any other, but the sight of Pamphilus. But as those who are accustomed to lie,
are seldom believed, although they say the truth: So in him who is mad, it is
accounted a token of greater madness, to seem wise. Thus Nisa was had away to
straight imprisonment, and Pamphilus standing ashamed, fearing that euory one
knew, what was privy only to himself, beheld her with abundance of tears; A
thousand times he was about to let go the reins of his passion, which his
understanding held in, and to be mad in reason, believing that if he were
mad, the chastisement of his madness, should be to remain with Nisa, which was
the greatest good he could hope for. And to begin his design, he offered
(against the Laws of this house) to break the gates of the Prison, and see
her by force: but hardly had he made any demonstration thereof, whenas the
Porters with the mad seruitors, (such as having recovered their wits, do serve
the others) fell upon him, and beating him cruelly, flung him into the street,
where (as the Fish whereof Aristotle speaks, which being drawn out of the
water, frames a humane voice and dies) he fetched a great figh and fell upon
the ground astonished.

The Sun was declined low toward the West, covering with gold and purple
that part of the Horizon, when Pamphilus returning out of his astonishment,
found himself in the arms of a young man, who having compassion of his
grief, encouraged him to recover life. Pamphilus looking steadfastly upon him,
with heavy sadness, demanded where he was? the young man told him, that he was
at the door of the Hospital, where the mad folks were kept. And how is it,
replied Pamphilus, that I am not within? because (said the other) thou
appearest, to be more diseased in body then in the passions of thy mind: Thou
iudgest by the countenance, (said Pamphilus) but if thou had seen my heart,
thou would rather judge that my evil proceeded from my spirit: True it is,
that the body feels also the pains of the mind; What kind of evil is thine
answered the young man, being so near the place, where evils of wounded minds
are cured? For if thou art not within the Hospital, thou desire (as it
seems) to be in, seeing thou do not deny thy evil; and thou confessest,
that it proceeds from thy mind, the passions whereof, are not far from
falling into that infirmity, which is cured in this place. The evil which I
have, (said Pamphilus) has a remedy in this house, and my misfortune is such,
that dispairing to cure me, they have flung me out. Thou can have no such
evil, answered the young man, but there is an Antidote to be found for it.
Incurable Love (said Pamphilus is groaning out a sigh) unto which all the
medicines and Herbs of Physic are improfitable. What is not Love to be
cured, answered the other? And are Auicens seven remedies of no force, and not
true? Of those said Pamphilus, and at the tales which Pliny writes, my passion
works; I only allow of his counsel, who advises chiefly to marry; but the
disposition of my fortune, and the rigorous influence of my stars, not only
do not suffer me, but makes it to me almost impossible. And although hope
sometime promises it unto me, yet I find that it is truly as Plato calls
it; The waking man his Dream: Love, then (said the young man) is the cause of
this habit which thou wearest, and of thy pilgrimage. It is so (said
Pamphilus) and by that thou may know the quality of my evil, and the
difficulty of my cure. Oh, said the young man pitifully sighing, what a
grievous story, do thou renew in me? A history like unto mine said Pamphilus;
if not said the other, yet at the least of Love; By thy faith (then said
Pamphilus) do thou love? I not only Love said the other, but am also more
unhappy then thou think for; a stranger and a Pilgrim, and no less outraged
by fortune. Tell me then said Pamphilus, (in looking earnestly upon him) thy
name and of what Country thou art; for in all the years of my banishment, I
could never find any man so miserably persecuted as my self: and in this, I
have more occasion, then all men to bewail my destinies. A Christian said the
stranger, ought never to bewail the destinies, nor think that good or evil
fortune depend of them: Although many ancient Philosophers have believed, that
there is a kind of Devils, and certain imaginary women which they call
Parquae, which give the spirit unto the creature at the birth, an opinon rather
worthy of laughter, then belief; It being most certain, that this name
Destiny, is only to be attributed to the decree of God, who truly sees and
knows all things before they be, and the ordering of them cannot depend of
any thing but of him; I know well said Pamphilus, that the Poets have called
these Parquaes destiny, and the Philosophers especially the Stoyques, have
believed that it is an order, or disposition of second causes, as from the
Planets under the influence of which we are borne, which rule and determine all
the inferior good and evil effects which do happen to man: So said Ptolomy,
Democritus, Crisippus, and Epicurus, who also ascribe to Destiny, all the
inclinations, the vices, and the virtues, the desires and passions even unto
the actions and thoughts, which some ha^^ endeavored to prove by the authority
of Boeceus, who says, that the order of Destiny moves the Heaven, and the
Stars tempereth the Elements, and tyeth humane actions to their causes by a
most indissolueable knot.

But leaving a part a matter of so long a discourse, from whence is sprung the
error of the Priscillianists, who do believe that the soul and the body, are
necessarily subject unto the Stars, and many other errors which do succeed
this first. I desire thou shoulst know, that I speak according unto custom,
which wills that this name Desteny, and other Christian Idiomes, be taken for
misfortune, believing that nevertheless, that God by his Divine providence
speaks by the Destiny as men express the conceptions of their minds by their
words. Thy face (says the young man) promises no less, then what I have
heard come from thy mouth; for thy presence and aspect is an index of thy
noblenes, as thy tongue is of knowledge: which works in me a great pleasure,
and desire to tell thee my Name, my Country, quality, and my misfortunes,
which if thou please to hearken unto with patience, I will as briefly as I can
relate.

The History of Pamphilus, and Celio.
THe City of Toledo, in the heart of Spain; strong by Situation, noble by
Antiquity, famous for the preservation of the Christian Faith, ever sithence
the time of the Goths, generous both in Learning and Arms, having a temperate
Heaven, and a fertile Earth, environed with the famous River Tagus, which is it
self also begirt with a high, but a pleasant Hill: Is the place where my now
living Parents were borne, as also my self, (although my Ancestors in former
times came from those parts of Austuria, which are called Santillana the
ancient title of the house of Mendosa) there was I brought up in my more tender
years: But when my Parents thought I was capable of Learning, they sent me to
the University of Salamanqua, with such company as was fit for a man of my
place, to the end that besides the Latin tongue which I knew already, I might
study the knowledge of the Law. Here I am constrained to make a long
digression, because that of the history of another, depends the foundation of
mine. My Father had other Children; Lisard his eldest son, who was in
Flaunders with the Archduke Albert, where he got no small reputation,
principally in the siege of Ostend, and Nisa a Daughter, and if I be not
partial, one of most excellent beauty, who lived in that honor and good name,
unto which she was bound, by the noblenes of her birth, and the care of such
Parents.

Unto these terms, was the youngman proceeded in his discourse, whereat
Pamphilus exceedingly troubled, covered his face with his hands, whereof the
other demanding a reason; Pamphilus said unto him, that his grief which had
brought him unto that estate wherein he found him was returned again, yet he
thought it was with less violence then it had formerly done. All this
Pamphilus feyned, because the story which the Toledan told him, was his own
proper story, and this Nisa whom he called his Sister, was the Pilgrim whose
wits were lost out of the apprehension of Pamphilus his Death; So do acts
dissembled many times meet, and sometimes do then appear most, when they are
most indeauoured to be hidden. I will not proceed in my story said he if thou
find not thy self so well, that thou may hearken unto me; for there is no
time worse employed then that which one loses in speaking to them, which give
no ear to the speaker; Thou may proceed said Pamphilus, (being desirous to
understand the estate of his own affairs) for I find my grief begins to
leave me, eased by thy presence and thy words; I must advertise thee then said
the young man, that there was in Madreele, a brave Knight, and a great friend
of my fathers, with whom he had great inwardnes of acquaintance, ever since
the wars of Granado, and I think they were together in that famous Battle
of Lepanto: from this friendship it followed, that at the end of some years,
they treated of the Marrying of my Sister Nisa, with one of this Knights
sons, of whom I now speak, and the young man's name was Pamphilus. But while
these things were a doing, the Father of Pamphilus dyed, and the proposition of
marriage ceased. Pamphilus who by the renown that went of my Sister, as also
by her Picture, was taken in her Love, and grew wonderful sad and melancholy,
and falling from one imagination to another, in the end he resolved upon this
which I shall tell thee, that thereby thou may see how innocent, those were,
who without the light of Faith, did anciently believe it Fortune and Destinies.
Which was, that making his Mother believe, that he would go into Flaunders,
and iourneying some days in the habit and equipage of a man at Arms, and
after sent his servants to Alcala of Henares, and there disguising himself in
other clothes, he went to Toledo: where not being known to any person, he
found means to be entertained as a servant in my fathers house, which was no
hard matter to do, because that his excellent feature and countenance,
accompanied with his understanding were pledges sufficient of his fidelity, and
gave my Father not only a desire to be served by him, but also to respect him.

My father received him, ignorant of his quality, and of his intent (a strange
imagination of a man, being a Knight, and so well known almost of all, in the
Country wherein he was borne; that he could so hide himself, at the Door (as
it were) of his own house, that no body could know, either where he was or
what he did:) yet so it was, that his humility, his diligent service, and
other commendable parts, which he had, gained such credit with my Parents,
that I do believe he might as easily have compassed his designs, with his
feigned poverty, as with his true riches.

The chiefest thing whereunto he applied himself as his whole study, was to
appear agreeable to Nisa, which was easy to be done, for who can guard
himself from a domesticke enemy? The simplicity wherewith this Knight did
begin his treason, and the good words which he used, gained him entrance into
those places, whereinto hardly and with great difficulty, could the ancient
servants come. Behold with how little care, a noble Gentleman kept in his
house, another Greek horse, like unto miserable Troy: For such of necessity
must this young man's heart needs be, full of thoughts and armed with malice,
which (the hour of execution approaching) brake forth into such flames, as
have fired our renown. When Pamphilus thought that Nisa was disposed to
hearken to his intention, were it that his sickness were true, or fained; as
most likely it was, he made himself sick. My parents, who accounted of this
servant as of their governor, and loved him equal with their dearest Children,
there being no key about the house, no account in all their expense, nor any
secret in their affairs, wherein he was not trusted: caused him to be tended
with all the care which was possible for love and respect to bring. The
Physicians said, that this infirmity proceeded from a deep melancholy, and the
best remedy that was to be given, was to rejoice him, and principally by
Music; In which they were not deceived, for if Love do participate of the
evil spirit, and that David drove away the evil spirit from Saul by the
sweetness of his Harp, by the same means Love might be driven away. Thou
say true, said Pamphilus, (who gave great attention unto the relation of his
own story, to see to what end the discourse of this youngman would come, who
was his Mistresses Brother) for without doubt it holds many conditions of the
evil spirit, and leaving a part the principal which is to torment with fire,
behold the simpathy which they have one with the other. The Devils do delight
themselves in things which are naturally melancholy, inhabiting in horrible
places, obscure and solitary, as loving darkness and sadness: All which
qualities are common with them which Love, and cannot attain to that which
they pretend, they desire solitary places, and the dens of Deserts, there to
entertain in silence their sad thoughts, without any thing to trouble them, no
not the light of heaven. But let me entreat thee to proceed, in thy story of
this Knight, for I desire with passion to know the end.

My Sister Nisa, said Celio, then (for so was the young man called) could play
admirable well of the Lute, and sung so sweetly that in the like danger, the
Dolphin would willinglier have brought her to the shore, then he did Arion
sometimes to Corinth. Wherefore by the consent of my Parents, and not against
her will; she went into Pamphilus his little Chamber, (Consider with thy self
the happy glory of a man in his case) and sung a Poem which he himself had
composed, for he had that way a dexterious facility, and very natural,
neither did it want the excellency of Art. But whilst Nisa sung, Pamphilus
wept, and never turned his eyes from of hers; So that one resembled the
Crocadile, and the other Sirene, unless that one sung to give him health, and
the other wept to deceive her of her honor. Nisa seeing this his extremity of
sadness, said unto him; that her intent was not that her music should have the
same effect in him as it had in others, which is, to make them more sad, which
are any way heavy, but contrarily, her desire was to rejoice him. There is
(answered he) no other voice nor other harmony, unless it may be the harmony
of Heaven, can rejoice me but yours: Nevertheless my evil being past hope of
cure, binds me to bewail my self, and not to think upon any thing, but
upon the beauty which causes it; What evil is that (said Nisa) past cure,
which proceeds from a cause commended by thee? It is an evil (answered
Pamphilus) whereof I do hinder the cure, and whereof the only comfort is to
know, that I suffer it, for the fairest creature in the world. The liberty
wherein we live (said Nisa) does give me leave Pamphilus, to speak unto thee
here of a suspicious matter: by the tokens which thou have delivered unto me
of thy evil, thou have given me knowledge of the occasion that makes thee
sick, although I am ignorant of the cause, who makes thee sick: Thou love
without doubt, and I take it in good part, that thou would confess unto me,
that, which thou would not speak unto the Physicians, assuring thee, that
thou may better trust my Love then their Art. But I conjure thee, by that
goodwill which thou know I have born thee ever since thou have served my
Parents, that thou will tell me whether I know her whom thou love, and
whether I can be helpful unto thee in thy curing, for thy tears do make me
pity thee. You may well serve to help me pitiful Nisa, (said then the
cunning Lover, who might well have instructed Ovid) seeing I do not hope for
it from any other hands then yours, and that you know the cause of my pain,
as well as you know your self.

Here Pamphilus demanded of Celio (wondering that be should tell so
perticularly, that which passed so secretly between him and Nisa) how he knew
the same words which they had spoken, he being at that time a far off,
following his study in Salamanqua? To which Celio answered, that the same
Pamphilus had left the story in writing with a friend of his, from whom having
had the means since that time to get it, he learned all unto the least
particular, and then proceeding on his discourse, he began in this manner.

The color which came into Nisa's face when she heard Pamphilus his words,
cannot be compared, but unto the red Rose, with milken leaves, although it be
a Poetical term, and borrowed of the same author, yet feyning not to
understand what he said, she answered, that if it were any of her friends she
would endeavor (at the least) to bring it about that she should know his
evil, that thereupon he might lay the foundation of his remedy. I am in that
estate said Pamphilus that I dare not so much as sigh or breath out her name,
yet I can show you her portrature, who is the original cause of my misfortune,
and for whose sake, I am come from my own Country into yours, where I remain
an humble servant of your house, and do think my self most happy to be so,
although I am a Knight, and equal unto her, whom you call your friend, and
with whom I should have bin now married, if my Father had lived until this
day, for only his Death barred me of this happiness. And in saying these
words, Pamphilus gave her, her Picture, which had bin drawn by the most
excellent Painter of our time, called Philip of Lianho; whose pensill
oftentimes durst compare with Nature herself, who out of mere envy unto him,
for that, (as it seemed) shortened his days. Yet Nisa (through whose veins ran
a cold shiuering) affirmed, that she did not know the face; I do not wonder
said Pamphilus, that the ancient Philosopher has delivered his opinion; that
it is a very hard matter to know ones self. Putting this sentence; Know thy
self; in the fronts of the most famous Temples. Yet see another more natural,
the knowledge whereof you cannot deny. Saying this, he reached her a very fair
looking-glass: Nisa seeing her face within the Crystal, could no longer
suffer his discourse, nor the Knights presence: But rising up in collor, said
unto him in great anger as she went away, thy boldness shall cost thee thy life.
Can it be better employed answered Pamphilus, then for your beauty to be ended?

She answered well, said the Pilgrim, if she had accomplished what she said.
She accomplished it so ill replied Celio, that within a few days she loved
him, better then she loved herself, proving the Verse of the famous Poet Dant
to be infallibly true; that Love excuses no one who is beloved from loving.
But how came it (said the Pilgrim) that a Maid should Love; who had harkened
with so much disdain in the beginning? Because answered Celio, that all Mayds
for their first answer consult with shame, and for their second consult with
weakness: Although for my own part, I think that Pamphilus dispairing of his
remedy helped himself with charms. I cannot believe so, answered Pamphilus, a
man has liberty to Love, and not to love as it seems good unto himself, and
it seems to be a terrible and cruel thing that a chaste woman should be
violently constrained to Love, whether she would or no: Charms and
witchcrafts, may peradventure move, persuade, and tempt, without suffering to
be in rest, and with these exterior persuasions make one yield unto the
prayers and tears of a Lover: Yet for all this it cannot be said, that she is
constrained but that of her good will, she gives consent to her desire,
suffering her self rather to be vanquished by her own proper nature, then by
the force of any Art Magic. Wherefore it is an evident folly, in those which
Love, to complain that they are violently constrained, will they nill they, to
follow their Loves, because God never suffeteth that the po^er of free will
should be taken from Man; and if any one say he has bin forced by
Diabolical persuasions, it may be answered, he was not forced in his reason,
but in his concupiscence: Neither is it to be believed, that a Knight, a
Christian, wise, young and brave Gentleman, would help himself with such
wicked means to attain his ends. It is not likely, answered Celio, and it may
be, that he witnessing his fidelity by other services, obliged her to
condescend unto his will, for Nisa is not the only woman in this world subject
to this weakness.

Nevertheless behold the strange accident, which happened unto them both, as a
beginning of their misfortunes; for it being spoken at Madreele, that Pamphilus
was come from Flanders, the news thereof came unto my Fathers ears, who
(desirous to make him his Son in Law, in favor of the ancient acquaintance and
love he had with his Father, and because that it had been formerly agreed
between them) one day told her, that he was resolved to Marry her, not
naming unto whom; and thereupon writing to Madreele, to Pamphilus his Mother,
entreating her to send him to Toledo, congratulating also with her, her Sons
happy return and the prosperous success of his affairs, and remembered unto
her the amity which he had contracted with her husband, his Father. The sad
Nisa, who already desperately loved Pamphilus, told him, that her Father would
marry her, and the Knight who was designed for her Husband, was shortly to come
from Madreele unto their house, but she knew nothing in particular more of
him, but that he was a brave Soldier who lately came out of Flanders. Pamphilus
(ignorant that he was the person who was meant) fell into great extremity at
the news, and after many tears and other follies, he said, he was resolved
to be gone, for his heart would never suffer him to see a new servant unto his
Mistress in this house. A strange and never heard of story, that a man should
be jealous of himself, and fly from his own presence. Nisa who now thought
it as impossible for her to be without Pamphilus, as the Earth without water,
Fire without matter to burn, or as the Celestial harmony without their first
mouer; said unto him in weeping, that she would have him take her away with
him, and that she would follow him over the world; yet upon this condition,
that he should swear solemnly, never to loose the respect which was due unto
her honor: which oath being taken by Pamphilus without any consideration of
the danger which might happen: he made choice of a dark night, and by a Garden
which answers upon the Riner, took her from the house, and by the same river
went from the Town, carrying her in his Bark, until he came unto those
Mountains which are called Stsla: This was it which he writ afterward from
Valence, to a friend of his of Saragossa.

Now follows the beginning of my peregrination, which (having bin to long in
this History) I will briefly relate. At the dolourous Letter which was written
to me of this success, (which was discovered, so soon as Pamphilus was gone
from Toledo) I came from Salamanqua to my fathers house, which I found all in
mourning for the loss of my Sister. My Father in few words obliged me to
revenge it, which I swore that I would, with many words as free, as his were
grave: and to execute my intent I went to Madreele. I sought Pamphilus in all
the houses of his friends, and visited his Mother, asking news of him, making
show how things had passed. The innocent Mother said, it was two years since
he went into Flaunders, and that from the time of his departure, she never had
heard from him, from whence she collected he was dead. I thought that she,
knowing what he had done, had disguised the truth: and while I was in this
meditation, I casting my eyes upon a young Gentlewoman, who sat sowing by this
reverend matron, I found her in my mind so fair, that her only look, had
power to temper my sorrow, and hardly had I fully viewed her perfections, when
as I propounded in my self to serve her, and to steal her away, thinking by
this means to give satisfaction to our honor, and beginning to my revenge. To
recount unto you at this time all the passages, and the care which I used to
speak with her, and to bring her to my will, would be to trouble you with a
long discourse; Let it satisfy, that I drew her from her house with the same
thread, where with Pamphilus had pulled Nisa from ours, and in a strange and
foolish mind led her into France, where her beauty ministered subject unto a
Knight to serve her, and for me to kill him: From whence it followed, that for
safety of my life I was driven to leave her. Nevertheless, I am resolved
whatsoever happen unto me, to go seek her, because that besides, I do love
her more then my self, I owe so much unto her merit and virtue, with which
she has faithfully accompanied me, thorough many and variable successes.

Night had spread his black veil over the face of the Earth, and the houses
were full of Candles, as the Heaven of stars; men and creatures retired
themselves, from their common labor, when as the miserable Pamphilus gave over
hearing the tragedy of his Love, with the last act of his honor: and to know
that he did then but begin to suffer his evils, when he thought he was at an
end of them, He admired the justice of Heaven, which had suffered that his
Sister should so lightly have quited her Mothers house, to run away with a
man; Yet finding in himself the example of his own misleading of Nisa, and
that the injury which he had done unto Celio, was no less then that which he
had received; he did not hold it just in himself, once to think of revenge,
but rather to persuade him that he should not, nor ought to leave her, which
he performed with the best words, and the liueliest reasons he could devise.
Remonstrating unto him, that amongst Gentlemen, the only condition of
noblenes, should bind him to go seek for her, which Celio allowing for most
reasonable, gave him his word, to employ his endeauours to that purpose. And
being lodged this night together, they supped and slept in one house. The next
morning Pamphilus gave him a Letter to a French Gentleman, with whom he had
great acquaintance, that he might favor him in finding out Finia, for so was
his Sister called. But Celio departed not for certain days, during which time
there was a perfect friendship knit between those two secret enemies; So that
Pamphilus knowing the offense which Celio had done unto him, pardoned him in
his heart, and Celio ignorant that this was Pamphilus, was disposed to the
pardoning of him. The resolution was with great oaths to enquire out one the
other, and to help each other in all accidents as Brothers; assigning the
rende-vous within six months, in the City of Pamphelune.

So went Celio upon his enterprise; and some few days after his departure,
Pamphilus his sorrow increasing out of the opinion that it was impossible for
him to recover Nisa; It happened that going one night from his lodging, in a
vain desire he had to see the windows of the Prison (where his happiness and
joy was enclosed) he heard a Knight cry out for help against some who would at
advantage have killed him. He suddenly stepped unto him, and drawing out his
Sword out of his Palmers staff with an incredible dexterity, accompanied with
a valiant and brave courage, made them loose him, whom they would have killed,
and save their own lives by a shameful, though a safe flight.

The Knight would needs know what he was, who had delivered him from so great
danger: and although Pamphilus excused himself from telling his name, yet the
Knights desire, and courtesy prevailed more, then the humblenes wherewith the
Pilgrim did endeavor to persuade him, that he had done him no service: to
conclude, he led him to his house, where his good and gentle behavior being
observed, the Knight and his Parents bare such affection unto him, that they
did oblige him to become their guest.

There remained Pamphilus some days, at the end of which, Iacinth (so was this
Knight called) told him the history of his Love, unto fair Lucinde, and the
occasion for which these assassiuators would have murdered him, who, for this
only cause, were come from Civil unto Valence, where the subject of the
passion, and the sorrow wherein he lived did remain. I do believe that Lovers
have some simpathy one with another, and that they join and communicate, in
such manner as you have seen in this discourse. Seeing that our Pilgrim never
came into any house, where there was not some one, or other tainted with this
evil, although it were in craggy Mountains.

By this ouerture of Iacinthes secret, Pamphilus was bound to discover his: and
after he had made him swear, that he would grant him his request, he said;
that in recompense of his life, which he had saved, as he himself confessed,
he coniured him, to help him to a place, in that Prison where the mad solkes
were shut up. Iacinth astonished at so strange a request, would needs know the
cause. But Pamphilus promising to tell him so soon as he had done him that
favor, and casting himself at his feet with most earnest and vnheardof
words, affirming the good he should do him, to put him in this place: made
Iacinth suspect, that some secret danger did enforce him into that place. And
willing very generously to satisfy the obligation wherein he was tied, after
some inconveniences and reasons urged to divert him, having agreed with him of
the means which he should hold, This very night Iacinth took five or six
men of the Hospital, who entering suddenly into Pamphilus his Chamber, put him
in a Chair, and carried him away in their arms: miserable condition of this
man, who after so many strange successes, being wise (if those who Love can be
so) to make himself to be taken and shut up willingly, as a madman, where
all the mad folks would willingly be accounted wise.

All Iacinthes house admire at this nouelty, and all his family complain that
this stranger, unto whom Iacinth was redeuable for his life, was so unworthily
requited by Iacinth himself: But she who most complained of his cruelty, and
had the truest feeling of it, was Tiberia his Sister, who was both fair and
discreet above all the Ladies in Valence, who affecting the gentleness, and
fair spirit of our unfortunate Pilgrim, did not see but by his eyes, and did
not breath but from him. Iacinth told them that Pamphilus was mad, and that it
was necessary he should be cured before the disease increased too far. The
Father of this Knight, who was very Learned, blamed exceedingly this precipite
course, saying that in all infirmities, there was nothing more dangerous, then
Physic out of season, and swore that he should be had out of the Hospital,
to be cured in his house. Tiberia confirmed this piety, saying; that reward
due unto him, they being not so poor, but that they had means sufficient, to
have him cured in their house, with greater care of his health, and less
scandal to his honor. Iacinth replied, that he was a Stranger, and that no
body knew him. But all the household were so much against him, blaming him for
ingratitude, especially his Father, and his Sister, that he was constrained to
tell them what he knew. Whereat in imagining the cause, all of them were
astonished and wondered. They thought that Pamphilus was a spy, who went
disguised under the habit of a Pilgrim, and that fearing to be known by some
one, he used this subtilty to save his life: for although he spoke Spanish,
nevertheless, by his fair face and exceeding beauty, he seemed a stranger,
and by his actions a Gentleman. With this confession, Iacinth remained in their
good opinion, the house was much troubled, and Tiberia was full of pitiful
grief and care for Pamphilus his life: who being in Prison among the mad
folks (in the judgment of many, the very center of greatest misery) imagined
himself to be in most glorious happiness.

To this new Madman, the more ancient gave place, and Pamphilus, with diverse
faynings and counterfetings of his face, endeavored to express his madness;
which fashion of his, seeming unto them as tokens of rashness, they put him into
the Prison with Irons on his hands, where to confirm them the more in their
opinion of his madness, he said so many words so far from the matter, that
he did merit a belief. There he stayed some few days before he could see
his beloved Nisa, suffering most insupportable discommodities, difficult to be
spoken, and almost impossible to be believed; In the mean time Celio went by
Saragosse into France, to find his beautiful and beloved Finia whom he had
lost, where being come, he heard the news of the Peace which was proclaimed,
between the two Nations, which made him rest that night (with more contentment
out of the facility which it brought to his design) staying for the Light of
the morning, to clear his passage over the Mountains into France.

The end of the Second Book.
The Third Book.
Whilst the sad and afflicted Celio entered into France by the Mountains of
Iaca to see if he could find his dear Finia; our Pilgrim Pamphilus having
gotten out of the Prison, as a mad man whose fury was over, was admitted to the
table where others did eat, where also sat his saire Nisa; near unto whom he
did always endeavor to sit, and there and in all other convenient places, he
told her his Fortunes. She blamed him for putting himself into this place,
although she did acknowledge how she was tied unto him, for this his great
folly.

Pamphilus as a true I over, who only aimed at the end of his love, which was
to Marry her, and who had sworn by a thousand oaths, to resist the violence
of his desires, until a lawful marriage would suffer him to accomplish them:
said unto her in comforting her, that if she had suffered this misery for him,
and that they ought to be all one, there was no reason but he should have his
part of this misery, to the end that equal in all things, their marriage
might be, without advantage of one side or other, and that his Love unto her
did prevail so far as not to let pass one day, without seeing her,
notwithstanding any danger, and although his honor were thereby in hazard. The
servants of the house did not hinder their speaking together, because that Nisa
being apparelled like a man, and having a care that her hair should not
discover her sex, every body did believe that she was as she seemed to be.
For although that her beauty were extreme, yet the world has not any so
great, but it appears little, being much neglected; especially seeing, that
if Art do not polish the beautifullest and finest Diamonds, and that they be
not set in gold with inamilling, and other necessary ornaments, they show not
the luster, grace nor beauty, which they have being artificially cut and set in
a foil by cunning workmen.

The misery of this kind of life, seemed unto our two Lovers as nothing in
regard of the former travels which they had suffered, as I have heard it often
said by many: and I my self know by experience that if two Lovers may see, and
speak together, they have no feeling of the miseries, which do serve them as
means to attain thereunto. Oh what will not those which Love resolve of! What
is it, which does not seem possible unto them? Whar travels can weary them?
And what dangers can make them fear? O Love strong as death: seeing that a
Lover living in that which he loves, and being dead in himself, has no more
feeling of torment then a body deprived of a soul. With what tears were these
two separated at night, by the cruel officers of this Prison? (If it be
cruelty to deal rigorously with mad folks) with what care and languishment
did they attend the day, that they might see one the other? what discreet
follies did they utter in public, full of equivocations to deceive those who
heard them, and to divert the evils which they suffered? And with what amorous
discourses did they in particular warm their desires to marry? How much does
he commend Nisa's virtue, and the chaste, but loving defense which she made of
her honor, for Pamphilus being a man had yielded often unto his passion, if
she had not moderated his violence. With what grace they gave madly, favors
one unto another, of the vildest things they could find upon the ground,
which Pamphilus stuck in his hat, in steed of Jewels or feathers, which he was
wont to wear: But fortune envying their contentednes, even in this misery,
would not let them live in this place at rest, but arming himself a new
against them, even at that time when as they thought (by Iacinthes help) to
get out of that Prison, There came unto this City an Italian Earl, of the
house of Anquilora called Emelio, who desiring to have a Fool with him,
promised a great Alms unto their house, if they would give him a madman, who
having lost his fury might entertain him with sport. Those of the Hospital
sailed not to promise him one, and withal to bring him to his lodging some of
their most peaceable madmen, amongst whom, were the Pilgrim Pamphilus and the
fair Nisa. The Earl joyful to see them, inquired of their bringers their
conditions? one of whom answered thus:

This man strong and able who you see there, was sometimes a brave Soldier, who
having served upon many occasions like a Hector, desired the reward of his
valor which he had meritted above all other. But he finding himself denied,
and that it was given unto the cowardliest fellow in the Army: fell from this
imagination into so profound a melancholy, that he lost his wits. He has lost
his fury in the Prison although oftentimes it returns. His discourse is
always of Marshalling an Army, of besieging a Fort, of lodging a Camp, or
causing it to march. All is Sluices, Dikes, Trenches, Platformes, Rauelins,
Cassamats, Flanckers, Pallisadoes, Counterscarfes, Squadrons, Cannons, Muskets,
Pistols, Corselets, Pikes. This weak and pale man, is of another humor, who
having given himself too much to the study of Philosophy, lost his
understanding. Of this man the Earl demanded which was the Primum mobile,
either Coelum Imperium, or Coelum Christalinum? unto whom the madman answered
thus:

After the moving Sphaeres by a local motion, the Divines do teach us, that
there is another Heaven perpetually in rest from all motion, created from the
beginning, and full of an innumerable thousands of intelligences, and of happy
spirits, which were created together in it, and with it. In such sort as the
mingled bodies are accustomed to engender some things in inferior places, as
Fishes in the water, Birds in the air, and the vegitatiue creatures, Plants
and Minerals in the earth. This Heaven for the greatness, and for the
inestimable light, for which it is called Imperial, as who should say Fiery
(not for the natural property of Fire, but for the glorious cleernesse
wherewith it shines) is the Throne destined before the constitution of the
world, and as a Royal palace ordained from the beginning, for all those who
are to reign before the face of God, the light whereof is so lustrous and
clear, that the corporal eyes cannot behold or look upon it, no more then
the Birds of the night can the Sun.

All the assistants remaining astonished at this discourse, one other of the
madmen began to cry, calling his Dogs, and lewring his Hawks, like a great
Fauconer and Huntsman as he had been; of whom, as the Earl began to laugh,
Pamphilus said thus unto him; you ought not mock at this exercise, but at
those who exercise it unorderly and untimely, without respecting either season
or place: For according to Xenephon and Athaneus, Hunting was famous amongst
the Persians. Homer says, it was practiced amongst the Greeks, that thereby
their Young men might become more hardy; For as Horace writes, the Hunter
often lies abroad in the cold night, without remembering his wife. Philon the
Hebrew tells notable things of Hunting, in his Preface unto his warfare.
Cicero says no less, in his book of The nature of the Gods. And Peter Gregory
says, that the original thereof, was in the beginning of the world, to the end
that men should be able to free themselves from the persecutions of Beasts. If
Hunting replied the Earl, (who was a man of great knowledge) had not passed
from the honest exercise, (the imitation of war) unto that of pleasure, who
would doubt of the excellency thereof? but in regard of the hurt it does in the
fields, and the expense which it brings unto him who follows it? Jews the
twelfth King of France justly forbad it: For what else is the meaning of the
fable of Acteon, devoured by his Dogs, but that overmuch Hunting wastes both
goods and life? And passing by many other things, which might be gathered from
this Verse of Virgill, Where he says, Eneas and sad Dido went a hunting
together in a Wood: Joined also the dangers of life which cannot be told,
neither is it to be wondered at, that this man became mad, seeing that as Dion
assures the same exercise made the Emperor Adrian a fool. Then answered the
mad Hunter, that with more reason should he be laid in this place for a
madman, because he would persuade madmen, and reason with them who had no
reason.

The discourse of this madman, says the Earl savoring nothing of madness;
obliges me to answer: For a man must fight with those who give occasion, play
with such as have money, and answer unto every one in the same manner he
speaks. But if all the madmen in Spain, were as you, and that my Children
should remain there, I should rather desire to have them ignorant then Learned;
Know said the Fool that if it were possible a man should desire to be borne in
France to live in Italy, and to dye in Spain, to be borne for the noblenes of
the French, who always have had their King of their own Nation, and never
mingled with any other; To live, for the liberty and felicity of Italy: And to
dye; for the Catholic Faith which is so certain in all Spain. And as
concerning your Children, whatsoever happens of it, suffer them not to live in
Ignorance; For there is less danger in being mad, then in being ignorant.
Whilst this man spoke, another singing near unto him, let the Earl know
that Music had brought him to that estate, for it is said; that it is a
kinswoman unto Poetry: The ancients said the madman, have comprised Music
amongst the Liberal Sciences. Aristotle in his Politiques, Budeus in his
Commentary upon the Greek tongue, and Cealio the Rodian, do say, that Music
is a mixture compounded of sounds sweet, flat and sharp. Plutarque in the life
of Homer, puts one voice flat, and the other sharp, the flat voice
proceeds from within, and the sharp from the superfices of the mouth, and
from their diverse tempering makes the harmony; the object of the hearing is
the sound, and the reflection of the air; as Galen teaches; and the sound is
made from the act of some one thing into another, by the means of the stroke
which causes it: two bodies are required to make a sound, because that one
cannot do it. The Echo is an air struck into hollow places, which resisting
the stroke of the voice, returns the same words which are spoken. So say
Themiserus, Pliny, Ovid, and Macrobius in his Saturnales. The voice and the
word are not one thing, the word holds the ground from the Tongue helped by
the Nostrils, the Lips and the Teeth: and the instruments of the Voice are the
Throat, the Mustles which move, and the Nerves which come down from the
Brain.

Who was the first inuenter of Music, asked the Earl? The madman answered,
Josephus says, that it was Thuball, Adams nephew, although that others give
the invention to Mercury, as Gregory Gerand: and Philostratus says, that
Mercury learned it of Orpheus, Orpheus of Amphion. But Eusebius attributes it
unto Father Dionisius. Then asked the Earl into how many parts Music was
divided? The madman answered, according unto Boethius, into the Theorique and
the Practique, be it either Natural, Artificial, Celestial or humane; The
Natural and Celestial, is that which is considered in the harmony of all the
parts of the world: the Humane is that which treats of the proportions of the
body and of the soul, and their parts: For Plato, Pithagoras, and Architas,
have thought, that the motions and conuersions of the Stars, cannot be
without Music: And Vitruuius is of that opiuion, that buildings are not
framed without Music. Leaving Celestial and humane, there follows
Artificial divided into musical Organs and Instruments.

Thereupon the other madmen began to put in practice, that whereof he only
showed the Theorique, and began to make such a noise with confused, and
discording voices, that it was impossible to understand them. But being
appeased, he who kept the madmen, made great account unto the Earl, of a mad
Astrologian, who by the contemplation of such high things was fallen into this
abasement. Hardly had the Earl looked upon him, when he began to tell him,
that the composition, and figure of the world, In its form was called a
Sphaere which was sollid, and that passing alive through the middle, the Poles
were placed in the extremes or vertical points immouable: one made the North
on this side of the Bear, and from the Stars of that part of Heaven called
Aquilon, Boreall, or Artique; The other which was opposite by Diamiter was
called Antartique and Meridionall; There was he interrupted by others, who
would not let him proceed, and after it was not possible to appease them,
although there were a great many more, Painters, Poets, and Mathematicians, but
above all, there was an Alcumist, a famous Disciple of Ramond Lullius.

At this time Emilius had fixed his eyes upon Nisa, and beholding the sadness,
with which she was silent, he demanded of the Master the humor of this mad
creature? who answered him, that Love had brought him to his folly, her
delicate face, and the occasion of her evil, gave him at the same time, desire
and compassion with such affection, that agreeing with the Master, at the price
of a hundred Crowns, he made choice of her from amongst all the other to
lead her into Italy; But hardly had Pamphilus seen the effects of his
election, when as his fury increasing truly, which was before but fained, he
struck, he bit, and took on, as if he had been enraged, against those who
took his dear Nisa away. But they being a great many against him alone, the
Earl took her from the house, and shortly after from Valence. And Pamphilus
tied up as a madman, was had back again with many grievous blows, bewayling
bitterly the loss of his dear Nisa. And by how much he indeauoured, to make
the Officers believe that he was not mad, by so much the more he persuaded
them, that he was not well in his wits: Because being oppressed with grief he
told them plainly, that he had caused himself to be brought thither, only
to see this young mad creature, whom they had accounted to be a man, but
indeed was a Woman and his wife, whom he had concealed under this habit, for
fear of her Father, from whom he had stolen her away.

But they were so confirmed in their opinion of his madness, that by those
reasons, whereby he did think they were tied to give him his liberty, he
made them more obstinate to refuse him, until they might have more evident
tokens of the tranquillity of his mind. Whilst he did complain to see that
it served him to no purpose to tell the truth, which of all things in the
world does most inrage a man, and that in regard of Iacinthes absence, he could
not tell unto whom to have recourse: The unfortunate Nisa was come to Barcelon,
with so much sorrow and tears, that Emilio already repented that he had
bought her: In as much as there is nothing more unprofitable then a sad Fool.
The Earl embarked, not knowing that she whom he led with him had the fortune
of Scianus Horse, which cost his Masters their lives: He indeauoured to rejoice
Nisa, causing her to sit at his Table, to make her eat meat, because it was
told him, that she would famish her self to death, where earnestly beholding
her face, and considering her actions, he did suspect, that she was neither
mad, nor a man: He let this day pass over, and the next day he was assured of
both; In as much as so great a sadness could not be feigned; And that Nisa's
reserved speech, and the modesty of her looks declared openly that which upon
other occasions, she had covered with so much care; Emilio being then persuaded
that this mad creature was a Woman, or at the least having evident tokens
thereof, inquired with great care of her sadness? using her as a Gentlewoman, and
with respect due unto her sex. Nisa who had now neither care to disguise
herself nor to live, confessed she was a woman, and would not be comforted by
Emilio's words: But Emilio, who the more he conuersed with her, the more was
engaged in her Love; in the end suffered himself to be vanquished in her
beauty: for Nisa now ceasing to appear as a man captiuated all those who
beheld her, with her maruailous grace. Love then began to make himself master
over Emilio through pity, which is the cloak under which it enters into our
minds; as the Pill under gold, that the bitterness may not offend: and his
passion increased so far, as to desire to know her evil, and to procure her
remedy. But neither for any effect of Love, nor hope of remedy that he could
give her, would Nisa witness any feeling of pleasure, or obligation to him: all
which served to sharpen Emilios desires, which he did make appear with
greater demonstrations: whereat Nisa being grieved, endeavored to divert him
from her Love, coniuring him with tears, that he would not lead her in this
indecent habit. The Earl being courteous, offered her other clothes, but she
assured him, that she had made a vow never to were any but Pilgrims of this
fashion, until she had seen the Patron of Spain in Galicia. Emilio
nevertheless did make her one of Serge in the same Golle, for Serge, and Taylers
are never wanting, few men coming into such places, who do not quickly prove
Taylers. So the Pilgrim being new clothed appeared more beautiful, there
being no new apparel which does not imbellish; nor so poor a habit new,
which does not enrich a well proportioned body.

But by this time, a great fogge with a tempestious wind arising in the gulf,
the Marryners knew by the signs, which are wont to fore-runne such storms,
that they were likely to undergo a great hazard of drowning. Their presage was
not vain, for the wind rise with such extremity and violence, and the Sea
wrought with such huge Billoes, that the Masters could no more command, nor
the Rowers abay. The Captain was astonished, the Pilot pale, some cried,
others silent and without stirring, remained as men in a Trance with fear. And
in this confusion, which continued six hours, the miserable Galley split
against the Rocks; Emilio who now no more remembered his Love, and who knew not
that the vnfortunatenes of Nisa brought forth this effect, (clean contrary
unto Caesar's Fortune, which appeased storms) indeauoured to save his life with
much travail: And the Heaven reserving Nisa's life to run greater fortunes,
cast her as formerly she had been upon the shore of Barcelon.

Those which remained alive, were cast away in the same place: Nisa having
stayed some time to recover herself after this fortune, went in Pilgrimage to
Marselles: where one day visiting the famous Temple of the Penitent, whom the
Angels buried in the Mountain, where God gave his Laws to Moses, she saw a
woman a Pilgrim as herself, though in other habit, who with great Devotion
was upon her knees, at the stayres of the great Altar: She appeared unto Nisa
to be a Spaniard, wherefore desiring better to inform herself, obliged
thereunto, by her love unto the Country, she stayed at the Gate, whereat
(when having done her devotions) she came forth, and Nisa saluting her, they
both knew that they were Castelians: their joy was so great, that it had been
confirmed by imbracings, if the man's apparel which Nisa wore, had not hindered
it: by little and little they went apart, that they might speak more freely,
and with less fear of the French, who already began to behold their beauties:
and being placed under a Rock which was adjoining unto the Sea, Nisa said thus
unto her, of what Province are you fair Spaniard? of the Kingdom of Toledo
(answered the Pilgrim) and of the greatest City, having merited to lodge the
Kings for many years: you are then of Madreele, replied Nisa, and so we are
here met by chance two Pilgrims of one Country, for I am also of Toledo. Then
said the Pilgrim, fetching a great sigh: There was borne the cause of my
peregrination, and of my misfortune. It is easy to be seen in thy youth and
in thy beauty, that Love has brought you into these parts; and if it be of a
Gentleman of whom thou do complain, I believe I know him. It may be so said
the Pilgrim of Madreele, and believe me so soon as I saw you I was abashed,
because you have the very countenance of my enemy; you wish me evil by all
circumstance, then said Nisa: rather all good replied the Pilgrim; for all that
resembles his body is agreeable unto me, only I complain of the cruelty of
his mind; will you not tell me his name or his Parents, said Nisa? I hazard a
small matter in telling thee that, answered she; For contrariwise I gain thus
much, that it seems unto me I am quiet and at peace, having seen thee, which
since I lost him never came unto me before now. His name is Celio, and the name
of a Sister which he has is Nisa, which are the best tokens I can give thee,
to make him known unto thee; because besides, that she is famous for her
beauty, she is also more famous for her disgrace. Nisa remained astonished to
hear her own name, and her brother Celios (for this Pilgrim was Finia,
Pamphilus his Sister, who had bin left in France, as you have already heard)
wherefore she desired earnestly to know the particular of this story, which
Finia related in the same manner as Celio* had done unto Pamphilus. In the City
of Valence, accusing his jealousy, which had made him cruelly kill a French
Gentleman, from whose death ensued his absence, and all the miseries and
travels which she had since endured; Nisa dissembling that part which she had
in the story, blamed the cruelty of her brother Celio, and with the
contentment, which she received in seeing Pamphilus his Portraiture, in Finia
her beauty, she tempered her grief for his absence, and her sorrow which she
had, that both their Parents should loosetheir Children for one cause: then did
she tell her that she knew Pamphilus, and that it was not long since she saw
him, assuring her (as one verily believing) that he was in Spain: Finia
demanded of Nisa how she knew him, and where it was that she had seen him?
And Nisa because she would not discover herself, told her, that she had known
him at Constantinople, where they had been both Slaves together: Finia bursting
into tears, embraced Nisa, and coniured her to tell her name, and the story of
her Brother if she knew it: Nisa answered, that Pamphilus himself had
heretofore in his captivity told it unto her, and that she would willingly
recount it unto her: but first, she deceived Finia in telling her, that her
name was Felix, and that going from Toledo with a Captain, who embarked in
Carthagena, they had been made Captives in passing to Oran, and afterward had
to Argier, where a Turk of Constantinople had bought her. And so following the
story of Pamphilus which was also hers, from the beginning as you have heard
related by Celio until their departure from Toledo, she began to say, as
follows.

Here follows the Story of Pamphilus and Nisa.
AFter that Pamphilus went away from Toledo with Nisa, thinking that her Father
would marry her with another, and being jealous of himself, he told me that
suffering some of those discommodities, which do offer themselves unto such
men, as travail without their lawful Wives, they came unto Civil a
beautiful City, if the Sun do shine upon any, for riches, greatness,
magnificence, policy, haven, and staple of the Indyes: where it may be said,
that twice every year, there enters the substance of all Spain. There would
Pamphilus enjoy the beautyes of Nisa; but she disconted, that he lost the
respect which he was accustomed to bear to her Chastity, against the Oath
which he had solemnly sworn, hid himself for some days out of his sight,
during which time, he ready to grow mad; yet finding her again, and craving
pardon with new Oaths to keep the first inuiolably, they were friends again.

But Pamphilus being one day at the Market place, he was known by a Merchant
of Toledo, a great friend unto Nisa her Father, who going about to lay hands on
him and apprehend him, Pamphilus was enforced to lay hand upon his Sword, to
defend himself from the Justice. It happened well for Pamphilus, whose courage
and address in Arms is incredible, and accompanied with an admirable force;
He was neuertelesse constrained to depart speedily from Civil. And he
thinking it discommodious for him, to lead Nisa with him in her woman's
Apparel, he clothed her in a suit of his, and cutting off her hair (of which
he after made great relics, he girt a sword to her side, and so they went to
Lisbone together; but they were hardly accommodated in their Lodging, when as a
Captain, and a great friend unto Lisard, Nisa her elder Brother, who is now in
Flanders) had advertisement of their coming. Although Nisa were sufficiently
disguised, yet her countenance (to those who had formerly seen her) being
sufficiently known, would easily discover that which they did so carefully
endeavor to hide.

But their good fortune (which delivered them from these dangers, it may be to
reserve them to greater) would at that time, wherein the Captain and his
friends came to search for Pamphilus, that Nisa was alone in the lodging, of
whom having inquired her name and her masters, she said, she was a Boy who
served Pamphilus of Luxan a Knight and of Madreele, not thinking that it did
import to tell his name in a strange Country. The Captain never informed
himself farther for what he sought; but his ensign, inquired news of Nisa;
whereat she being troubled, and repenting that she had said any thing of
Pamphilus, answered that she was gone by Sea with Pamphilus, to refresh
themselves as far as Belen, a famous Monastery and the ancient Sepulcher of
the Kings of Portingall. This so daine lie of Nisa saved Pamphilus his life,
or at the least the honor of both those Lovers: For the Soldiers went
presently to the Haven attending there for their return; And the Captain
accounting them already taken, and liking Nisa her fashion, behavior and
countenance, exceeding well, entreated her to become his Page, assuring her
that he would use her better, then any that ever had worn his Cassaque: Nisa
seemed to yield with great willingness, if he pleased to accept of his service,
and dissembling the care and fear, which she had of Pamphilus his life, said
unto the Captain, that having spoken with her Master, and given him an account
of such Jewels and other things as were in his custody, he would not fail to
come to him; with this answer the Captain and the Soldiers were hardly gone out
of the doors, when Pamphilus came out of the Town to his Loding, little
thinking his enemies were so near him: what help do strange Countries bring
unto those, unto whom misfortunes are ever domesticke? Nisa told him the
danger which threatened him, and Pamphilus having recourse unto the remedy,
took a speedy resolution to leave Spain. Nisa promised him to follow him
through Seas and Lands, (how unknown soever) and a Portingall Knight, who had
a Company in Cent offered to conduct him.

Cent is a frontiere Tower of the Moors in Afric, not far from Tetuan, and
as it were placed to confront Gibralter, as the uttermost bound of Europe: by
which place it is said the Moors entered, who under the leading of Julian
conquered Spain. There remained our two Lovers for some time in great peace;
although Pamphilus discontent, to see his desires denied by Nisa her chaste
resolution, had no great quietness in his own mind. He would have married
her, but it was not possible to persuade Nisa unto it; she thinking it would
be a great disparagement unto her honor, for her to be married in this
manner: And then when he seemed with reason to persuade her; she contradicted
him with tears, remonstrating that she was his, and that true love had a
respect unto an honest end, whereas he who propounded unto himself only
delight, differed little from a Beast. Pamphilus cursed these reasons of Nisa,
and sometimes out of grief, would go a whole day and not speak unto her,
until in the end overcome with her sweet patience, he was constrained to send
a thousand sighs as imbassadors for a peace unto her, who had the empire over
him.

Now the noble courage of this young Knight, seeing himself amongst so many
brave Soldiers, who went every day to the wars against the Moors, did
believe that it was a dishonor unto his birth, to carry a Sword idle by his
side, whilst others bathed theirs in their enemies blood; wherefore one
morning from the watch Towers, the Bells and Trumpets giving the allarum,
incited by his own generosity, and with the disdaines, wherewith Nisa in his
opinon had disgraced him three or four days before, he went forth armed at
all points, having a red Scarf upon his left arm, a white Feather upon his
helm, and a mountain of snow upon his Shield; from the top of which, as from
Mount Gibell in Scicily came a mouth of fire. So went Pamphilus out upon his
bay Horse, which had a black main, and a black tail, and a white star in
the forehead, filling the Portugals with admiration, to see with what address
he managed him; and how gracefully he bore his Lance; but Nisa her evil
fortune, or his own desperate resolution who prayed at his departure that she
might not see him return alive, suffered the Battle to be ordered in such
manner that day, that the Christians had the worst; and Pamphilus searching
death, brake into a Squadron of Moors, where being wounded and overthrown, he
was taken and led prisoner unto Fesse.

The news of this accident came speedily unto Nisa her ears, for the report
of evil successes come sooner to the ears of Lovers then that of happy
events: what her grief was it is not necessary to express, otherwise then in
representing Nisa, far from her Parents, out of her own Country, and from
any friends, and which was most, from the dear presence of him, for whose sake
she had quited all these, and for whose loss she was almost out of her wits.
But as the greatest incounters of fortune, do sometime, bring forth the
greatest strength and courage of the mind; so Nisa her grief raised in her
weak and womanly mind such valiant virtue, that she boldly thrust herself
into the acquaintance and friendship of a Moore, who with a safe conduct
trafficked in Cent: him she so far gained with her affability and presence,
that he lead her with him to Fesse under the habit of an Alarbe, he teaching
her in few days the greatest part of the Language (of which she was not
altogether ignorant before) Nisa thus lived in Fesse in the habit of a Moore,
and under the name of Nephew unto this Barbarian, who charmed with her
understanding, gentleness of spirit, and graceful behavior, indeauoured to
persuade her to leave our Religion, promising to give him his Daughter with the
best part of his estate, which was exceeding much. Nisa did not refuse him,
nevertheless she entreated him, that he would first suffer her to be instructed
in the Law, that she might receive it with more assurance, and more quietness
of mind. With these words; and with her beauty, Nisa grew absolute master of
this Moore, of his women, (wherein they abound) of Lela Axa his Daughter, of
his goods, his slaves, and his Horses: upon which, as she rid up and down the
Town for her pleasure, she was almost adored by these Barbarians. She called
herself Azan Rubin, amongst them, a name which Alijaffer had given her in
memory of his Son, in whose place he accounted of her, saying that she was
his Portrature. Amongst Alijaffers slaves, there was one Spaniard, with whom
Nisa having many times speech, she entreated him, that he would inquire
secretly, with whom a slave of the Kingdom of Toledo lived; and whose name was
Pamphilus? This man informed himself the same day; and following her, when
she was alone, he told her, that Saly Morato had taken him in a Battle
which was fought in Cent, and had him still in his power, with other Slaves who
served the Masons about the house, which he was building: Nisa glad of these
news, in the evening got on Horseback, Clothed in a Scarlet Casque, laid
about with gold Lace, having a Hat upon her head imbroadered with Pearl, and
a great Feather, and a rich Sword of Tunis hanging in a Scarf by her side: In
this manner she went into the street, where Saly Morat dwelt; and saw (in a
new house which was there a building) her miserable (but beloved Pamphilus,
not yet fully healed of his wounds, having a poor dublet of course Canuas, and
breeches of the same, without shoes upon his feet, and carrying with another
Christian, the materials wherewith that house was to be built; she stayed not
(as she had thought) because that seeing him in this estate, the tears which
she shed, would have discovered her; but feyning to turn her horse in the
street, and the beams of her face properly resembling them of the Sun) hau^ng
scattred the clouds of this water, she stayed, looking upon these slaves, and
said unto Pamphilus in the Language of Fesse, why does Morato build this fair
house, having another in this street so fair? Pamphilus answered (according
to his knowledge) that they were for the keeping of slaves, because that since
his good success in the former war, he was grown proud, and did presage that
he should have many. Thou art then his slave, said she, in the Castillian
tongue. Pamphilus answered, that by his misfortune he was brought to that
estate, and earnestly beholding her face, let fall to the ground that which he
held in his hand. Wondering to see a Moore which should so perfectly resemble
his beloved Nisa: for that this should be she, he could not persuade himself,
by reason of her Language, her habit, and the small time since that he left
her in Cent: so he remained without speaking, indeuouring to cover his
astonishment and confusion by his silence: When as she speaking unto him in
the Arabian tongue, asked of him if he were a Knight? Pamphilus more assured
that it was Nisa, by the resemblance of her face, and distrusting it was not
she by her language, hearing her speak the language of Fesse so naturally,
answered her. I told Saly Morato that I was a poor man, but because you
resemble so much a Master which heretofore I had (unto whom I never lied in my
life) I will not deceive you. I am a Castillian Knight, and of the Kingdom of
Toledo, and of a place, whereof it is not possible but you should have heard,
because that the names of Princes Courts are notorious to all Nations, as Paris
in France, Rome in Italy, Constantinople in Greece; and Madreele in Spain;
there was I borne, subject unto this misfortune wherein you see me. But gentle
Moore, I pray tell me, who you are, and why you ask of me my Country and my
quallitie? I am said Nisa, Nephew unto the governor Alijaffer, and son unto
Muley Nuzan his brother, by a Christian slave; who was borne in Toledo: my name
is Hazan Rubin, although that heretofore I called my self by my mothers name,
Ceuill Mendossa: my uncles son being dead, he sent for me to Moroco, the place
of my birth, from whence he brought me hither, and to comfort himself called
me by the name of his son; promising me to marry me unto Lela Axa his
Daughter, who is the fairest in all Affrique, and this is the reason which
inciteth me to love Christians (who are well borne) because my mother was one;
especially Spaniards and of her own Country: and it greeues me extremely that
thou art belonging to this governor, who is reputed to use his slaves hardly,
as it may be seen by experience in thy self, who being such, that thy
nobility does manifestly appear, notwithstanding the misery and poverty of
thy clothes, yet does put thee to such vile labor. Wherefore as well because
thou please me well, as for the reasons which I have told thee, I will bring
it to pass, if thou think good of it, that Alijaffer shall buy thee, and in
his house there shall be nothing wanting unto thee but thy liberty; as for all
other things I will use thee as my self. Pamphilus at these words cast himself
at her feet, and by force did many times kiss them, thanking her for the
favor which she did him.

So being departed, Nisa told Alijaffer the desire which she had unto a
Spaenish slave, who was evil entreated of Saly Morato; the Moor who desired to
oblige him absolutely, and to satisfy his pleasure in all things, went the
next morning to Salye Morato; to treat with him about the sale of this slave;
which being not refused unto him, they talked of the price: Salye demanded a
thousand Ducats, because (says he) he had been taken in good equipage, both
for Arms and Horse, and a red Scarf upon his left arm, a thing which (he
said) in the time of his being in Spain he had seen in Kings Portratures:
Nisa who was most interessed at the bargain, said unto him that in Spain,
clothes were common, and the pride of Soldiers equal unto the Majesty of
their Princes: In the end they agreed upon five hundred Ducats, and Nisa going
unto the chamber, where Pamphilus lay, took him along with her; he filled
with tears, and imaginations, attributing this kindness to the resemblance
which was between the Moore and Nisa, and oftentimes he resolved to believe
that it was she; For although the habit and tongue disguised her, yet the voice
and countenance discovered her. She lodged him in a place, differing and better
then that of the slaves: she caused him incontinently to be clothed, and
going to see him the first night; she brought him one of her Smocks,
entreating him to wear it under his: Pamphilus cast himself at her feet, and
Nisa turning herself away, he humbly kissed the ground which she had trodden
upon, But they had not long talked together, when as Pamphilus grew so
certain, that if she was not Nisa he was mad; that thereby he could not
sleep, he could not eat, nor do any other thing, but show her his thoughts
in the violence of sighs: Nisa fearing that in this perplexity he might loose
his wits; to assure him, and thereby to know the secret of his heart, uttered
these words one day unto him; Pamphilus the Love which I bear thee,
constrained me to procure thy good, and to solicit thy rest: I told Alijaffer
that I stood much affected unto thee, and he answered me, that if I would he
would send thee into thy Country, that thou should go upon thy word, and
that from thence thou should upon thy honor, send him that which thou owe
him. But I who loose my life in loosing thee, have entreated him to give thee
my Sister Fatima to wife, and that thereby I doubted not but I should persuade
thee to alter thy Religion and become a Moore; If thou can be contented to
do this for me, I shall know thy gentleness, and thou shall enjoy the
beautifullest Gentlewoman in all Morocco, and shall be one of the richest men
of all Afric, because that besides what my Father left her, my Uncle will
give her a great part of his estate also, and I will give thee mine, and my
wife and I will soiourne under thy government.

Pamphilus, whose intent was to make her discover herself unto him, or else to
nettle Nisa so far, as that she should declare herself; coldely answered,
that to obey her, and to requite the duty which he ought her, he would
willingly become a Moore; as well for that reason, as also that he had seen
Fatima sometimes in the Bathes; of whom he was grown so amorous, that the
little pleasure and less health which he had, proceeded from thence. Hardly had
Nisa heard Pamphilus his resolution, when in an extreme fury she said unto
him, Ah perfidious Traitor, and barbarous enemy: without God, without faith,
without love, without loyalty; Is this that which thou owe unto Heaven, to
thy Parents, to thy Country, and to the unfortunate and miserable Nisa? who to
deliver thee, has put herself into such great dangers? I knew well my most
beloved Nisa answered Pamphilus, (embracing her) that this subtilty was
necessary, for to make thee discover thine; for thou gouernest thy self in
such manner, that before thou would have otherwise plainly declared thy
self unto me, I should have lost my wits, if not my life. Let go my Arm
ungrateful wretch said Nisa; use no more these subtleties, having discovered
so much perfideous weakness; but wretch that I am, why do I complain? seeing
that he who forsakes God, does not iniure me, in forsaking me: But in the end
after many sorrowful complaints, his satisfactions had such virtue, that her
anger being overcome by her love, they remained friends, with more pleasure,
and firmnes then ever, as it always happens unto true Lovers.

This day passed away, followed with many others, during which time, they
entered into deliberations of the means, whereby they might recover their
liberty; which seemed to them impossible in respect of the love which
Alijaffer bare unto Nisa, as also in respect of the love which Fatima bare unto
Pamphilus; for she having heard that he would be a Moor and that his Uncle
would marry her unto him, favored him, to Nisas great grief who upon this
jealousy, was for the space of three months without any loving correspondency
with him: Behold an vnheardoff story! wherein is to be seen what a woman (who
loves) can effect; seeing she deceived the distrust of an old Moore, and
brought all his house to that point that all things were governed by the only
will of Pamphilus: who taking better council, whilst Alijaffer was gone unto
Tarndan where the King lay at that time; wrought so hansomely, with Axa and
Fatima, that they would go into Spain with him, upon the remonstrance, which
he made unto them, that his love was certain and assured, and theirs
deceitful, false and not to be believed: they were not hard to be persuaded,
because they were women, Moors, and Lovers; three things of weak resistance.

So one fair night, having packed up all the best Jewels they could find,
they got all four to Horseback, and Pamphilus being clad in the like
apparel unto Nisa, that thereby they might pass more surely, they came unto
Cent, where being joyfully received by the General, he accommodated them with
Shipping for Lisbon. There he let Axa and Fatima understand, that it was
necessary for them to go to Rome, that the chief and holy Bishop might
receive them into the Church, and pardon them himself: all which they did the
sooner to get out of Spain; they being contented to follow them whether soever
they would go, imbarqued themselves all together in a Ship of Aragon, which
had brought in Wheat, and having a fair wind they arrived in Sicilie, from
whence because it was the year of Iubile, they went all four in the habit of
Pilgrims to Rome. There Axa and Fatima were Baptized, Axa was called Clement of
his Holiness his name, and Fatima was called Hipolita, from her Godmother. The
Marriage was resting still, to be performed according to promise. But Pamphilus
and Nisa entertained them always with hope, remonstrating unto them, that it
was not fit nor just, that they should be married, before they came unto their
Fathers house. So after they had seen great part of Italy and France, and from
thence they passed into Spain, where they thought that Nisa her Parents
choler was by this time over, for when thefts in Love are not chasticed upon
the act in warm blood, they are always remitted with time. But having ru^ne a
dangerous Fortune in a miserable Tartane, into which they had embarked
themselves at A Town of Sauoy.
Villa Franca, and having been long beaten with a sore tempest, they finished
their shipwreck within the sight of the walls of Barcelon, neither is known,
whether Nisa and the Moors are alive or dead: But Pamphilus swimming, attained
unto a plancke of the Ship, and within a day after, being taken up by some
Moors of Byserta, they carried him to Censtantinople where I saw him a
Captive, and where he told me what I have related.

This Nisa added unto the truth, to hide herself from Finia, knowing already
by that which was related in the first Book, how she and Pamphilus were both
taken up half Drowned, one by the Fishers, and the other by Captain Doricles,
with their several successes in their Perigrinations in Spain, until they
met together amongst the Madmen in the Hospital of Valence. Finia thanked her
much for the news which she had told her of her Brother, showing some grief
for the Death of Nisa; afterward having concluded their return into Spain,
they retired themselves together to Marselles, where they rested for some
days, Finia believing always that Nisa was this Felix, whose name she had
borrowed.

In the mean time, miserable Pamphilus suffered in Prison, with more rigorous
pain then he did before, because that his fury increasing with his grief, he
was kept so much the more straightly, by how much he was thought to be the
more mad. In the eud Iacinth came unto Valence, and being advertised by
Pamphilus, of his misfortune, he drew him out of the Cage, and had him to his
house, saying that his Parents had sent him Five hundred Crowns of Castreele,
to defray the charge of his Cure at his house; All those who remained in the
Hospital, were sorry, because until that time, there was never seen a
Madman so wise, nor a wise man which did imagine so many follyes. There did
Pamphilus take again his ancient habit, and being departed from Iacinth and
his Sister, (in whom the wonderfulnes of his story, raised no less Love then
pity:) took again the second time his way to Barcelon, where he was no
sooner come, but he was met and known, by one of those whom he had wounded in
Mountserrat: he was then the second time laid in Prison, in the same place
where two Almains his companions had remained until that time. A thing worthy
of admiration in any understanding, that a man should not be able to find the
clew whereby he might get out of so many Labyrinths; from Barcelon to Valence,
and from Valence to Barcelon, in iourneying in a small part of his Country,
with more variable successes then Eneas did in his voyage of Italy, or Ulysses
in that of Greece. Pamphilus saw there his friends with great grief, and was
received by them with great joy. And Finia and Nisa coming from Marselles by
little and little over the craggy Mountains, which divide France from Spain,
came unto Perpignan, where I leave them to their rest, attending the fourth
Book.

The end of the Third Book.
The Fourth Book.
GReat is Love amongst the GODS, and amongst Men marvelous (says Phedrius in
Plato: Hesiodus says, that the two first things which were seen after the
Chaos, was Love, and the Earth. Parmenides says that he was engendered before
the Gods; preferring him in knowledge unto the Father of the Muses: And in
War, before the god of Battayles; making this argument, that, that which
detayneth is greater then that which is detayned; and that he is truly strong,
who vanquisheth the strong: He calls it the light of the understanding, and
assures that, that only lives in darkness which is not lightened with his
fire. And among other attributes, he calls it the God of Peace, the Father of
desire, and the appetite of good; in the presence of which the soul desires
to be eternally: From whence it follows, that Love is a desire of
immortality, which reconcileth affections, gives good will, takes away
hatred: Of the nature of this Love, was that of our Pilgrims, at the least
Nisa'es, who being with Finta, departed from Perpignan, came with her into
Barcelon, about that time, when the Sun having passed the middle of the day,
descends toward the West Indyes. But Fortune not yet weary with troubling
and crossing them, showed her, that the first were only to be feared, in
regard of those which were necessarily to follow: For as she entered with
Finia into the City, a confused throng of people constrained them to stand in
the middle of the street. Nisa desirous to know upon what occation such a
world of people was assembled; and seeing an Old man, who related it unto
others, with pity, she entreated him (out of courtesy) to tell her: It is
(Pilgrims my friends) said the old man, because there is a Knight a Castillian
going to have his head cut off, for killing an officer of Justice, who would
have apprehended him upon suspicion of Theft, which he had not done, near unto
Mountserrat, whether he was going in Pilgrimage (as you peradventure may do:)
But besides the greatness of his Crime, which is no less then rebellion, he was
found to have in the hollow of his Staff, a Sword longer then is permitted
to be worn, by the Ordinances of this Kingdom:

I am much grieved at it answered Nisa, for many reasons; and principally,
because he is a Castillian; for as you may perceive by my Tongue, this Pilgrim
and I are both Castillians: It would more grieve you (said the old man) if you
saw his Face and his proportion, accompanied with such youth, that he does not
seem to be two and twenty years complete: Can you tell this Knights name said
Finia? one of my Sons said the old man, has been his Procter, and he told
me he was called Pamphilus of Luxan, borne at Madreele which is a City
sufficiently known throughout all the world: With a pale and deadly countenance
did the two Pilgrims behold one the other, and bursting into tears, as from
two Fountains, they embraced and fell down together. The good old man
wondering to see them thus suddenly oppressed, knew that this Knights name had
pierced to their soul; And encouraging them as much as possibly he could, he
retired them unto the door of the next house, the better to avoid the throng of
people, which stayed at the rarenes of the accident; Nisa and Finia, having
some time bewailed the miserable Pamphilus, and said unto the old man that he
was their kins-man: They might see a man enter into the street, breaking
through the prease of the people with his Horse: which moved Nisa to entreat
the old man, to enquire what he was, and upon what occasion he made such
have through the company? who being informed, and coming again, demanded a
reward for the good news which he brought. Has Pamphilus his Pardon said
Finia? He whom you saw pass by answered the old man, is a Knight of
Valence, called Iacinth of Centilla's, who coming the other day into this
Town upon some occasion, knew Pamphilus, and withal understanding he was
condemned to dye; told the Viceroy that this criminal person was a madman,
and but newly gotten out of the Hospital of Valence, as he offered to verify:
whereupon the Viceroy and the Judge, willing to save this young man, suspended
the Execution of his Judgment, and gave Commission to this Knight to bring
proof of his affection; so much the rather believing his words, by how much
Pamphilus confessed his Crime and desired to dye, with an extreme grief: But
the time expiring (which was given unto Iacinth) for the verifying of Pamphilus
madness: he was had toward the place of his Execution, and by the way, is met
by Iacinth (as you have seen) who has brought with him s^fficient proof, and
an express Command from the Viceroy, that he shall be had back again to
Valence.

These news revived Nisa and Finia, who having rested themselves there all
that day, went the next day to see him in the Prison; at the entrance whereof
they found, that for a Madman he was taken out and set upon a Mule, to be
carried to Valence. And even upon the instant, that Pamphilus lifting up his
eyes beheld his dear Nisa, and that she advanced herself to speak to him,
came one of the servants and apprehended Nisa, and his companions ceazing upon
Finia, put them both in Prison: although Pamphilus cried out that she was his
Brother, for being accounted for a Madman, he was not hearkened unto, but
contrariwise because he passionately cast himself from his Mule upon the
ground; he was with much cruelty tied upon his Mules back, and with shrewde
blows set forward in his way; their opinion of his madness being the more
confirmed.

I cannot forbear wondering every time I think of this man's misfortunes! he
came first to Barcelon to suffer at Valence all those miseries which you have
formerly heard. And now it seems, he returns that way again a new to
begin the same pains. The cause of Finia's and Nisa's apprehension, was that
Nisa in regard of his apparel and of his short hair was thought to be a man,
and being always in Finia's company, the Justice took hold of them, out of a
strong suspicion that they did live lewdly and incontinently together, a thing
which is often covered under the cloak of Pilgrimage, which makes it more
odious, and frequent in that Country. Whatsoever might happen of it, Nisa
would not discover herself notwithstanding any fear of chastisement: But
defending her cause as a man, denied that ever she had so much as spoken
otherwise then with great honesty and modesty to Finia. Who accounting Nisa
for a man, and believing certainly that she was the same Felix, whom she
fained to be, with whose conversation and beauty she was charmed, confessed
simply her desire, (for the effect was impossible) and although the honesty of
their conversation did appear by both their Confessions, yet their beauty was
a cruel witness against their innocence.

About this time came the afflicted (Celio by the mountains of France, the
principal Cittyes whereof he had sought for his beloved Finia) back to
Barcelon, still continuing his quest, and only to inform himself if there
were any Pilgrims of Casteele; and having understood that there were two
Prisoners but a few days before, he went to see them, hoping to hear some
news, if not of Finia, at least of the Country. His fortune would that he
should first meet with her before he saw his Sister Nisa, and being
advertised, that she had been taken with a young man, and laid up for the
suspicion that was had of their dishonest Love, He spoke unto her through an
Iron-grate, which seperateth the men's Prisons from the women's.

Is this O Finia, the confidence which I had of thy virtue so consormable to
the noblenes of thy blood? Is it here, (after having searched thee almost all
France over, having measured step by step all the teadious plains, and craggy
mountains, which did lead unto any place, where there was either hope or
likelihood to find thee, undergoing many notable dangers) that I should think
to find thee in a public Prison with a young man? Now are all my suspicions
confirmed, and my reasons that I had to kill the Frenchman, for which I have
suffered so many travails: Is this the recompense of so many evils, which for
thy sake I have endured? Do thou thus requite thy obligations unto me? At
the least this comfort I have, I may return into my Country, with full
assurance that I shall not incur any infamy, neither in thy friends opinion
nor in mine own: for having left thee in this danger, and in those which will
vneuitably follow thee, seeing thou have found another, who accompanies thee,
honoreth thee, and defends thee. Think not, O ungrateful person, answered
Finia in weeping, that I have ever offended thee, for thou can not make me
suffer so much, that I would hazard that which thou have cost me, for all the
treasure of the world: Thy Jealousy made thee kill a man and leave me alone,
in such a place; the difficulty of getting away from whence, considering my
weakness, may seem a miracle. In my voyage I have met with this man, who no
less innocent then chaste Joseph, suffers this unjust imprisonment, for
having bin the most honest helper that I could have desired in thy absence, as
thou may plainly see by the modesty of his countenance and his speech, if
thou please to speak with him. To excuse thy self answered Celio, in so
notorious a crime, is to move me to greater anger, because thou may have
failed as a Woman, but to deny it unto me, and to say that thou have not done
it, is a most evident token that thou will deceive me, either here or in thy
own Country, (if ever thou return thither) therefore I do forbid thee for
ever to dare to name me, or to say thou ever knew me. So said Celio, and
turning his back to Finia, left her in the greatest grief that a woman could
suffer; which is in these accidents to loose his presence, under whose
protection she lives: especially when it seems unto her, that she cannot
hope for any other remedy or succor. Celio hiding the tears which he shed in
going away, and consulting with the fury of his Jealousy, and his rage for the
injury which he did think he had received, concerning the revenge which he
should take; waited for Nisa's enlargement, that he might kill him. The Judges
although that the Prisoners innocence did sufficiently appear, yet would they
not give them liberty to return together. (For those do seem to permit the
evil, which do not forbid the occasion) but retired Finia into a house, and
commanded Nisa whom they called Felix, that, that day he should void the
City of Barcelon. Nisa went then late in the evening out of the Town, and
far from thinking that her Brother waited to kill her, believing her to be
the man, with whom Finca had so irreconciliably offended him: And the darkness
of the evening with the disguise of man's Apparel which Nisa wore, deprived
Celio's eyes, (already blinded with anger) from discerning her to be his Sister
Nisa, into whose body he twice thrust his Sword, and had absolutely killed
her, if some passengers upon the way at that time, had not, not only hindered
him, but also apprehended him and put him in Prison.

The miserable Nisa, who then began to have a greater feeling of her sufferred
miseries, was carried to an honorable Citizens house of great compassion and
charity, who having given order for her Dressing, and found that her wounds
were not mortal, pursued Celio so eagerly in Justice, informing the Judges of
the crime which he himself had seen him commit, that the third day after he
was condemned to Death. Celio alleged in his defense, that Finia was his
lawful wife, and that having found her imprisoned with this young man for
suspicion of incontinency, he did not think that he had done evil, if he
had killed them both. Whereupon they ordered it, that Finia should be
imprisoned again; but she having some notice thereof, prevented it by flight.

On the other side, Pamphilus coming to Valence, recovered his liberty by
Iacinths means; with an extreme contentment unto Tiberia, unto whom
Pamphilus giving thanks, for the care which she had of him, raised in her a
thousand hopes which his absence, and misery had killed. He takes leave of
her with many fair and amorous words, and returning to Barcelon, went to
seek for his Dear Nisa in the Prison, wherein he had seen her shut, when he
went away as a Madman.

But when he found Celio there in her place, in such extreme danger of his
life, from whom (informing him of the cause of his misfortune) he was told
all the injury, which Finia had don him with a Pilgrim, whom he had wounded,
whereby he came to know that this man, whom Celio out of Jealousy would have
killed, was his own Sister Nisa. And with the grief of so unhappy a news,
Pamphilus cried out; O cruel Celio, thou have taken away the life of thy own
Sister, and my dear Wife, whom under this habit accompanied my Fortunes: and
it may be also my sister Finia, for whose sake thou have unjustly killed Nisa.
I am Pamphilus thy enemy, unto whom (not knowing of me) thou did recite the
story of thy Fortunes, who have already pardoned the injury which thou have
done unto my honor in rauishing away Finia, having consideration of the injury
which I did thee in leading away Nisa.

With less grief would Celio have heard the sentence of his Death, then the
relation which Pamphilus made; for he remained so astonished and silent, as if
he had been taken out of Prison to go to execution. He would have justified
his innocence, but being not able to utter one word, he remained dumb, and
his hands and his feet without any motion, made him appear as one insensible.
Pamphilus as almost mad, left him in the Prison, and going up and down to
enquire for Nisa, he was accounted for a Madman by all those who saw him,
for they did remember that for a Madman he was saved, being condemned to dye.

Pamphilus having been three or four times at Iacinths house; Love, to work
the greater confusion, had augmented his Sister Tiberia's desires; who (as you
have heard) cast her eyes upon Pamphilus his beauty: he overcome with the
good turns, and pitiful care which she had of his misfortunes, had not
rigorously entreated her thoughts: She, when this last time she saw him return
to Barcelon, and that neither her prayers nor entreaties could stay him; writ
unto her Brother (who did accompany him in his Journey) how that Pamphilus, out
of the lustful courage of an ungrateful guest, had so far forgotten
himself, as to move Love unto her, and that she, yielding unto his
persuasions, had imbarqued herself, with more sure gages, then, without the
bonds of Marriage, did fit either with her honor, or the reputation of either
of them.

Iacinth angry at this evil correspondency, and ungrateful acknowledgement of
his Friendship, good turns, and hospitallity, sought Pamphilus, as earnestly
as he sought Nisa, and having found him; led him out of the Town upon the
shore side, where he showed him his Sisters Letter: Afterward (setting his
hand upon his Sword) he said, he would wish him to draw his Sword: now to
offend him, that Sword which formerly he had at Valence, drawn in his defense
(although a treacherous fellow, as he was, did not deserve to have his Sword
measured with his. The innocent Pilgrim excused himself, entreating him to
let him search out Nisa, whom (he said) he had heard was sore wounded, and that
he would not upon the Lies and indiscretio^ of a despised woman, hinder him in
this business which did so nearly concern him, as did the searching for his
dear wife, who was in danger of losing her life; and that he himself was the
most assured witness, how much pain, labor and danger Nisa had cost him; the
only thoughts of whom, had kept him from taking pleasure in any other thing:
These excuses did not satisfy Iacinth, because the opinion which he had
conceived of his Sister Tiberia's virtues, did darken in his understanding, the
light of all Pamphilus his reasons: who out of the many Obligations, against
his honor and condition, suffered Iacinths injurious words. But in the end,
seeing him threaten him, with his Sword in his hand, calling him base Coward,
Runnagate, and many other insupportable Insolences; he drew his Sword to
stay his Enemies, and with a point nimbly running upon him, ouerthrewe him to
the ground, if not dead, yet at least so near dead, that he seemed so.
Pamphilus most grievously detesting his most outrageous fortune, took him up in
his arms and carried him into the town, the one shedding his blood, and the
other his tears; and finding strong life in him, he persuaded him of the truth
of his innocence, leaving him at a Church door (whether the people flocked
apace to see him, knowing that he was wounded.) And without inquiring any
further of Nisa, he went once again out of Barcelon, although much more sad;
for he left his best friend whom he had sorely wounded with his own hand, and
his dearest Friend near the hands of death.

Iber so called of Iberia, an ancient City of that Kingdom (sometimes very
rich) not far from that place where Scipio vanquished the Cartheginians, and
as Titus Liuius affirms, joined Spain unto the Roman Empire, running from
two Fountains, batheth the fields of the Cantabrians and the Celtiberians (it
taking his name from the Celtes which came out of France, and from the Province
of Iberia, no less rich and fruitful then those which of the same name are
called Iberian, near the Mountain Caucasas, having abundance of Gold within
their Veins. This famous flood according unto Pliny, rises near unto the
ancient Iuliobrica, and after many windings and turnings comes to wash the
walls of Sallibinum, which Caesar called Caesar Augustus, and the injury of
times Saragossa.

At the course of these Christaline waters, Pamphilus stayed his flight,
sitting down upon the bancke of the River, which began to swell with his
tears, so pitiful to behold, that the very winds did seem to condole with
him in his complaints by their doleful noise, amongst the leaves of the Trees,
and the Birds warbling out their woes. There was not any thing of life, which
had not some show of sorrow with him, unless it were the Fishes, which being
dumb, did not put forth their heads out of their clear waters at the
importunity of other voices, yet their silence did seem to join with him in
sorrow. Is it possible said he, that the fear of loosing this unprofitable
Life, should have more power over me, then the duties which I owe, unto my
birth and unto my Mistres? How comes it to pass, that not to loose a thing, so
vile in my eyes, so heavy to my soul, and so grievous to my suffering, I have
lost the most esteemed of my understanding, the most honored of my memory and
the most adored of my will? It is thou fair Nisa, who over the sharp
Mountains of Toledo, did courageously follow my steps, from their highest
tops even unto the sands of the Spanish Sea: thou art she, who in the
Battle of Cent did bitterly bewail my Captivity: art not thou O my Dear
Nisa she, who under the habit of a Moore and under the name of Hazan Ruben,
drewest me from the Kingdom of Fesse, and from the Captivity of Sali Morata?
Were not thou cast away with me at Sea, in our return from Italy within the
view of Barcelon walls, and whom the Sea cast up on the shore, as unworthy to
possess so rich a Pearl? Did not thou live afterward a long time amongst
the Madmen as deprived of thy reason, with the very grief of my Death? did
not thou suffer new Shipwreck at Marselles? And finally wounded by thy jealous
Brother lie now in a strange Country either sick or dead? Seeing all this
is so, how can I apprehend the least motion of leaving thee? Where is my
courage or am I not Pamphilus of Luxan? Is this the virtuous blood of those
valiant Governors, who so nobly defended the walls of Madreele, from the
Moors of Toledo? It is not possible! I am not my self, my misfortunes have
changed me into something else. To be in Love and to be a Coward is a manifest
contrariety: yet to deny that I Love, is to say the Sun is darkness, and the
night Lightness, especially since I cannot say, but that I have seen Nisa. But
seeing I do confess that I have seen her, how can I say but that I love her?
And if I love her, how can I leave her? And if I have left her, wherefore do I
live?

So did Pamphilus accuse himself for having left Nisa for any danger; no more
nor no less, then as one who travailing upon the way remembers something of
importance which he had forgotten at home, breaking off from his discourse and
from his company, turns back again to his lodging, where he thinks he
shall never come time enough; with the same have Pamphilus takes his way back
again to Barcelon, from which both in have and fear he had departed. A strong
chain of Lovers, which tied to their desired beauty, shortens it self by the
force which lengthens it, until it return unto its centure. Beauty without
doubt, which lifting up the vapors of the Lovers eyes, seems to draw unto
its self the very weighty and earthy part, in despite of all resistance made
by the natural weight, and as the Sun oftentimes conuerteth into burning
beams, the humor which is concealed in the Clouds; so Beauty conuerteth into
fire all the tears and sadnesses of Lovers.

Few Leagues had Pamphilus iourneyed from the famous Collony of the Romans,
when as going down a Hill, it being so late, as that the Sun had left no
light in the West, but as it were a golden girdle; which inuironing the
Horizon, did seem as a Crown unto the neighboring night: he heard a voice
grievously complaining in a Meadow, which shadowed with high Rocks, was very
dark.

The courageous Pilgrim went into it, and saw a man lying upon the Grass,
amongst the Trees which were watered with a fresh Brook, of whom demanding
the cause of his complaint; he entreated him to come unto him, if he desired
to know, before he yielded up his soul, caused by three mortal wounds which
were made in his body. Pamphilus approached unto him although with some
distrust, and lifting him up leaned his head against a Tree. I am a Knight said
the wounded man; treacherously murdered by his hands* who has received most
good turns from me. There is a Monastery in these fields which is not far
from hence, if thou can carry me upon thy shoulders thither, thou shall be
the Encas of my soul, and I the Anchises, saved peradventure from the eternal
Fire which I have merited. Pamphilus laid down his Palmers staff (oh how
hurtful it is to leave ones weapons upon any occasion whatsoever) taking him
in his arms; And remembering that he had so carried Iacinth; he thought with
himself, that seeing he was come to carry others unto the Grave, he was not
far from thence himself: and comforted himself with this, that if he were
not Death himself, he was yet his Beer. So iourneying toward the Monastery,
with the wounded man, who with broken speeches interrupted, by his approaching
Death, recited the cause thereof. The Pilgrim being come unto the Gate, and
seeing by the clear light of the Moon, in the front thereof, the Image of our
Blessed Lady the Virgin; said unto the wounded man, that he should recommend
his soul whilst he knocked at the gate. At whose knocking the Porter being
come, and informed by the Pilgrim of the accident, answered; tht with like
dissimulation, certain Bandoleers of Iara, had one night robbed the Monastery,
and for that cause he could not open the gate, without the superiors License.
Pamphilus entreated him to dispatch: but there being a long Garden between the
Monastery and Cell, before he could return the Knight dyed in his arms.

Pamphilus looked pale, dismayde with the accident, and almost as dead as he,
and encouraging him to this fearful and sharp passage, laid a Cross of two
Myrtle bows upon his stomach. Instantly he heard a troop of Horse, whose
masters being divided into diverse paths, did seek for the Dead man; By their
words and their diligence, the Pilgrim knew their design, and calling them,
showed them him whom they sought for, telling them how he had found him.
Amongst them was his Brother, who seeing Pamphilus bloody, and in a Pilgrims
habit (which is enough to make an honest man suspected) cried out, Oh thou
Castillian traitor, thouhast murdered him to rob him. And at the very instant,
the same friend who had killed this poor Knight, and who the better to cover
his treason, accompanying the Brother, took hold of the Pilgrims arm; thou
robber and infamous assassiuator, what has made thee murder the noblest
Knight which was in this Country? Sirs replied Pamphilus, I found him in a
Meadow hard by, bewayling his death, which he said was wrought by the hand of
one whom he did account his best friend: and out of compassion and at his
entreaty, I brought him to this Monastery, where he departed this life in my
arms. But Tansiles (who was this Traitor which had killed him) fearing least
the Pilgrim might discover something, which he might have heard from the dying
man concerning his treason, pulling out a Pistol from the pommell of his
saddle, gave fire and aimed it directly at his head. Yet Heaven not permitting
that it should go off (for Saints and Angels do always assist the innocent)
the Pilgrim lived. O let him live said Tirsus, (so was the dead man's brother
called) for it is much better, that keeping him in Prison, he may confess his
own crime: and whether he killed him for to rob him, or whether some enemy of
my Brother Godfreyes did not hyer him to murder him. The traitor answered to
Tirsus, and to the others who did accompany him, that blood (yet warm) of his
friend would not suffer him to delay his revenge so long. Yet all their
opinions prevailing against his; the innocent Pamphilus was bound hand and foot
upon a Horse, and dead Godfrey laid upon another. It is a just Judgment said
Pamphilus, (by the way) for my leaving of Nisa wounded, and Iacinth almost
dead. Do you not hear said Tirsus? without doubt this Nisa is the woman for
whose sake he has committed this murder, and Iacinih some friend, who led my
Brother to the place. All of them believed what Tirsus said, and the traitor
Tansiles iuterpreted Pamphilus his dispaires in such sort, that every one
believed that Pamphilus did speak of Godfreys death.

They led him into no Town, as he thought they would, but unto a Grange
house, about half a League from the Monastery, the gate whereof was between
two Towers. Tirsus knocks, and a servant answering: tell my Mother and
Sisters (said he) that I have brought my brother Godfrey dead, and his
murderer with him. Instantly he heard a great cry in the Hall of the house,
by which Pamphilus did know that Fortune prepared a great deal of evil for
him: Nevertheless desiring to Dye, he resolved not to defend his life with his
tongue, which he could not do with his arms. One opens the door of the
house, and with Candles lighted, the miserable Mother, with her Daughters and
servants received her dead Son. Some howling and crying carried him into the
Hall, others ran upon poor Pamphilus, tearing his Beard and pulling him by
the hair of the Head, and almost astonished him with blows. With this good
entertainment, he was lodged this night in one of the Towers, having his body
laden with Irons, yet he was heard utter no words, but only that he deserved
this and more for forsaking Nisa. All this night nothing was heard but cries
and complaints for Godfrey, and the time which was not employed in this
Funeral exercise, they spent in talking of Nisa and what she should be, whom
their Prisoner had so often in his mouth.

The light of the morning which very slowely enters into Prisons, brought day
unto Pamphilus, not in waking him who had not slept, but in aduertising his
soul of his approaching Death, the certain news whereof he would willingly
have welcomed with gifts: when as the Prison door being open, he saw
Godfreys Mother and Sisters enter, demanding of him in great passion and
choler, wherefore he had killed her Son? but he answering, only for Nisa's
sake am I reduced unto this misery, they began to beat him with such rage,
that they left him almost dead; and shutting the Prison, they resolved to
famish him to Death. But whilst about noone, the dead body was carried to
Burial, with Lights, Mourning, and Funeral company of his Parents and
friends: Flerida his youngest Sister, mollified with Pamphilus complaints, were
it that his countenance did enforce her to believe his innocence, or that some
other secret simpathy inclined her to have pity of his life: went unto the
Prison, and by the hole of the lock, said thus unto him: unfortunate Pilgrim,
do not afflict thy self, for I will free thee in despite of my mother and my
brothers; who art thou said Pamphilus who promisest life when there is nothing
but heaven which can give it me? I am Flerida (answered she) one of Godfreys
Sisters who do promise it unto thee, afflicted with thy grief, out of the
assurance I have in my own imagination of thy innocence.

I swear unto thee by God said Pamphilus, that going in the night through a
Meadowe, I found thy brother wounded unto death, as he told me by one whom he
did reccon to be his best friend; I took him upon my shoulders, and carried him
unto the Monastery, where he dyed in my arms before the Gate was opened: I do
not desire to live, but the care which I have of another life more then mine
own, makes me seek my liberty contrary to my desire; If thou can procure
me it, I am a Knight, and of a family, from which ungrateful man nor Traitor
ever sprang: thou shall do a heroique deed worthy of an illustrious Lady, and
though I should never merit it, yet heaven will not fail to acknowledge it.
Flerida had not need of so many reasons, who was virtuous, and so well disposed
to free him, that she would hazard a thousand lives to give it unto him. And
(as aptly it served) those which were gone to accompany her brothers body to
the Grave, not being able to return speedily (as well in regard of the
distance of the place, as in respect of the pomp of the Funeral, which lasted
nine days) gave her oportune means to open the plankes on the top of the
Prison, thereby letting him down some vittailes: All her other Sisters, her
Mother, and the servants only entered to torment him, they seeing him live, not
knowing wherewith he did sustain himself; anger, indignation, and cruelty,
increased so far in them, that they resolved to kill him, before Tirsus his
return from the Obsequies of his brother: But Flerida the same night gave him
such strong Fyles, that the Fetters, Staples and Locks, being cut asunder, and
he being fastened unto a cord, she drew him up by that hole which she had
made, by removing the planke; and all the household being in their dead sleep,
she opened the Gates: afterward, with honest imbracings, shedding some tears,
and with many Iuels which she did constrain him to take, she was departing
from him, when he casting himself at her feet, with the humblest words he
could speak, promising to repay her this good turn with an immortal
remembrance; and if that ever she had occation to come into Casteele, she
should enquire for a Knight of Madreele called Pamphilus of Luxan, that she
might be assured she should not return without due thanks and
acknowledgements for so perfect an Obligation.

Pamphilus knowing that to proceed further in the quest of Nisa, was to resist
the will of heaven, which had opposed him in it with so many rigorous
successes, went unto Saragossa; resolving from thence to travel into Casteele.
If thou did not possess O Nisa (said he unto himself as he went along) all
my thought, and if thou did not hold as much place in my body, as my soul
does, which is all in every part; who would doubt, but Flerida should be now
Mistress of my will? O how powerful are good turns in apt occasions* seeing
that the firmenes of Love, which could not be moved with such paynefull
trauells, such fearful shipwracks, and with such cruel Captiuities and
imprisonments, with one good turn alone in an opportune time, is shaken, if
not mastered; at least the roof, if not the walls; and although the
foundation be firm, yet the windows and other ornaments do shake: Let not
those which shall hear this be displeased with him; for this was not so much a
change from the Love of Nisa, as a feeling of Flerida's goodwill: and as there
is no body so solid, which the Sun sometime does not pierce; so there is no
Love so firm, but that the first motions thereof may shake.

Pamphilus so by long travail came unto Saragossa, and would not enter into it
before it was dark night, for fear he might be followed or met by some one
whom he knew: and very early in the morning departed from thence, and by
vn-vsed paths, from pasture to pasture, and from mountain to mountain, he
endeavored to shun the great high way, fearing that Flerida's Brother might
make pursuit after him. In the end wearyed with the sharpnes of the
Mountains, and the austerity of the life, which he was constrained to lead,
he resolved one night to lie in some place where he might be better
accommodated then in these Deserts, and entering into a City which divides the
two Kingdoms, he enquired for a Lodging, But no body being willing to
entertain him, seeing him so euilly apparelled, his feet bloody, his face
tanned, his hair knotted and shagged: he went unto the Hospital, the last
refuge of misery. Pamphilus found the gates open at that time, but without
light, and asking the cause, he was told, that in regard of a strange noise
which every night was there heard, which has happened ever since the Death of
a stranger who came thither to Lodge, no body has dwelt there; yet he might
(as they said) enter in if he would, for he should find there a man of holy
life in a little Chapel, who endured for the honor of God all those
illusions, and who would show him a place where he might lie without danger.
Pamphilus then entered into a dark obscure place, and after some few steps he
might see a great way off, a dim light of a Lamp, unto which place he
addressed himself, and called the holy man: What would thou have thou wicked
Spirit, answered the holy man? Thou do mistake me said Pamphilus, I am a
Pilgrim, who do endeavor to seek a lodging for this night. Then he opened
the door, where Pamphilus saw a man of a middle stature and age, with a long
Beard and hair, a Gown of course rugge down unto his anckles, the Chapel
was little, and Altar venerable, the basse whereof did serve him for his Bed:
he had a Stone for his pillowe, his Staff for his companion, and a Deaths
head for his looking-glass.

How durst thou come into this place, said he unto the Pilgrim, did no man
advertise thee of the disquiet Lodging which is here? I have been told it
answered the Pilgrim, but I have suffered so much Labor in my travails, so
much Cruelty in imprisonments, so many heavy misfortunes and cold
entertainments, that no disquiet can be new unto me.

The poor man then lighted a Candle at the Lamp, which burned before the
Altar, and without saying any thing commanded the Pilgrim to follow him; he
went through a Garden, which lay wild as a Forest or wilderness, where having
showed him a part of the house, amongst some Cypres Trees he unlocked the
door of a Chamber, and said unto him, seeing thou art young and accustomed to
travails, enter here: make the sign of the Cross and be not dismayde nor
astonished but sleep; Pamphilus takes the Candle, and setting it upon a stone
which lay there, bids his Host good night and shutteh the door.

There was a Bed in the Chamber good enough to rest upon, especially for a man
who has layne so many nights upon the ground: this invited him to unclothe
himself, and taking one of the shirts which Flerida at his departure had given
him, he put it on, and went into it. Hardly had he reuolued in his imagination,
the confusion of his life, a thing which often (the body being at rest) is
represented unto the mind, when as sleep which is truly called the Image and
brother of Death, possessed his senses with that force, which does accustomably
use unto weary Pilgrims. All that part, which the Sun abandoneth when it
goes down unto the Indyes was in a deepesilence, when as the noise of some
Horses awaked Pamphilus, he thought he was stirring (as it many times happens
unto Trauailers) and that his bed did move as a Ship or a Horse, which did
carry him. Nevertheless remembering that he was in the Hospital, and the causes
for which it was uninhabitable; he opened his eyes, he saw Horsemen enter by two
and two into the Chamber, who lighting Torches which they had in their hands
at the Candle which he had left burning by him, they cast them against the
seeling of the Chamber, where they stuck fast with their bottomes upward and
their tops downwards, which dropped down burning flames upon his bed, and upon
his clothes: He covers himself as well as possibly he could, leaving a little
hole to look out that he might see whether his bed did burn or no; when as
instantly he saw the flames out, and that upon a Table which was in the corner
of the Chamber, four of them were at Primero, they passed, discarded, and set
up money as if they had truly playde: so long till at length they debating
upon a difference, they fell into quarrel in the Chamber, which made such a
noise with clashing of Swords, that the miserable Pamphilus called upon (for
help) our Lady of Gadalupe, which was only left (of all the shrynes in
Spain) unvisited, although it were in his own Country of Toledo. Because holy
places near unto one, are many times left unvisited out of a hope, which is
had, that they might be visited at any time. Nevertheless the clattering of the
swords and all other noise, for the space of half an hour ceased, and he was
all of a sweat out of the very fear he had; yet now well satisfied to see
himself in their absence at some rest, not thinking that they would come
again, when instantly he felt that the bed and the clothes were pulled away
from him by the outtermost corners: and he saw at the same time, a man come in
with a Torch in his hand lighted, followed by two others, the one with a great
brazen Basin, and the other sharpening a little Knife. Then began he to
tremble, and all his hair stood an end, he would have spoken but he was not
able, when they were near him, he who held the Torch put it out, and Pamphilus
thinking that they would kill him, and that the Basin was to receive his blood,
put his hands forth against the knife, and felt that they laid hold on him;
he gave a great cry, and the Torch instantly kindled again: and he saw
himself between two Mastiffe dogs, who held him fast in their teeth. Jesus
cried out Pamphilus, at which name all these fanstasticke illusions vanished
away, leaving him so weary and so affrighted with their company, that he would
not stay there any longer: but going out into the Garden by which he was
entered, he went unto the Chamber of the good Hermit, who seeing him so pale,
weak and naked, opened him the door, and said unto him; have your Hosts here
given you an evil nights Lodging? So ill said Pamphilus, that I have not
rested all night, and yet I have left them my clothes to pay for it. The good
man received him as well as he could; telling him how many others with like
success had been so used, and many other discourses, wherewith he past away
the night until morning.

Those who do not know the nature, quality, and condition of Spirits, will
account of this history as a fable: wherefore I do not think it unfit to
advertise them, that there are some, fallen from the lowest Quire of Angels,
who out of the Essential pains, which is the Eternal privation from the
sight of God, suffer less pains then the other, as not having so much sinned.
And those are of such Nature that they cannot much hurt men, but do take
pleasure to displease them; with frightings, noyses, rumors, subtilties, and
such like other things, which they do in the night in houses, which thereby
they make altogether uninhabitable, not being able otherwise to hurt but by
these foolish and ridiculous effects, limited and bound, by the Almighty power
of God. These the Italians call Fayries, the Spaniards Elues, and the French
Hobgoblins; of whose mockery and sports William Totan speaks, in his Book of
War of Devils, calling them Devils of the less noble Hierarchy. Cassian
writes, that in Norway they possess high ways, play with passengers, and do
hyer themselves out for wages as servants. Jerome Manchy, reports of a Spirit
which was in Love with a youngman, served him, solicited him in diverse forms,
and stealing money bought him many things wherein he delighted. Michel
Pselho, makes six kinds of these Spirits, Fiery, Ayrie, Earthy, Watery,
Subteranians, and fire flying Spirits: In all which Authors one may see, their
properties, their illusions, and their remedies.

The light of the Day, which is the amiable and illustrious Daughter of Heaven,
and the only guide of Mortals, did sufficiently assure Pamphilus, that now he
need not any more to fear the evil infestings of the Spirits: then waking
this good man, they both rise, and went together unto the Chamber, where
Pamphilus lay: but entering in to see the stir that was made the last night,
they found the bed, Pamphilus clothes, and all other things in the same place
where they had laid, without any appearance that they had been stirred.
Whereat Pamphilus being ashamed, with have made himself ready without speaking
a word, and thinking that this good Hermit would account him for a great Liar,
and a man of weak courage, departed from him, and thence took his way toward
Gadalupe without once daring to turn his head toward the City, vowing unto
himself, never to come into it again upon any occasion whatsoever should
happen, if he were not assured to find his Nisa there.

There are two Hills in the confines of the Mountain of Morena, which as two
strong walls do inuiron the Town and Monastery of Gadalupe, with so many
Fountains which do run from the Rocks into the bottom of the Valley, so
much Fruit and so much grain of all sorts, that it seems Nature knowing that
which should happen, had destined this place from the beginning of the world,
to build this Palace to the Princess of Heaven. The Pilgrim being come
thither, and having adored the Virgin, visited the Temple, and paid his vow:
as he went back again down the stayres, at that time of the year when as
the Sun is equally distant between the two Poles; he met a Passenger going
toward the Temple, who earnestly beholding him, asked him, if he had not
known either there or in any other place, a Pilgrim of Madreele called
Pamphilus, who lately was in Arragon. Pamphilus troubled with this demand, and
fearing that he was sought after with some warrant from the Justice, for
Godfreys death, turned back and fled toward the Temple; But the Aragonise by
some tokens which were given him, and by his sudden flying, presuming that it
was he, followed him and courteously calling him, said, stay Knight; I am not
come to apprehend you, neither does the privilege of this place permit any man
to be arrested Prisoner here. It is only a Letter from a young Lady called
Flerida, which I bring you: see thereby what I am, and for what occasion I
seek you. Pamphilus then staying took the Letter, and having opened it, found
the contents as follows.

To the Pilgrim of Madreele.
THou thy self O Pamphilus may judge in what care thou lefts me, if thou
have had never so little thought of me since thou left me. And now as well to
satisfy my self as to know how thy misfortunes are determined, have I sent
this Messenger unto you. My Brothers being returned and missing thee in the
Prison where they had left thee, witnessed more sorrow for thy departure, then
for my brother Godfreys death. But a few days after, a woman of the Country
falling out with another, amongst other words, (which choler provoked, a
thing ordinary amongst women) said she was the cause of Godfrey his Death.
Being thereupon taken, and having confessed that Tansiles killed him out of
Jealousy, he was apprehended, and the crime being verified, the third day
after he had his Head cut off. My Mother and my Brother being now assured of
thy Innocence, do bewail their hard usage toward thee, and have made great
search to find thee. If thou will return, they will redeem the injury of
thy unjust Imprisonment, with imbracings and kind usage, and thou shall
thereby pay me for the desire which I continually have of thy welfare, and for
the tears which thou have cost me.

The Pilgrim wondered at Tansiles strange success, and was something moved in
his mind with Flerida's loving desires: But fearing to offend Nisa, he
satisfied the Messenger as well as he could, giving him the Jewels which
Flerida had given him, entreating that he would secretly deliver them; together
with a most kind Letter unto her, which he presently writ, and so the same
day dispatched away the Messenger, who went his way very joyful that he had in
so short a time so happily dispatched his business: For Flerida not thinking he
could easily find him, had commanded him to search him, in every house where
Pilgrims were used to Lodge throughout all Spain. I do here remember that I
heard Pamphilus say, after he had retired himself to covert from the storm of
his Fortunes, that he never in all his life, found any thing so difficult, as
to resist Flerida's desire, for besides the obligations wherein he stood tied,
which were very great and no less then for his life, she was most perfectly
fair; yet he continued his loving friendship by Letters, not only with her,
but with her Brothers also, until that she being Married with a Knight of
Andaluzia was carried into the Indyes.

Ten times had the Sun circled Heaven in the time of the year when as
Astrea does equal the balances of the Equinoctial, when Pamphilus iournying
night and day through Deserts and unknow ways, found himself one morning
when the Day began to smile on him at the side of craggy Mountains, oppressed
both with wearisomnes and hunger, and much more with the remembrance of Nisa*
Where sitting at the foot of an Oak beholding the solitarines of the Fields,
and the murmuring of the little Brooks which fell precipitatly from the
Mountain, he heard a Flute played upon, unto the sound whereof turning his
eyes, he saw a man sitting between two Rocks, amidst a flock of Sheep,
which seemed to leave their feeding to hearken to his Music.

But Pamphilus having other discourses in his head, went unto him, and wishing
health unto him, (which he could not obtain for himself) and courteously
again saluted by the Shepherd, who having nothing that sauoured of rusticknes
but his Apparel, made him know in a few reasons his understanding; and the
other quickly discerned in the Pilgrim, that he had more need of meat, then
discourse. Wherefore getting fire out of two Laurel sticks, which for that
purpose he carried with him, they poorly fed of that which Fabio (for so was
this Shepherd called) had willingly dressed, the ground serving them for a
Table, the grass for napkins, and bubling Brooks for their drink and
music, They passed away the best part of the day in telling their adventures:
and when it grew night, they retired themselves into a little Village, whether
Fabio led Pamphilus to keep his masters Oxen, who was a Farmer of a Grange
which Nisa her Father had in the Mountains. Pamphilus was glad of this
condition, hoping that by this means he might with time have news of his
Mistres, by the way Pamphilus entreated Fabio to relate the cause of his
retiring into this place, who although that this request brought unto his mind
a great deal of grief and passion, yet after some sighs he shortly told
him, that he was borne in Biscay, and descended of most noble Parents, who
were careful to fit him in his youth, with quallities answerable unto his
Birth, wherein he profited so well, that he neither raised coffeehouse in
his Parents nor shame unto his Tutors; but after growing more ripe in years,
and incited with the courageous heat of youth. In those times, when the
English with their warlike Ships rauaged along our Coasts, as well of Spain
as the Islands, and oftentimes with their desperate resolutions, made themselves
masters of our Indian Gold, I put my self to Sea in one of the Kings
Armadoes, as well with an intent to gain honor by my valor, as experience in
those services, thereby to be the abler to serve my Country, wherein I was so
fortunate, (because I will not say too much) that I got command my self, and
by taking and executing two or three of those Pirates, was in a fair way both
of grace with the King, and renown in the world, when my eyes were the
instruments, whereby the most excellent and admirable beauty of Albiana
captiuated my heart, so powerfully, that all other courses set apart, I was
enforced to give my self wholly to her service, wherein after some small time,
I had so happy a progression, that she did confess she was obliged by my
perseverance, and by the opinion which the world held of me, to esteem of me
and of my service: thus happily in her favor I spent some time, until it
fortuned some English slaves which I had, endeavoring to make an escape, but
by my Soldiers and Marryners prevented, I inflicted a cruel punishment upon
them, bound thereunto by that common policy which exacteth from Masters, a
seueere hand over their mutinous Slaves; especially I used it toward one, who
more eminent then the rest, as well in regard of his person, as that he was a
chief author of their attempt, which Albiana with most earnest prayers unto me
sought to divert, were it out of a pitiful compassion, ordinary in most
women, or that she took any special liking unto him: But I having more care
at that time to execute my rage, then mindful of her importunity, (which I
did not think would have turned to that consequence) for example sake, which
as it is powerful, so is it most necessary, especially amongst men of our
profession, who serve our selves with multitudes of them, perseuered in having
him soundly punished. Whereat she discontented, though with little show
thereof, underhand wrought such means by her friends in Court, before I
imagined any such thing, that the Slave was by messenger from the Duke of
Lerma, and by warrant under the Kings hand fetched from me, and the next day
she did let me know that any denial to a Woman, effects her hatred; For she
sent me a Letter wherein she said, I was a cruel Monster, and that she was so
far from Loving and esteeming me, that she would ever hate my barbarous
Nature, and she wondered, that any valor could be lodged where cruelty had
such a habitation; to conclude she told me, that I should never come in her
sight, nor be where she might hear of my name. How grievous this was unto me
gentle Sir, may easily be gessed if you knew the extremity of my Love, which
was so much that I presently without the knowledge of any of my friends took
such order, as I could with my command, and retired my self into these Desert
places, where I am resolved under this disguised habit to end my days; seeing
that Albiana will have it so, who whether her complaints were just or no, or
whether they but serve to color her inconstancy, shall be always loved and
truly obayed by me, unto whom only this comfort is left, That though Life
has left me, Death will take me.

Before Fabio had finished this short discourse, they had discovered the
Village, where Alfesibus did keep Nisa's fathers Cattle, in the best house of
the Village, which for a Country house was a fair one, Alfesibus received
Pamphilus, and informed by Fabio of his intent, he agreed with him for wages;
and after an evil supper and a worse Lodging, he passed the night miserably.
And when morning appeared, Pamphilus went after his Oxen unto the solitary
Fields, where he lived some time free from the confused noyses of the Cities,
a good leisure to meditate upon his adventures.

In the mean time Nisa healed of her wounds, knew that she had received them
from her own Brother, out of Jealousy which he had conceived against her for
Finia. And entreating his good Host that he would have pity upon her blood,
by both their means his pardon and liberty was obtained, the one soliciting,
and the other forbearing the prosecution. One of the wounds which Nisa had
received was in her left side, and as in the Dressing it could not be avoided,
but that she was known to be a Woman, although she had coniured her Host to
keep it secret from his Family, yet it was impossible: Because that his Son
Thesander unhappily one day was at her dressing and transported so into his
mind the wounds which she had in her body, that within a few days, he
fell sick by force of this continual thought, not being able to receive into
his imagination any thought, but the desire of this beauty. For all the heaven
of Love, moves upon these two poles, Imagination, and Desire. And then his
body is as full of imaginary and fantastic figures, as the Astrologians
Globe. Thesander did all that he could to divert himself from this thought,
and as evils are healed by their contraries, he proposed unto his eyes other
objects, and other cares unto his imaginations: But as Art is made out of many
experiences, which were wanting unto Thesander, he rather found the evil then
the remedy. For it is impossible that young men should know much, because that
to be wise requires experience, and that is gotten with time.

Nisa was much grieved at Thesanders passion, although he had never spoken
unto her about it. But as he which is Amorous so often speaks as he looks
upon that which he loves, she easily read* in his looks the depth of his
thoughts; and willing to disabuse him so, that not being understood by others,
she might let him understand the vanity of his Love, one night after she was
healed, being entreated by all the company, she sung these Verses following.

I wot not what is Love, nor yet his flame,
Nay more, to know it I have not the mnde:
In others, it will suffice a man may find,
The woes this Tyrant in their souls does frame.
That I for him do sigh he cannot say,
He mastreth not my will, that bideth free:
His bad and my good Nature disagree,
And free, me from his Empires Laws for aye.
To cast his Darts else where, I him require,
My heart (as Rocks of brass) does scorn his might:
Let him not grieve, I from him take my flight,
Because I am all ye, and he all fire.
But they rather increased the fire which was too much kindled in Thesanders
soul, who taking the Lute from Nisa, answered her with these Verses, which he
had conceived in his mind the night before.

The great Gods supreme puisant to deny,
Unto my soul as rashness I do hold:
This to deny with truth I may be bold:
Mine evil, nor yet my self I can desory.
My knowledge, Love has ravished whom you blame,
I think he has no might nor yet discretion:
If I be thus tormented for Confession.
You that deny his power feel not the same.
He makes the widest breach in strongest Brass,
From coldest ice, he greatest fire can draw:
Not one can ftye him; for none ever saw,
Ought else his shafts in swiftnes to surpass.
Very aptly might Nisa at that time have revenged, the motions which Pamphilus
had to agree unto* Flerida's will: It Love had been a Spirit, (as some have
believed) which might have toled them unto her.

But it was not just that so rare a Faith should be spotted with any infamy.
Thesanders Love in the mean time, springing from this first sparkle increased
by Nisa's resistance, like a Fire which a little Water makes more violent; or
like Palm Trees growing most, when a weight is laid upon them.

Nisa waxed strong and walked abroad, when desperate Thesander discovered
himself unto a Physician, who encouraged him either to manifest his evil, or
else as the best remedy, against his Love to work from his imagination, this
deep melancholy, and to divert it by some honest exercise, and that the
courage of the practiser is the first matter upon which the Heavens do imprint
the form of their succors, for as much as their favor is not obtained by
womanish prayers and vows but by the vigorius actions of men, agreeing unto
which the Greek adage says that the Gods do sell their blessings unto men,
in exchange of their labors. Thesander was animated by these counsels, but
finding that divisions were weak remedies against the splendour of Nisas
beauty, he fell into a relapse, and grew so weak that he was constrained to
discover the cause of his sickness. The pitiful Father who was already
informed of Nisa's quality, coniured her with tears, to be Mistres of his
wealth, and marry his Son, of whose sickness there was no other remedy: Nisa
admiring at the several ways, whereby Fortune sought to separate her from
Pamphilus, discovered then unto the good old man, the whole history of her
life, and laid before him all the impossibilities which did excuse her from
satisfiing so many courtesies; the chiefest whereof was, in his willingness to
admit her to the highest degree of Honor and affection that was possible for
him to do, she being a stranger, and in such an indecent habit, for a woman
fit to be his Sons wife. By this means she satisfied the Father: But the
poor Thesander was so desperate, that falling into greater extremity, he was
at the last point of his life; like unto Trees whose boughs do not loose
their greenenes, until that their humor which does quicken them do
absolutely fail, because that hope is the radical moisture which does keep
us alive, and is unto us as Oil unto our fire. Nisa seeing that Thesander was
for her sake upon the point of losing his life, and she herself, had not now
lived, but out of his Fathers pity, was exceedingly perplexed, that she could
not satisfy so just an obligation: and not being able to rest in these
confused thoughts, the representations of Pamphilus labors did always appear
in her mind, who she thought to be Prisoner still at Valence. Thesanders evil
increased, Nisa deferred the remedy, and the Father accused this poor amorous
man, in my opinion innocent, because, that in things natural, we do neither
merit nor Demerit: In brief, all the whole family entreated Nisa that she
would have pity of Thesanders young years, and that at the least she would
assuage his passion with one amorous word.

Amongst all the variable Fortunes as well by Land as Sea, which our Pilgrim had
suffered, there was none so difficult unto her as this. Nevertheless she
resolved to entertain Thesander, until he had recovered some strength, that
thereby he might the better be able to bear the subtilty which she intended.
And in this she did not deceive herself, for our spirits, have some
resemblance with the nature of young Horses, which are easilyer managed with
gentle Bits then with hard; The sweet words, the fained hopes, and imbracings
of Nisa within few days restored Thesanders weakened spirit, during which
time, Celio was delivered out of Prison, with an exceeding desire to see her,
as well because he had heard news of her health, as because he imagined, that
if Finia were not in her company, yet at the least he might hear some news of
her. Nevertheless the sorrowful Nisa believing that Celio desired to kill her,
not knowing what Pamphilus had told him of her disguising in the habit of a
Pilgrim; so soon as she heard of his enlargement, fled secretly from Barcelon.
In the mean time Lisard the Eldest brother unto Celio and Nisa, who as you
heard, was a Soldier in Flanders, Disimbarquing in the same Town of Barcelon,
far from thinking that persons so near him were there: having met with Finia
upon the way, on the first day of her travel, although almost in the last of
the tragecall* Comedy of her fortunes, sorry to see so fair a Pilgrim go a
foot, understanding which way she was bound, offered to accompany her into
Casteele: Finia willing to be gone from Celio, whom she thought never to be
able to appease, and not knowing that this was his Brother, accpteth his offer,
and goes with him to Toledo. Where being received of his Parents with all
kind of Joy, his desire was that Finia might also be well entertained and
kindly used, telling them in what manner he had found her, his Parents received
her with a great deal of honor and imbracings, yet not without some
suspicions that she was some spoil of the Flanders war. Lisard then asked for
his Brother Celio and for his Sister Nisa, they telling him the cause of their
absence. Finia thereby knew that the house whereinto she was come, was her
husbands Fathers, and that he who had brought her thither, was his Brother,
whereat not sufficiently wondering, she then thought that Fortune began to
look upon her misfortunes, with a more clear countenance.

The day following, Lisard resolving to go seek for his sister Nisa, and to
kill Pamphilus, told his Parents that he had some pretentions at the Court,
upon which he built the necessity of a new voyage, showing them some
attestations in writing of that which he had done in Flanders, for which he
hoped of good recompense. His Father perspicuosly knowing his mind through his
reasons, wherewith he endeavored to color his Journey, and fearing to loose
him with the other, propounded a thousand objections, telling that he should
now rest after his voyage, and from the travels of War, contenting himself
with the honor which he had gotten, because that in this age the reward did
fly from the merit. Lisard thus persuaded by his Father, remained in the house
although it grieved him, that after he had bought so much renown with the
loss of his blood so far from his own Country, he should now lie still and
rust with infamy; finally being discontent, that he was beheld as he thought
with this mark, he went into the Country, to shun the first encounter of the
peoples sight, into the same Village, where amongst the other servants of his
Fathers farmer, Pamphilus lived, who was never before known of Lisard; and as
one day he beheld him more curiously then he did all the others, for hardly
could the baseness and indignity of his habit disguise his person and beauty;
he called him unto him, and informing himself of the cause, why he lived in
this base office: The excuses which he made, did not seem current, (indeed
being fained by Pamphilus, who already knew that Lisard was Nisa's eldest
Brother.) Wherefore Lisard said unto him, that he should do better, if leaving
this rusticke life, he would abide in his service and take the charge of two
Horses which he had, for which he would give him wages, and convenient clothes;
Pamphilus refused this offer, not that he was not willing to return into this
happy house, in which he had first known Nisa: But fearing that being known
in her absence, he should run a dangerous fortune of his life. Nevertheless,
being weary of the austere life which he led amongst these Mountains, for
there is nothing more true (as the Philosophers say) then that those which are
solitary are either Gods or Devils; he resolved in the end to accept of this
condition, wishing rather that he might Dye by Nisa's Parents hands, then Live
any longer in these solitary Deserts.

Now you see how forward we are in bringing back our Pilgrim from his long
travels, seeing that from being a Courtier, he became a Soldier; from a
soldier, a Captive; from a captive, a Pilgrim; from a Pilgrim, a Prisoner; from
a Prisoner a Madman; from a Madman, a Herdsman; from a Herdsman, a miserable
Lacky, in the same house where all his misfortunes began: To the end that you
seeing this circle of fortune from one Pole unto another, without one moment of
rest, or any of good, in the beginning, middle, or end of his adventures: you
may learn to know, how travailing abroad brings honor, and profit, and many
times the contrary. All consists in the disposition of Heaven, whose
influence guide the passages of our life, as it pleases them; because that
although the empire of free will be above, yet few persons be found who do
resist their motions; It is therefore a weakness unworthy of a gentle heart, not
to dare hazardously to enterprise any thing, seeing it is evident, that if
those who have effected great things, had not begun them, they had never
atchiued them, As also hazardous enterprises belong only to brave courages;
although Heaven dispose of the success. Above all things the election
imports much, as Propertius says, all things are not equal unto all.
Seneca tells of an old man who being asked, how he could live unto those
years in following the Court; answered, that it was in doing good turns and
not excepting agaiust injuries; But this patience does not seem honorable
unto me, nor that it is any virtue to serve to Live. And if Posterity does
render unto every body his honor as Tacitus says, what renown can he leave
behind him, who dies as it were in the cradle, and from his swaddling cloutes
unto his hearse, has hardly shifted a shirt; like unto the Plant, which has
the form of a living Lamb, the stock whereof growing out of the ground unto
the stomach, and not being able to eat more grass, then that which grows
round about it, dies for want of nourishment. Glorious was Darius, when being
come unto the River Tearus, which takes his beginning from two Fountains,
whereof the one is hot and the other cold, he caused the famous inscription
whereof Herodalus speaks to be made; to this place, against the Scitheans
came, the most famous of all other men, Darius the son of Hidaspes. Who has
ever obtained any thing without running for it? Who has ever run for it, if
he have not seen it? and what rest can he know, who has never proved any
storm or adversity by Sea or Land? For there are no days so sweet and
comfortable, as those which we spend in the arms of our friends, after long
travel and great dangers; nor any nights so sweet, as those which are spent
about the fire with an attentive Family, unto the discourses of ones former
dangers and adventures; As Ulysses within Zacinth unto his dear Penelope, and
his Son Telemaquus. So after many diverse adventures, Pamphilus comes unto the
happy day of his rest, and though he were not at the siege of Troy, not at the
Conquest of the new World with Cortes, yet it was no small valor in him, to
defend himself from so many different and perilous assaults of Fortune, and in
the end to have merited by so many labors, the rest which shortly he shall
enjoy in his own Country.

Whilst these things thus passed in the Mountains of Toledo, Thesander being
recovered by Nisa's loving imbracings, and she disposed to leave him, as well
because his life was assured as because that she desired to assure hers, and
deliver herself from the care wherewith she was searched after by her Brother
Celio.

One night when sleep mastered her Lovers senses, and held a silence over the
whole Family, she went out of the City, and takes the way toward Lerida. But
night had hardly all hid her black head, crowned both with sleep and fear,
when the deceived Thesander waked out of the most sorrowful Dream that could
possess his fantasy, representing to his imagination, the absence of fugitive
Nisa, together with her deceitful words, her sweet disdaines, and her fair
^ace; a thing which sometime happens, principally unto him which loves or
fears. In as much as those things which threaten us, do represent unto us in
sleeping, the same cares which we have in the day awake. Thesander rising in
this imagination, began to search Nisa guided by the light of his soul, and
not finding her, it little wanted that he did not dye with grief for her
departure; neither his Father, nor the rest of his Parents had power enough to
keep him from running after. And so he came to Toledo long time before Nisa.
For a Lover whofoloweth that which he loves, does go faster, then he who
flies from that which he does not love; because he which does not love
grows sorrowful in going, and he which loves, by going puts off his grief.

In the mean time, Lisard much pleased with Pamphilus, his understanding and
person, had taken him to wait in his Chamber, not suffering him to live in the
baseness of his first office which he had given him, and in this quality he
lived at Toledo with his Master, always taking great care, that his masters
Parents might not see him, because that if they had viewed him with any
consideration, they must needs have known him. But Lisard who with frequent
conversation with Finia, (whom his Parents did use as lovingly as they could
have done Nisa) was fallen in Love with her, discovered one time unto
Pamphilus, and making him the minister of his passion, gave him charge to
speak unto her, and to dispose her, (with all his power) to be favorable unto
his desires; Pamphilus obeying his Master, and taking occasion one Festival
day, when every body was abroad, he went to find Finia from Lisard: But when
in coming unto her he knew her to be his Sister, and she knew him to be
her Brother, they both remained astonished, dumb, and as immouable as stones.
But shortly after this first confusion, Pamphilus began to speak in this
manner: Sister tell me by what means thou came hither, since Celio
abandoning thee left thee in Barcelon, for I know already the whole progress
of thy misfortune, as conformable unto mine as we are equal in Birth.

By his means whom the Destinies pleased, unto whose disposing my will cannot
resist: Lisard brother of my Husband Celio, having found me upon the way from
Saragossa brought me hither, where I think, I may abide his return with more
honor. The same man said Pamphilus, sends me unto thee to speak unto thee
about his Love, and he having found me in a Grange which he has in the
Mountains of Toledo, where I had sheltered my self, from the strokes of
Fortune, under the basest condition of the world, has brought me now into this
place where thou now see me in the quality of a Groom; and because that
heretofore in the beginning of my Fortunes I have been in this house, I kept
my self from being seen until this time, as thou may well know, having
not been seen until this day by thee. Suffer and abide the end of thy
Fortune as I have done, and do not say thou know me, for I will entertain
Lisard with some Lie from thee, until such time, that we may see whereunto
the revolution of this conjunction of our misfortunes will tend, and when will
end the effects of this our honors eclipse. Thus did Pamphilus and Finia
meet, and in stead of reprehending one the other, they remained there both
good friends, for it is ordinary with those who are culpable, to dissemble the
faults of others, least they be reprehended for their own. In this mean time,
Thesander went from place to place in Toledo inquiring for Nisa, and when these
news came unto Lisards ears, that there was a young man which enquired for
his Sister; He verily thought that it was Pamphilus, who by some sinister
accident having lost her, was come thither to find her. And telling unto
Pamphilus the story of Nisa's rauishing, which he knew much better, told him,
that he was now in Toledo in her quest; and that having no man, in whose hands
he could better commit the satisfaction of his revenge, then his, nor of whose
courage and fidelity he could be better assured of; he entreats him, and
coniures him to kill him. A notable winding in a success so strange and so
imbroiled, which is so much the more admirable unto me, who know it better
then they who reads it, how true it is.

Pamphilus astonished, to see that he was engaged to kill Pamphilus, at the
least a man, who either in searching for Nisa, or else one who for the only
disaster of his name deserved to dye, endeauoreth to find him, rather to know
what he would with Nisa, then with any mind to execute Lisards intent upon the
others innocence. His master did not accompany him in this action; for as
Tacitus says of Nero, although he commanded Murders, yet he always turned
his sight away from them.

Pamphilus having found Thesander privately, would inform himself of the
cause why he inquired for Nisa: Thesander recounted the story from Nisa's being
wounded by Celio, and healed by his Father, she had left them one night
without bidding them adue, paying with ingratitude all the good offices which
were done her in that house. Neither did he forget to relate how she (for the
dressing of her wound) being constrained to open her breasts, she was
discovered to be a Woman; from whence proceeded his desire, and the cause why
he sought her in this place, which she said was the place of her Birth.
Joyful was Pamphilus to hear of the healing of Nisa's wounds, and in stead of
killing Thesander he led him into his Chamber, where having used him with all
the courtesy that was possible, he told him that in this house where he
remained, were Nisa's Parents and Brother.

Lisard having a great opinion of Pamphilus his courage, whom he called
Maurice, did verily believe that he would infallibly kill Nisa's rauisher,
which he believed to be Thesander, wherefore he demanded leave of his Father
to go, fearing that if Maurice should happily be taken Prisoner, he might
confess the author of Pamphilus his death. The Father afflicted at his
departure, fearing that in this his age, Death might take him in the absence of
all his Children, would know the cause of his Journey: And Lisard telling him
that he had sent to kill him, who had run away with his Sister, who was come
unto Toledo, and that he did believe, that his servant unto whom he had given
this commission had already executed it, put the old man into a greater care
then he was in before, much fearing the Damage which might come from so
violent a revenge: Pamphilus had persuaded Thesander, to call himself
Pamphilus unto all those, who should ask his name in Toledo, assuring him that
he should the sooner hear news of Nisa: In this time Lisard and his Father
coming into Pamphilus his Chamber, to know how he had succeeded in the
execution of his command, found Pamphilus and Thesander together. They
demanded of Thesander what he was, who answered; that he was Pamphilus.
Lisard draws out his Sword instantly to kill him, but he was withheld by his
Father, who having already known Pamphilus told his son, that the other was
Pamphilus. Lisard believed that his Father told him so to appease him,
wherefore he fiereely strove to break away from his Father, that he might
kill Thesander, saying that the other was his man Maierice. The whole Family
drawn thither by the noise, and seeing this rage to prevent greater mischief,
tanne unto the Magistrates, who hearing the stir raising the Neighbors,
laid Pamphilus and Thesander in two several Prisons, until it was verified
which was Pamphilus, for although that Thesander apprehending the danger, began
now to say that it was not he, was not believed: for all believed that fear
made him deny his name. In this mean time Iacinth being whole of his wounds,
which Pamphilus had given him, sought him all over Barcelon, and not finding
him, believed that he was returned into his own Country, as well to follow
him, as hearing that his Lucinda was at Madreele, resolved to go thither, and
passing by Saragossa he found the Pilgrim Nisa, at the entrance of the famous
Pillar which was built by the Angels in the time of the Apostle, who planted
Religion in Spain, and having (by many tokens which Pamphilus had told him,
and marked her out unto him) known her; he also made himself known, for
Iacinth. Nisa assuring herself of him, out of the Love which she knew was
between him and Pamphilus, betook her unto a habit proper unto her sex, and
left this Pilgrims apparel at the walls of this Holy house; together with her
Staff, which in so many dangers and such long ways had been so faithful a
companion; And so travailing together toward Madreele, Nisa desired to seek
Pamphilus first in his own house, whether being come with Iacinth, and finding
his sorrowful Mother afflicted, for the loss of her Children, she comforted
her much by the assurance which she gave unto her, that they were both alive,
and the hope they put her in to find them at Toledo: The good old Lady
encouraged by these words, and persuaded by Nisa, and the great desire she had
to see her Children, took her youngest daughter Eliza with her, (being her
staff and her comfort in her afflictions, who in her Brothers absence, had
increased no less in Beauty then Finia, nor in understanding then Pamphilus)
and went all together to Toledo.

The miserable Tiberia, Iacinths Sister, thinking that her treason being
discovered, she should be hardly used by her Brother, as by the disgrace and
danger whereunto she had unjustly exposed him she merited; leaves Valence, and
with such of the family as would follow her, she addressed herself unto that
City, whether Fortune already did seem to call these Lovers:

Celio in the mean time dispayring to find Finia or satisfy Nisa, he for
his part being more then satisfied, of both their innocencies, returned to
Toledo, and some days before his coming thither he met Tiberia, in whose
company as he iourneyed, he heard news of the Combat between Iacinth and
Pamphilus, for which cause he offered her his house to retire unto, until such
time, as that writing unto her Brother, she had made her peace with him, which
might be done by the help of his Parents, whose help and assistance he
promised.

In this manner in one Day, and in one time, entered into the noble Leonicios
House; Aureliana, Pamphilus Mother, Nisa, and Eliza, Iacinth, Tiberia, and he
who was most dispaired of, Celio, of whom there was no news expected, being
accounted as Dead, or Captive as some had reported. The sudden joy to see Nisa
so beautiful, and Celio so well, stronger in this habit then in that which
he had brought home from his studies, before his peregrination, bound Leonicio
to shed abundance of tears, and Aureliana could not forbear when she saw
her dear Finia so long time lost, and Celio with tender imbracings, demanded
pardon for his causeless suspicions, and of Nisa for the wounds which he had
given her, being ignorant what she was. There was none discontented but
Iacinth, who seeing his Sister Tiberia in this company, without knowing how
she came thither, would needs take a public satisfaction before all the
world. But the authority of so many signal persons not only stayed him, but
obtained pardon from him for his Sisters offense. Thesander and Pamphilus were
taken out of Prison, and then it was quickly known who was the true Pamphilus,
whose happy finding there, did so rejoice the whole company, and the whole
Town, that all the Nobility and Gentry ran for to see him, and rejoice with
their Parents for their happy arrival; Amongst all which came unto this happy
and Joyful welcomming home, fair Lucinda, who was married to Iacinth, to
satisfy the many Obligations wherein she was redueable. Lisard having opened
his eyes upon Tiberia's beauty, and by the impression, which the report of
Celio's Love and Finia's made in his mind, clean wiped away his Affection of
that kind unto Finia, he entreated Iacinth to give her unto him in Marriage,
which was easily granted, and with every ones consent. And to comfort
Thesander for the Love which he bare unto Nisa, he was Married unto fair
Eliza, Pamphilus Sister, then about fourteen year old. Celio with Joy unto
all, married Finia. And Nisa after so many diverse fortunes, with the Joy of
both their Parents, (which was so full that it melted them into tears, and
almost all the company) was given into the beloved arms of her most Dear
Pamphilus.

The Authors percration in manner of an Apostrophe.
Happy Pilgrims of Love, your vows being accomplished, now rest happily and
Joyfully (after so many bitter Fortunes, wherewith your Loves have been
seasoned) in the sweet repose of your Native place, in which peace I will leave
you, that you may enjoy your Delights which you have merited: And seeing that I
have left your Staves in the Temple, I will leave in the Temple of renown, the
Pen with which I writ your unfortunate loves.

FINIS.
