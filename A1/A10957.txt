20. ARTICLE. Of the authority of the Church.
THe Church has power 1 to decree rites or ceremonies, and authority 3 in
controversies of faith. And yet it is not laufull for the Church 2 to ordain
any thing that is contrary to Gods word, 4 neither may it so expound one
place of Scripture 5 that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore although 6 the
Church be a witness, and a keeper of holy writ: yet, as it ought not to
decree any thing against the same, so besides the same 7 ought it not to
enforce any thing to be believed for necessity of salvation.

The Propositions.
1 The Church has power to decree rites or ceremonies. 2 The Church may not
appoint what rites or ceremonies it will. 3 The Church has auctortie to judge
in controversies of faith. 4 The Church has power to interpret, and expound
the word of God. 5 The Analogy of faith must be expected in the exposition
of the Scripture. 6 The Church is the witness and keeper of Gods word. 7 The
Church may not enforce any thing to be believed, as is necessary unto
salvation, that is either contrary, or besides the word of God.
1 The Churches authority to decree rites or ceremonies.
Is warranted in the word of God, By the example of the Apostles who did
ordain rites or ceremonies, as among other things, that in the Church Men
should not be covered. 1. Corinthians. 11. 4. etc. Women Should be covered. 1. Corinthians. 11. 5. Should keep silence. 1. Corinthians 14. 34.
A known tongue should be used. 1. Cor. 14. 1. etc.
By the general, and perpetual commandment of God himself who at al times
will have every thing in the Church to be done As being the auctor not of
confusion, but of peace. 1. Cor. 14. ver. 26. 33. 40.
Honestly, By order, Unto aedification,

Is granted in the public Confessions of the Churches protestant, as
Confession of Heluet. 1. Artic. 13. Heluet. 2. cap. 22. 23. 24. Basil* art. 10.

15. Sax. artic. 20. Sucuia. cap. 8. 14. VVittem. cap. 27. 35. This power being
given by the supreme authority unto the Church, theie do greatly offend,
Who by an extreme detestation conceived against ceremonies, do condemn
Generally, al rites or ceremonies, as do some fantastical spirits.
Particularly some commendable ceremonies: so is the celebration of the Sabbat
disliked of certain Familists.
Which think the Church is tied precisely to observe the ceremonies, Of the
Jews, so Did the False Apostles, Cerdonits Cerinthians. Nazarens.
Do the Jews. Turks. Armenians.

Of the Romish synagogue, in which error be The hot Papists. The half
Papists, the Fam* of Love.

Which hold that either any one man, or any certain calling has power to
decree and appoint rites or ceremonies, though of themselves good unto the
whole Church of God.


2. As it is a clear truth that the church may ordain ceremonies: So true it
is also that the Church has no power to appoint what rites or ceremonies it
will, but they must make
To the Nourishing and increase of love and friendship among men, Such
Reteining of the faithful in the holy fear of God Such In the primative
Church were the rites principalie about Baptism. Excommunication. The L.
Supper.
In these dais in the reformed Churches, are the ceremonies touching For the
Church to meet in.
The times. The places.
In the Church.
The prayers. The service. The persons.


Not to the upholding of vice, or superstitious vanities among the people, as
theie do If of themselves theie be meetlie wiked and ungodly, as are Popish
Masses. Images in the Church.
If being in their own nature indifferent, yet being supersticiouslie used are
ungodly, as are the difference of days, and meats, and apparel, etc. when it
is thought that such rites Do deserve remission of sins. Are th'acceptable
service of God. Be of necessity, under the pain of Gods eternal curse, to be
observed of al and every man. This is consonantor agreeable

As are of opinion that the Church has absolute authority to ordain what
laws, rites, or ceremonies it thinks good. As will make (and that as theie
say by th^auctoritie given unto the church) of a ceremony, a matter of
substance, and of a thing of substance, a ceremony, as theie do which turn
the 2 commandments of the Decaloge into a ceremonial law. As both obscure the
glory of God by their Masses, invocation of creatures, etc. and frustrate the
merits of our Savior by their meritorious pardons, fasting, pilgrimages, etc.
and deface the holy Sacraments of Christ, by the vain ceremonies of
Antichrist; and hinder the preaching of Gods word by over m^nie and tedious
traditions; and keep the people of God in damnable ignorance, by preferring the
ordinances of me^ before th'institution of God, and leave that undone which God
has commanded to be done, to perform that which the Church has commanded;
such are the Papists.





3 Authority is given to the Church (and to every member of judgment in the
same) to judge in controversies of faith, and so in their places
To embrace the truth. To avoid and improve Antichristianitie and errors. And
this is not the private opinion of our Church but

Which being not of the Church of Christ, will notwithstanding take upon them

Which hold that the Pope alone has power To judge al men, and matters, but
may be judged of none. To make and revoke at his p^^su^e what articles of
Religion him lists, and that without controlment.
Which suppose there is No judgment but in the Clergy, so called. None
authority to determine of controversies in Religion, but by the books of the
dead Fathers. Doctors. Schole men, as Th^^ Aquinas. ^co^^^, etc.






4 To interpret the word of God is a peculiar blessing given by God only to
the church or company of the faithful, though not to al and every of them. For
Says our Savior Of men in general. No man knows the Son, but the Father;
neither knows any man the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son
will reueile him. Mat. 11. 27. Of his faithful disciples. It is given to you to
know the secrets of heaven, but to them it is not given. Matthew. 13, 11.

Says S. Paul unto the church at Corinth
The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For
to one is given by the Spirit, the word of wisdom, etc. And to another
prophecy. 1. Cor. 12. 7, etc. If any thing be reueiled to another that
sits by, let the first hold his peace. 1. Cor. 14. 30.
The Apostles, James and John, do write unto all the Church, or people of God.
If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God. Iam. 1, 5. Ye have an ointment
from him that is holy, and ye have known al things, etc, ye know the truth,
etc, ye need not that any man teach you. 1. John. 2. ver. 20, 21, 27. Hereunto
subscribe the Churches in
Heluet. Confess. 2. c. 7. Bohem. Confess. c. 1. VVitte^. Confess. c. 30. Al of us
jointly opposing our selves
Against those men which think that to expound the word of God is so easy a
matter, as any student, endued with a good natural wit, by diligence may do
the same Against them that teach how to interpret or expound the Scriptures is
too hard a thing for any mortal man to attain unto: such Was Johannes de
VVessalia. Are many of the Anabaptists.
Against the fam. of Love, who though they grant some can expound or open, so
far as is convenient for man to know, the meaning of God in his word: yet that
Some, there say, are themselves, and none other. Against the Papists Which
think that to interpret the holy scripture is not so much a special gift of
God upon some chosen persons, as an ordinary power annexed to the state of
Popes. Bishops. General Councels
That are so far from giving the people of God, not being of the Clergy, power
to expound* that theie vvil not suffer them to read, no not so much as to have
the Scriptures in a vulgar tongue, except it be their own most corrupt, and
barbarous translation, which but of late years neither, and that in part too,
is granted. But for the Scripture of God in place theie obtruded Festiuals
Legends Rosaries Horaries Psal^eries of our Lady.





5 For So Much as no prophecy is of any private motion (2. Pet. 1. 20.) and
whatsoever interpretation man gives, not agreeing to Th'analogie of faith
(which S. Paul from God gave in commandment to be observed, Romans 12. 6.) is a
private interpretation, special heed is to be had that one place of Scripture
be so expounded as it agree with another, and al to the proportion of faith.
This do the Churches protestant so like of, as theie approve the same by
public Subscription, as may appear in the Confession of
Heluet. 1. art. 2. Heluet. 2. c, 2. France. art. 7. Saxon. art. 1. VVittem.
ca. 30. 31. 33. Sueauia. art 1. This will not be granted of the Antichristian
synagogues whereof
Some think that the Scripture may be expounded in what sense, and to what
purpose we will, as the Helchesaits. Papists: among whom theie be which from
this opinion do term the most holy word of God in reproach A shipma^^ hoase.
A leaden rule. A nose of wax.

Some condemn al interpretation of the word, as unnecessary, theie being
taught, as theie say, of God himse^lfe: such are the Libertines. Some depend
upon visions, and Revelations, as the Euthusiasts. Anabaptists.
Some dislike of the literal, calling it a Grammatical sense, and so prefer the
Allegorical exposition, that theie call it the spiritual sense of Gods word, and
therbie make what them list of the Scriptures most monstrouslie, as the
Originists. Fam. of Love
Some vvil have of every place of Scripture an exposition Analogical.
Allegorical. Historical. Moral. As the curious
Thomists. Monches.

Some are addicted to an interpretation which theie call mystical, and
prophetical, as the B^^^ardists. Some think th'interpretation which the
Church of Rome makes of the Scripture, whatsoever it be, is the od, and the
only true sense of Gods word, as Harding does. Some deem that as the Church
by time does alter, so th'interpretation of the Scripture also may vary:
whereby that which in The Apostles time was a truth, in these days shall be
an error, and contrariwise: in this error was Cardinal Cusanus.

6 Though the church has power to hear and determine in controversies of
says (as already has bine proved): yet has the Church authority nei there
to judge the word of God, not to judge otherwise than the word of God does
judge. For it is said,
To the church Now I besceche you brethren, mark the^ diligently which
cause division and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which ye learned, and
avoid them, Romans 16. 7. Hear him (even Christ) Math 17. 5. To him give all the
Prophets vvitnesce. Act. 10. 43. Search the Scriptures. John. 5. 39. Whosoever
transgresceth and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God 2. John.
verse. 9. Ye are no more strangers and forreners etc. and are built upon the
foundation of The Apostles, and Prophets, etc. Ephesians. 2 19. Hereby shall ye
know the spirit of God etc. 1. John. 4. 2.
Of the holy Scripture The word is the truth. John. 17. 17. The whole
Scripture etc, is profitable to teach, to improve, to correct, to instruct in
righteousness, that the man of God may be absolute, etc. 2. Tim. 6. ver. 16.
17. They have Moses, and the Prophets, let them hear them. Luke 16. 29. We
have also a most sure word of the Prophets, to the which ye do well that ye
take heed. etc. 2. Pet. 1. 19. If any man teach otherwise, and consents
not to the wholesome words of our L. I. Christ, and to the doctrine which is
according to godliness, he is pust up, and knows nothing, etc. 1. Tim. 6. v.
3. etc. Thus think we of the Scriptures, and of the Church. So with us do
other Churches. Confess. of
Heluet. 2. cap. 1. Bohem. cap. 1. Fran. art. 5. Flan. art 7. Wit. tem. art.
30 31. 32. Sax. art. 11. Yet al of us do grant that the Church.
As a faithful witness may yea, of necescitie must testify to the world, what
has bine the doctrine of God his people from time to time. But be it far from
us that we should ever so much as think, which the Papists vvil not stick to
write, and say, that The Church is to judge the Scripture, and not the
Scripture the Church. The Scripture is not of the escence of the Church, for
without it a Church mai^ be thought and veri^ well. So said Cusanus a
Cardinal. It had gonne better with the Church, had there bine no scripture at
al. The scripture because (as they say) It is imperfect cannot Be the judge. It
is obscure, may not Be the judge. It is ambiguous, ought not Be the judge.
He is an haereticke that cleaves to the Scriptures, as did Horstatus. Such as
bare witnesce unto the truth. By the shedding of their blood in the days of Q
Marie, are not martyrs, but murtherets of them selves. In this time By the
sword, are tyrans. By life and doctrine, be heretics.


As a trusty register is to keep and make known, what the word of god which
it has received, is This carefully has bine performed, Before the word was
written, by the Patriarchs. After the word was committed to writing, Before
Christ his incarnation by the Jews. In christ his life time, Luke 4. 16. etc
Act. 13. 27. Act. 15 21.
In the primitive church 2. Cor 3. 15. 2. cor. 8. 18. Colos. 3. 16.
From The Apostles time by the godly Christians in th'uniuersal world. This
carefulnes in keepinge the word of God, de clareth,
That the mother Church of Rome is not the only keeper of the holy write. How
cursedly theie offend which so greatly esteem, The Ethiks of Aristotle as
the S. scripture. The Ods of Pindar, as the Psalms of David. The writings of
men, as the word^ of God.






7 Of the people of God nothing must be obtruded upon the Church to be believed
as necessary unto salvation, which is either contrary or besides the word of
God,
So says the scripture. Deuteronomy. 4. 2. Prou. 30. 6 E^^k. 20. verse. 18. 19. 1.
Cor. 3. 11. Gal. 1. 8. Gal 3. 15. Ephe. 4. 14 Col. 1. 23. Heb. 13. 9. 2. John.

VVittem. cap. 30. 33 Sueuia. art. 1. What soever is grounded thereon, though
not by expres terms to be red therein, we do reuerendlie embrace. This makes
us not to deny
In doctrine. The Consubstantialitie of our S. Christ with the Father and the
holy Ghost, as the Arians did. A trinity of persons in the Godhead with the
Sabellians The justification of faith only with the Papists. The baptism of
Infantes, with Anabaptists.
In ceremonies any thing that tends unto Comlines Order. Edification. But
from the heart we abhor whatsoever agrees not with the cannon of the
Scripture, nor is grounded thereon. Hence detest we
All the old haereuks The phatisies. The Escees. The Sadduces. The Simonia^s.
The Menandeans. The Ebeonits. The Cerinthians. The Gnostikes. The Valentinians.
The Martians. etc. with The new prophets of Basilides The manifestatio^s of
Marcian. The mysteries of the Manichies The Idolaea of the Scithians. The
Symbonia of Th'archo^tikes. The Cabala of the Jews. The Alcaran of the Turks.
The Decretals of the Popes

Al were hae^etiks with their curssed opinions The Anabaptists, and of them
namely, The Daui-geo^ gain^. The Libertines The Viteleis. The Nicholaitans of
Harrie Nicholas.
Papists whereof Some commanded that all the laws of the Pope should be
taken, as confirmed by the mouth of God himself, so did Pope Agatho the first.
Some write, as Busgrad*, that if the pope believe there is no life to com, as
some Popes have done, we must believe it as an article of our faith: and if the
Pope carry innumerable souls to hell with him, yet he may not be judged: so
thought Pope Boniface the 8. Some have published a new Gospel, called,
Euangeli^m aeternum, and spiritus, S. which some say, does so far excel the
gospel of Christ as the ca^nel surpasceth the shel; the Sun the Moon; and the
light darkness.






21. ARTICLE. Of the authority of general Councels.
GEneral Councels 1 may not be gathered together without the commandment
and will of Princes. And when theie be gathered together 2 (for as much as theie
be an assembly of men, whereof al be not governed with the Spirit and word of
God) theie may err, and sometimes have erred,3 even in things pertaining
unto God. Wherefore4 things ordained by them, as necessary unto salvation,
have neither strength, nor authority, unless it may be declared that theie
be taken out of holy Scripture.

The Propositions.
1 General Councels must be gathered together, by the commandment and will of
Princes. 2 General Councels may err. 3 General Councels have erred even in
great matters of Religion. 4 The things ordained by general Councels, are so
far to be embraced and believed, as theie are consonant to Gods holy word.
1 Great is the power, and auctoiti^ of Kings and Princes by the word of God.
For, as the defense of Religion is committed unto the^: so must they see that
al men do their duties. That these things may the better be performed, they
are as just occasion is offered, not as men under the power of others to
summon, but as supreme governors within their territories and dominions to
command al sorts of men to meet together, and that either to th'inplanting
of the truth where it is not, or to the supprescing of sin, errors, idolatry,
and superstition where, or in whom soever it does arise, or is rooted. Such
Councels were holden,
In the time of the Mosaical government by the commandment of the most godly
Kings. Asa. 2. Chro. 15 9. etc. Ezekiah. 2. Chr. 29. 4 etc. Josiah. 1. Chro.
34. 29. etc.
Since the Gospel has bine received into Kingdoms and commonweals, by
Christian Princes, and Emperors, who gathered Councels General, so called was
the Council of Nice by Constantinus Magnus. Constantinople, by Theodosius the
elder. Ephesus, by Theodosius the younger. Calcedon by Marcian.
National, and prouincial, such (for all) were held at By the will of Charles the
Great
Franco^urt. Rhems Turon Cabilon. Arelot Moguntia
Auernia by Theodorit. Matiscon, by Gnutranus. By ^hil debert
Aurelia Paris, And never yet has there bine a council either general or
national, either public, or private (I only except the Councels held by the
holy Apostles in a troblesome state, and time of the church, when as yet there
were no christian Princes cou^tenauncing the truth) either begun or ended to
the glory of God. But it has bine, I say, not only called, but confirmed
also by some godly Emp. King. or Queen. This in effect is granted by the
confess.
Heluet. 2. cap. 30. Heluet. 1. art. 26. Bohem. cap, 16. Fland. art. 36. Sax.
art. 23. VVittem cap. 35. Sueuia in the Perorat. As al other godly and true
propositions besides; So has this bine oppugned, and that diverse lie. For some
think
That Emperors and Princes be the Pope his Summoners, and not of themselves
absolute commanders of Councels. There ought no Council to be kept without the
determinate consent of the Bishop of Rome. Harding. No Council ever yet had
firm authority, which was not confirmed by the Bishop of Rome. Du^aeus. The
Popes of Rome, whom theie call the successors of Peter (and not christian
Princes) have authority and power of making laws of calling Councels etc. The
Rhemists. upon the 16 of Matthew. That were the Pope a good man as he is
Antichrist, he might, or he being wiked, other good Bishops (though subjects
unto the civil Magistrate) may call Councels together at their discretion;
which derogateth not a little from th'auctoritie of a christian King, or
Prince.




2 General Councels consisting,
Of men, who may err, nothing more easily. Of many men and they differing
in Whereby distractions of opinions often do arise.
Yeates. Riches. Learning. Judgment. Calling. Authority
Of many men, whereof the wiked are for number commonly the mayor part, and
the better in outward countenance of the world. Of men, not al, nor always
Governed with the Of god.
Spirit word
Gathered together in the name of Christ. None of sound judgment in Religion,
do dout but they may err.
If Paphnutius had bin absent, at Nice the Council had erred. If Hierome had
bine away, at Calcedon the Council had erred At a^ie time, if some be
believed, be the Pope not present either perse, or per Legatum, no Council but
must err. Therefore Councels may err. That which one Council does establish
another vvil disanul. Theie vvil not (we must think,) revoke, that which is
well decreed. Therefore Councels may err. Therefore err do the Papists
which say
The holy Spirit alvvaies is the director of Councels. That Councels cannot
err.



3 Councels both general and particular have erred and that in matters of
faith, (Confess. VVittemb. cap. 33.) For
In the scripture we find that It was ordained if any man did confess that
Jesus was the Christ, he should be excommunicat, John 9. 22 John. 12. 42.
which could not be but by a Council. A Council was gathered to suppres Christ,
and his doctrine. John. 12. 47. A Council consulted how they might take Jesus
by subtlety and kill him. Mat. 26. v. 3. 4. A Council sought for witness
against Jesus to put him to death. Mar. 14. v. 53. 55. A Council bound Jesus,
and led him away, and delivered him to Pilate, Mar. 15. 1. A Council judged
our S. Christ A deceauer, Mat. 27. 63. A blasphemer, Luke 22. 71.
A Council corrupted the soldiers, and willed them to tell a lie. Matthew. 28.
ver. 12. 13. A Council with-stood Peter and John, and commuanded them that in
no wise they should speak or teach in the Name of Jesus. Act. 4. verse. 5. 6.
and 18. A Council Caused The Apostles to be beaten. Act. 5. 40. Commanded that
The Apostles should not prech in the Name of Jesus. Act. 5. 40.
In ancient writings of credit we may read how, contrary to Gods word By
Councels A^^ianisme has bine confirmed. By Councels the books of foolish men
have bin made of equal authority with the word of God. By Councels Has bin
established.
Adoration of images Invocation of creatures, etc.
By Councels th'auctoritie of Princes has bine depresced, and the Pope and
Clergy advanced above all Princes. The truth hereof moved
Hilary to call the Synod of Mediolane, the Synagogue of the malignant. Saint
Augustine unto Maximinus to write, Neither ought I to obiecte against thee the
Synod of Nice, nor thou against me the Synod of Ariminum. Nazianzen openly
to pronounce that he never saw any good end of a Council. The French King
his Ambassador to sa^e in the chapter of Trent, that scarsely any good at all,
or very little came by Councels to the state of christendom. Cornelius,
Bishop of Bitonto, to break out into these words in the face of the Church at
Trid^t: I would that with one consent they had not altogether declined from
religion unto superstition, from faith unto infidelity, from Christ unto
Antichrist, from God unto Epicu^us. This notwithstanding the Papists do
continue in an erroneous opinion that Councels cannot err.



The Antithesis in this and the other part of the subscription, will easily
make apparent what by this proposition is set-downe.

4 General Councels we simply condemn not; yet do we not ground our faith
upon any Council, but only upon the word of god. Therefore in general
Councels
VVhat-soeuer is agreeable to the written word of god, we do reuerendlie
embrace. VVhat-soeuer is contrary unto, or besides the vvil of God reueiled in
his word, we do carefully avoid. And So are we commanded to do even by
God himself. Deuteronomy. 12. 32* John. 1. 7. Ezekiel. 20. v. 18. 19. Gal. 1. 8.
Thus think the godly churches reformed. Confess. of Heluet. 2. c. 18. Bohem.
cap. 1. France art. 5. Flan. art. 7. VVittem. c. 33. Contrary here unto
the opinion of the Papists concerning councils is, that
Theie do bind al nations. So did Pope Hormisda decree. Some councils, and
namely the Council of Nice. Constantinople. Ephesus. Chalcedon. So thought
Pope Gregory the great
Al Councels, so did Campion suppose. were of aequal authority with the word
of God.



22. ARTICLE. Of Purgatory.
THe Romish doctrine concerning 1. 2 Purgatory, 3 Pardons, worshipping, and
adoration 4 as well of images, 5 as of relics, 6 and also invocation of
Saints, is a fond thing, vainelie invented, and grounded upon no warrantie of
Scripture, but rather repugnant to the word of God.

The Propositions.
The Romish doctrine touching 1 Purgatory, 2 Purgatory, 3 Pardons, 4
Worshipping and adoration of Images, 5 Worshipping and adoration of Relics, 6
Invocation of Saints,
Is a thing Not warranted by the Scripture. Contrary to the word of God.

1 It is granted as well of the Romish, or false, as of the true Church, that
none unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of God. And because al me^
either have bine, or still remain unclean, therefore theie are or must be
purged from sin. But in the manner of purging them who are vnpure, they do
greatly differ. For the true church looking into the word of God, does
find that we are sanctified, or made clean in diverse respects diversely.
By Baptism. Ephesians. 5. v. 25. 26. By the word preached. John. 15. 3. By the
blood of Christ* ^. Ioh 1. 7. Tit. 2. 14. Heb. 1. 3. By the spirit of God. 1.
Cor. 6. 11. And that in this life, and not in the other world. For in the
Scripture there is mention but only
Of two ways. Mat 7. 13. 14. One leading unto destruction One bringing unto
life.

11 Therefore the Romish doctrine touching purgatory established by the late
conuenticle at Trent. ( Decret. de Purgat. ses. 25. and ses. 6. c^n. 30.)
cannot be warranted by the holy Scripture.




2 The Papists sliding back from the truth of God, have fallen in to many
noisome, and diverse opinions in the matter of Purgatory, agreeing among
themselves neither
About the place where Purgatory should be, some placing the same In the
bottom of the sea. Near unto the mount Hecla in Ireland. Upon the mount A^tna
in Sicil. In Hell.
About the tormentors in Purgatory, who by some are thought to be Holy
Angels. Very devils.
About the torments. For some dream how theie are tormented With fire only.
With water, and with fire.
About the causes of Purgatory torments. Because many do think For which in
this life men have done no penance, are there punished.
Only venial sins. Venial, and deadly sins.
About the time which theie that are tormented, shall abide in Purgatory. For
some have giuen-out that the poor souls there Be continualie in torments.
Have rest sometime, as upon Sondaies. Holy days.
In time shall be set at liberty, because their punishment is but temporary.
May be delivered at any time if Their friends with money will buie-out their
pains. The Priests will pray for them. The Pope will but say the word.

About the state of the souls in Purgatotie. For Our English Papists at Rhemes
do think those in Purgatory to be in a more happy and blessed state than
any that do live in this world. Some, as Thomas Aquinas, say the pain of hell
fire, and the pain of the fire of Purgatory are al one, and that theie differ
nothing but that the one is but temporal, and the other not so. And others, put
in choice either to tar^ie in Purgatory a day, or to suffer the miseries of
this world an 100* years, have chosen th'affliction of this life, for an
hundred years together, than the pains of Purgatory for one winters day.
Therefore in this contrariety of opinions, some of them th'aduersaries
themselves cannot deny, must be, we say al of them are, contrary to the
word of God. Besides they nourish most cursed, and damnable errors, as that
All the souls of the faithful, separated from their bodies, are not at rest.
These are purged in purgatory*
Al sins in their own nature, are not mortal, or deadly. Some sins
deserve not everlasting punishment.
One sinful man may save another, and that easily by Some thing for them
Praieng, Saying, Doing,
If friends in this world will do nothing for poor souls in pain, yet may
they come unto life at length by abiding their deserved torments until the end
in purgatory. The Pope is God in that he can at his pleasure deliver From the
guil^ of sin. From the punishments due to sin.



3 Such has bine th'exceeding mercy and love of God toward man, that as he
has purged us from all guiltines of sin by the blood: So has he pardoned us
from th'euer lasting punishment due to sin by the pains of Christ. For
There is salvation in none other. For among men there is given none other name
under heaven whereby we must be saved. Act. 4. 12. Through his Name all that
believe shall receive remiscion of sins. Act 10. 43. He has purchased the
Church by his own blood. Act. 20. 28. With his stripes we are healed. Isa.
53. 5. He that believes in him shall not Be condemned, John. 3. 18 Be ashamed.
Romans 10. 11. Therefore
Come unto me, al ye that are weary, and laden, and I will case you, etc. And
ye shall find rest for your souls, says our Savior Christ. Mar 11. v. 28.
29. If thou shall confesce with thie mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe
in thine heart that God raised him up from the dead, thou shall be saved,
says S. Paul. Romans 10. 9. This being the doctrine of god himself, and of
his Church, (See art. 2. proposit. 4. art. 11. proposit. 1. art. 22. proposit
1.) we may evidently perceive how not only vain; but besides, not only
besides, but against the word of god the Romish doctrine concerning Pardons is.
For that does teach us
To seek salvation not at God alone, but at the hands of sinful man. For
would we have pardon That we may be our own Sauiors: So did that of
purgatory. For the sins of 40. days? A Bishop may give it. For the sins
of an 100* days? A Cardinal may grant it. For all our sins committed or to
be committed? From the Pope we may have it. Here are his pardons if you
respect Time for years. 40 50 100 1000 1000 10000
Offenses. For Parricide. Homicide Treason. The sin of Sodom Perjury, etc.

How the precious blood of Christ was shed in vain. For corruptible gold
and silver may and will save us. That repentance is not of necessity to the
salvation of man. For without the same a popish pardon may save; but without
either a pardon from the Pope, or absolution of a Priest, there is no salvation.

5 Of all the erroneous opinions among the papists which are infinite, none is
more to the illusio^ of well meaning christians than their doctrine concerning
worshipping, and adoration of the Relics of Saints. A doctrine,
In the Scripture, No where to be found Forbidden Deuteronomy. 6, 13* Matthew. 4, 10.
In the purer time of the Church no where to be heard. In all reformed Churches
at this time utterly condemned, as in part by some testimonies extant,
evidently may appear. Confess. of Hell. 2, c. 5. Hell. 1. art. 11. Basil. ar.
10. Bohem. c. 17. Franc. ar. 24. Yet such is the Satanical boldness of that
Antichristian Synagogue, that as theie will delude men with the relics of
Saints, which are not so: So likewise theie teach the people, which is most
abominable, to give divine adoration and honor unto them. Hence
Says one, and that in ^ general Council. In like ^ort do I worship, and
honor, and salute the R^^ques also of Saints, as of the champions and fighters
for Christ; and as of them who have obtained favor from God both to minister
remedy, to heal diseases, to cast-out devils, etc. Some do pray unto S.
Benedict, whose relics theie had stolen. O Benedict after God our only hope,
leave us not orphans, who art come hither not through our merits, but for the
salvation of many souls. Have some published, That the bodies of Saints, and
specialie the Relics of the blessed Martyrs, are with all synceritie to be
honored as the members of Christ, etc. If any deny this sentence, he is to
be thought not a Christian, but an Eunomian, and Vigilautian. The Council of
Trent has decreed, that theie are to be taken for damned, which affirm how
worship and honor is not to be given unto the Relics of Saints, etc. Of this
preposterous devotion
Theie have appointed a certain Service for the holy Crosce, where-on Christ
was hanged. Theie have made a feast for the Spear and Nails wherewith Christ
was launced. Theie have canonized for a Saint, the Chains which bound the
Apustle Saint Peter. To say nothing of the adoration theie give
To the Hair, Milk, Smock of the B. virgin. To the Head, Hair, Thombe, Coat
of John Baptist. To the Breaches of Joseph. To the Sword, Hand-kirchiefe of S.
Paul. To the Keys of S. Peter. To many things which of modesty I will not
mention, but ouerpasse.




6 The Christian exercise of prayer is a duty which may not be securely
omitted, or vainlie abused. And though many things in prayer be necessarily
to be observed: yet a special point is that in our supplications and prayers we
call only upon God. For so to do we are
Commanded even of God himself. Psalm. 50, 15. Matthew 6, 9. Luke: 11, 2. Allured
by manifold Promises of large blessings. Psalm. 50, 15. Matthew 7, 11. Luke. 11,

and al his Epist. Peter. etc. Acts 1, 24.
All the elect in this world. Luke 18, 7. On the other side to pray unto any
creature that dead is, beside Jesus Christ.
In the Scripture there is no Law to command To provoke.
Promise of blessing Example of godly men, or women

As the church of God in the pure^ times have: so in these days the Protestant
Churches utterly mislike. See Confess. of Heluet. 1. art. ^1. Heluet. 2 c. 5,
23. Basil. art. 10. Bohem. c. 2. 17. France. art. 14. 24. Fland. art. 20.

eyes. S. Damian for physic. S. Erasmus, for health in th'intrals S. Feriol,

23. ARTICLE. Of Ministering in the Congregation.
IT is not lawful 1 for any man to take upon him the office of public
preaching, 3 or ministering the Sacraments in the Congregation, 2 before he be
lawfully called, and sent t'execute the same. 4 And those we ought to judge
lawfully called, and sent: which be 6 chosen and called to this work 5 by men
who have public authority given unto them in the congregation, to call and
send Ministers into the Lords vineyard.

The Propositions.
1 None publicly may preach, but such as are auctorized thereunto. 2 Theie
must not be silent, who by office are bound to preach. 3 The Sacraments may
not be administered in the Congregation but by a lawful Minister. 4 There is a
lawful Ministry in the Church. 5 Theie are lawful Ministers which be ordained
by Men lawfully appointed to the calling* and sending-forth of Ministers. 6
Before Ministers are to be ordained, theie are to be chosen, and called.
1 Many are the duties enioined to every christian: yet so is it ordained by
the wisdom of God, that none should as govern in the Co^mon-weale: so teach
publicly in the Church, but such as lawfully be called and sent to execute
the same. This
By the Scripture is apparent where The godly are commanded to preach, before
theie would speak: so was The wiked are blamed for preaching before theie were
sent. Iere. 14, 14. 23, 21. 27, 15. 29 9. Samuel. 1. Sam. 3, 4, etc. Jeremy.

To all such as to their power do seek th'abolishing of public preaching, as
do subtle Papists, and worldly men. To al such as publishe how the word is

of the Spirit, so did Muncer. To al such as run before theie be sent, as do
many Anabaptists. Schismatikes, to carry disciples after them

may, and must so do, and that not priuatlie, but publicly, though theie be
not ordinarily called, and sent thereunto. The doctrine of R. H.


2 As publicly to preach before men are sent, is a gre^uous fault: so not to
preach being sent, is as great a sin. Hereunto ^eare witness
In the Scripture Jesus Christ whose words are these, Surely I must also
preach the kingdom of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent. Luke. 4.
43. Peter and John, who being charged to speak no more in the name of Jesus,
said, We cannot but speak that which we have heard, and seen. Act. 4. 17.
etc. S. Paul. For he writes, Necessity is laid upon me, and woe is unto me, if
I preach not the Gospel. For if I do it willingly, I have a reward: but if I
do it against my will, yet the dispensation is committed unto me. 1. Cor. 9. v.
16, 17. The Apostles. For though theie were beaten for so doing: yet ceased
theie not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. Act. 5. 42.

Ignorance, that theie can not VVorldly business that they may not Negligence

God.


3. To minister the Sacraments in the Congregation every man may not presume;
but theie are so to do as be lawfully called, and sent for that purpose (Heb.
5, 4.) as they be whose office publicly is to teach and instruct the people
of God. For so we may read
In the Scripture that the preachers of the word, are to be the ministers of
the Sacraments. For both Christ by his authority did command his disciples, as
to preach* so to Baptize. Matthew. 28, 19. Celebrate the Lord his supper Luke.
22, 19. 1. Cor. 11, ^. 24, 25.

The Apostles and other ministers in the purest times, whom the godly
ministers in these d^ies do succeed, did not ^nclie preach but also Baptize,

13. In saying that none may minister the Sacraments in the Congregation before
he be lawfully called, and sent to execute the same, the meaning is not, as I
take it, that privately in houses either lawful ministers, upon just
occasio(...) (...)aie not, or others, not of the ministry, upon any occasion,
in the peace of the Church, may administer the Sacraments. For though it be
lawful for almen in their places to teach, to exhort, to reprehend, to pray,
and that continually, and in all places: yet may none minister the Sacraments
but such as are publicly auctorized so to do. The contrary where of neither
by any commandment from God, no^ example in The Apostles time can be shown.
Hereby we declare our selves not to favor the opinion that
Publicly some may minister the Sacraments which are not meerlie, and full
ministers of the word. Sacraments.
Privately the Sacrament of baptism may be ministered by any man, yea by
women, if necessity ^o urge.


4 God for the gathering, or erecting to himself a Church out of mankind, and
for the wel-gouerning of the same, has from time to time used* yea, does also,
and to the end of the world will use the ministry of men lawfully called
thereunto by men. A truth most evident

5 S. Paul in the beginning of his Epistle unto the Galathians, gives us to
observe the diverse sendingforth of men into the holy Ministry: whereof some
are sent

calling is special, and extraordinary. And they so called were
Adorned with the gift of miracles, as were I. Christ, and his Apostles, but not
John Baptist. Inioined to preach not in one or a fevve places, but over the
whole world: so were the apostles, but not Jesus Christ.


2 Of men, as they be who are sent, of men not auctorized thereunto* by the
word of God, and that to the disquieting of the good estate of Christ his
Church, such In The Apostles time were the false Apostles, In our days are the
S. Augustine says Al which are thus sent are Liars. And their calling is
unlawful.
Annabaptistes Jesuits. Seminary priests.

3 By men: so in the primi^lue Church by The Apostles, were Pastors and Elders
ordained, who by the same authority ordained other Pastors and teachers.
Whence it is that the Church as it has bine: so it shall ^^l the end of the
world ^e provided for. They who are thus called, have power neither to
work miracles, as The Apostles had; no^ to preach and minister the Sacraments
where theie vvil, as The Apostles might: but the^e are tied every man to his
charge, which the^e must faithfully attend upon, except urgent occasion do
enforce the contrary. The calling of these men is termed a general calling,
and it is th'ordinarie, and in these days the lawful calling allowed by the
word of God. So ^e^^fie with us the true Churches elsewhere in the world.

This truth many ways has bine resisted. For there be which think
There is no calling, but th'extraordinarie, and special calling in these
days. Al are to be taken for which are not sacrificing Priests, anointed by
the Antichristian Bishops of the Romish lynagogue
Wolves. Hie^lings. Lai-men. Intruders.
That so many as are sent by the Church are sent of the holy Ghost: when we
know how often times the CHVRCHE sends for Laborers* idle workmen
Friends, enemies. Physicians, murderers. True Pastors* wolves and Apostataes.
Theie may take the charge of Congregations, and yet perform no duty. That
no Bishop, or Minister should remain still in one place, but wander. An error
of the Family.


6 Though it be in the power of them which have public authority in the
Church t'appoint Ministers in the Congregation: yet may theie admit neither
whom they will nor as they will themselves; but they are both deliberatelie to
choose, and orderly to call such as theie have chosen

24. ARTICLE. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people
understand not.
IT is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God, and the custom of the
primitive church, to have public prayer in the church, or to minister the
Sacraments in a tongue not understood of the people.

Public prayer, and the Sacraments must be ministered in a known tongue.

But there is nothing so apparent which has not by some adversaries bine

Some, as the Marcosians, at the ministration of Baptism, have used certain
Hebrew words not to aedifie, but to terifie, and astonishe the minds of the
weak and ignorant people. Some, and theie be the papists, will have al service,
prayers and Sacraments, and that throughout the world, ministered in an unknown
tongue. And among these papists, There be which hold that the less theie
understand, the more devout the people will be. For ignorance is the mother of
devotion. There be which write, that prayers not understood of the people, are
acceptable (of Satan I grant, but not of God) such are the Rhemists.




25. ARTICLE. Of the Sacraments.
Sacraments ordained of Christ1 be not only badges, or tokens of christian
men's profession, but rather theie be2 certain sure witnesses, and effectual
signs of grace, and Gods good-wil toward us, by which he does work
invisibly in us,3 and not only quicken, but also strengthen, and confirm our
faith in him.

4There be two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that
is to say, Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord. Those five commonly called
Sacraments, that is to say,5 Confirmation,6 Penance,7 Orders,8 Matrimony,9
and extreme-Unction, are not to be coupled for Sacraments of the Gospel, being
such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of The Apostles, partly
are states of life allowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not like nature of
Sacraments with Baptism, and the Lords Supper, for that theie have not any
visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.

10 The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be
carried-about, but that we should duly use them.11 And in such only, as
worthelie receive the same, theie have a wholesome effect, or operation: but
theie that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as
Saint Paul says.

The Propositions.
1 The Sacraments ordained of Christ, be badges, or tokens of our profession
which be Christians. 2 The Sacraments be certain sure witnesces, and
effectual signs of grace, and God his goodwil toward us. 3 By the Sacraments
God does not only quicken, but also strengthen, and confirm our faith in him.
4 Christ has ordained but two Sacraments in his holy Gospel. 5 Confirmation,
Is no Sacrament. 6 Penance, Is no Sacrament. 7 Orders, Is no Sacrament. 8
Matrimony. Is no Sacrament. 9 Extreme Unction, Is no Sacrament. 10 The
Sacraments are not to be abused, but rightly to bevsed of us al. 11 Al which
receive the Sacraments, receive not there-withal the things signified by the
Sacrament.
1 The Sacraments be not mere and only tokens of a Christian profession, as
shall appear: yet are the Sacraments badges or tokens
Of Christians. For by them are visiblie discerned The faithful from infidels.

The true servants of God, from enemies to the truth. See a^. 19. proposit. 5.
where it is declared how the true Church is known by the due administration
Of the word preached. Of the Sacraments.
Of Christianity. For As Circumcision in the old law, was a token how all the
corrupt, and carnal affections of the mind should be subdued; and that the Lord
required not so much an outward of the body, as an inward circumcision of
the heart (Deuteronomy. 10, 16. 30, 6. Iere. 4, 4. Acts. 7, 51. Romans 12, 28. Phil. 3,
3. Col. 2, 11) so Baptism ^elleth us, that being once dead unto sin, we are
to live unto righteousness; that al we which have bine, baptized into Jesus
Christ, have bine baptized into his death, etc. and must walk in newness of
life etc. (Romans 6, 3. etc.) for we have put on Christ, (Gal. 3, 26.) by
baptism. As the Paschal Lamb was to the Jews a token that the flight of
sin should always be fresh in memory, and that it should be celebrated not
with old leaven, neither in the leaven of maliciousness, but with the
unleavened bread of synceritie and truth, (1. Cor. 5, 8:) So the participating
of one loaf, and of one cup in the Lord his Supper* does commend unto our
consideration a sweet concord, a brotherly unanimity, and a constant
continuance in the true worship, and service of God, without ^a^ouring
idolatry in any ^espect (1. Cor. 10, 17, etc.) This do the godly learned
every where teach, etc Some reformed Churches by pub. Conses. do testify

That theie which are partakets of the Sacraments, are undoubtedly saved. That
so many as are not incorporated into the visible Church by the Sacraments, at
the least of Baptism, are assuredly condemned.




3 The Sacraments be not meerlie tokens either of our duty toward God and
man; or of God his good will to usward: but besides by them he does
Quicken. Stre^gthen. Confirm. Our faith in him So we may read
In the Scripture. Acts. 2, 38. etc. 1. Cor. 6, 11. Ephesians. 5, 26. 1. Cor. 10,

tied unto the visible signs and Sacraments. For
Without the Sacraments many have lived, and died, who yet pleased God, and
are no doubt saved, either in respect Of their faith; so are we to think of a^
the godly Men Which were borne, and died before th'institution of
Circumcision. Which were borne, and died in the wilderness. Which were
borne, and died in the time of Grace, and yet by some extremity could not
receive the seal of the covenant.
VVome^, who before and under the law for many years were partakers of no
Sacrament, and never of one Sacrament.
That they be heirs of the promise
Some have faith before theie receive any of the Sacraments* So Had Abraham.
Romans 4. v. 9, 10. The Jews unto whom Peter preached. Act. 2, 4^. The
Samaritans. Act 8, 12 Th'eunuch. Acts. 8, 37. Cornelius the Centurion with his
company. Acts. 10, 47.
Have the godie of discretion not yet baptized.
Some neither before, not at the instant, nor yet afterward, though daily theie
should receive the Sacraments, will have a true faith, such are like unto Judas
John. 13, 26. Ananias, and Sapphira. Acts. 5. Simon Magus. Act. 8. 13. The Old
Israelites. 1. Cor. 10. 5. The wiked Corinthians. 1. Cor. 11* 27. etc.
In some the Sacraments do effectualie work in process of time, by the help
of the word preached, which engendereth faith (Romans 10, 14.) Such is the state
principalie of infants elected unto life, and salvation. Greatliie therefore do
theie err, who teach or hold, that
They are damned, which dies without the seals of the covenant, albe it
theie have the promise of aeternal li^e, whereupon theie build. An error of the
Papists. The Sacraments ex opere operato, bring faith. So teach the Papists.
Infants have faith; or that faith can be where no knoledge of Jesus Christ is;
or that any can have such knoledge without the preaching of the word. The
Sacraments are not ordinary means to raise up good motionsin the hearts of the
faithful, but only mere and outward signs of spiritual things.




4 A Sacrament.
According to th'etymologie of the word, as the Schoolmen do write, is a
sign of an holy thing, which being true, then have here bine, and still are,
by so many above either two, or seven Sacraments, as there be, and have bine
above two or seven things, which are signs of sacred and holy things.
According to the nature of a Sacrament indeed, is a covenant of God his favor
to manward, confirmed by some outward sign, which also has bin sometime
Special to some Men, and that extraordinarily by things Natural, as the Tree
of life to Adam. Genesis 3. 3. Rainbow, to Noah. Genesis 9. 9, etc.
Supernatural, as the Smoking furnace, to Abram. Gene. 15. 17. Fleece of wool,
to Gedeon. Iud. 6, 37. Dial to Ezekiah. 2. King. 20, 11. Isa. 38. 8.

Nations, as were To the Jews.
The Sacrifices. Circumcision. The Paschal lamb.

General to the whole church militant, perpetual, and ordinary, as in the time
of the Gospel. And then is a Sacrament defined to be a Ceremony ordained
immediately by Christ himself, who by some earthly, and outward element does
promise everlasting favor and felicity to al such, as with true faith and
repentance do receive the same. Such in the new Test. we find only to be
Baptism, mentioned Matt. 2^, 19. Mat. 16, 16. John. 3, 5. Act. 2, 38.
The Lords supper, as Luke. 22, 19. John. 6, 53. 1. Cor. 11, 24. This is the
judgment al so of the Churches Protestant. Confess.

diverse, and namely
For theie deny all the Sacraments of the Church, as we hold them. The Turks.
The Jews.
The Euchytes, who say the Sacraments are not profitable, and to be used, but
only prayer. The Schuenk-feldians, which contemn not only the word
preached, but the Sacraments besides as superfluous, depending upon
Revelations. The Bannisterians, who think there vvil be a time, and that in
this world too, when we shall need no Sacraments. The Papists, who publish
As Hovvlet does, that we leave ou^ no less than six of the seven Sacraments.
How there be seven Sacraments of the nevve Testament. That he is accursed that
shall say there be either mo, or less than seven Sacraments; or that any of
them is not verelie, and properly a Sacrament; or that theie be not all seven
instituted of Christ himself.






5 Touching Confirmation the sentence and judgment
Of the Church of God is That rightly used, as it was in the primitive Church,
it is no sacrament, but a part of Christian discipline profitable for the whole
Church of God. For the ancient Confirmation was nothing else, than an examination
of such, as in their infancy had received the Sacrament of Baptism, and were
then, being of good discretion, able to yield an account of their belief, and
to testify with their own mouths that which their suerties in their names
had promised at their Baptism. Which confession being made, and a promise of
perseverance in the Faith by them given, the Bishop by sound doctrine, grave
advice, and godly exhortation, confirmed them in that good profession; and
laieng his hands upon them, prayed for the increase of God his gifts, and graces
in their minds. That Popish Confirmation is no Sacrament of the Church of
Christ: and this is apparent, as in the former proposition of this 25 art: so
besides Confession of Heluet. 2. c. 19. Saxon. art. 19. VVittem. c. 11.

Of th'antichristia^ synagog is* that Confirmation is a Sacrament, whereby the
grace that was given in Baptism is confirmed, and made strong by the 7. gifts
of the holy Ghost. Of which their Confirmation theie give us to observe four
things The substance, or matter; which is holy Chrisme co^fect, as theie say,
and made of Consecrated by a Bishop.
Oil olive Baulme.
The form and manner of ministering the same; consisting of The words of the
Bishop, which are, I sign thee with the sign of the Cross, and confirm
thee with the Chrisme of salvation, in the name of the Father, of the Son,
and of the holy Ghost Actions Of a Godfather, or Godmother that is confirmed,
holding up the child to the Bishop. Of the Bishop Crossing him, that is to be
confirmed on the forehead with oil. Striking the party confirmed on the ear.


The minister, who must be a Bishop, and none inferior. The Effect, or affects
rather. Theie say by Confirmation Sins are pardoned, and remitted. The grace
of baptism is made perfect. Such become men in Christ, who before were but
children. Grace is given boldly to confess the name of Christ, and al things
belonging to a Christian man. The holy Ghost is given to the full. Perfect
strength of the mind is attained. This lays open to the view of the world
the most dangerous, and damnable errors of the Church of Rome concerning
Confirmation. For
It is an error to say that Confirmation is a Sacrament, because it has none
institution from God, which is necessary to al, and every Sacrament,
inasmuch as a Sacrament can be ordained of none but of God himself, even as
th'aduersaries them selves do confess. Catech. Trid. tit. de Confir. To say
that Popish Confirmation is grounded upon the word of god, is to speak soul
errors, and untruths. For in all the holy Scripture there is no mention It is
an error to say there is any other ointme^t given to the strengthening of the
church militant besides the holy Ghost. 1. John. 2, 27 Of the matter that it
must be Chrisme, and that made of Olive oil, and Baulme, and consecrated of a
Bishop. Of the form, that either the Bishop must sign him that is to be
confirme^ with the sign of the Cross; or that any Godfather, etc, should be
the at. etc. Of the minister, that (...) must be a Bishop, tha^^ to confirm.
Of the effects, that therebie Sins are pardoned, (...) ^emised. The grace

It is an error to think that any (...) can give heavenly graces to any (...)
It is an error t'ascribe salvation to (...) and not only to Christ. It

thinesse of the Ministers. It is an error, that men cannot be (...)fect
Christians without Popish C^^mation. It is an error that by Confirmation holy
Ghost is given to the full.



^ The Sacrament of Repentance, which is baptism, (Luke 3, 3.) we allow: but
that Popish poenance is a Sacrament we altogether deny. As of Confirmation, so
of Poena^^e, th'aduersaries do publish four things to be noted, and none of
the^ truly grounded upon the word of God
First the matter, which of the Papists some do say is Th'actio^s of the
poenitent person, that is to say Th'absolution by the Priest Sufficient
contrition of heart. Perfect Confession. Of al sins, and that in particular.
Of al circumstances, as of place, time, etc
Satisfactions in works; which makes a full amends for all offenses.

Secondly the form, which In the Priest is the words of absolutio^, which the
priest utters over the sinner. In the person poenitent is His kneeling down
at the priests feet His making the sign of the cross upon his breast. His
saying benedicite to his ghost lie father. The priest bears the person of
God, and is the lavvful judge over the poenitent and may
Absolve from the gilt of sin. Inflict a punishment, according to the offense.


Thirdly, the Minister, who Ordinarily is the Curat of every parish.
Extraordinarily, and in the time of extreme necessity, or by license, any
Priest Yet some sins are so grecuous that non may absolve them, but
The Pope, o^ his Legate as Burning of Churches, Violent striking of a Priest.
Cou^ter fe^ting the pops Bulls. The bishop or his poenitentiarie, as Incest.
Breaking of vows. Robbers of churchs Haeretikes. Adulterers, etc.

Fourthlie, th'affect. Hereby they say a poenitent sinner is From al sin, as
when he was newly baptized.
Purged Absolved. Made clean
Enriched with spiritual gifts and graces. The consideration here of has
moved the churches reformed to condemn this Antichristan Sacrament of
paenance, as having no vvarrant from the word of God. Confess. of
Heluet. 2. c. 14. 19. Behem. cap. 4. Ausburg. art. 3. 11. 12. Saxon. ar. 16.
17. VVittem. art. 13. 14. 15. Sueaue. cap. 20. The blasphemies are outrageous,
and th'error many, and monstrous comprised in this doc trine of popish
poenance. For
Whereas they say, the Sacrament of poenance was instituted by christ
himself, it is most false. For, as they teach it, neither the matter, no^ the
form, no^ the Priest, no^ the effect thereof can be drawn from the word of
God. They say Poenance is a Sacrament, yet can they show no element it has to
make it a Scacrament. Popish Contrition is against the truth. For none is
sufficiently contrite for his sins. To confess al sins, and that one after
another, with all circumstances, unto a priest, as it is impossible, so is it
erroneous, and never enioined by God, nor practiced by any of God his Saints,
that we can find in the holy Scripture. That any man can satisfy for his
sins it is blasphemous, and against the merits of Christ, yet do the Papists
teach it; and besides, that one man may satisfy for another. An untruth is
it, that any priest Bishop, or Pope, has power to forgive sins, or can
enioine anic punishment that can make an amends to God for the least offense.
If Poenance purge men, and make them clean from al sin, then is there a time
when me^ in this life be perfect, which tends greatly to th'error of the
Catharans, Donatists, and Pelagians. That Baptism is a token that original
sin only, and not actual sins besides, which the elect servants of God shall
commit, are pardoned, it is against the word of God. The doctrine that they
which willingly depart out of this world vvith-out shrife, are damned,
which thing the Papists do hold, is a damnable doctrine, and to be eschevveda.


^ The church of England and of other places reformed. do acknoledge an order
of making mi^^^ers in the Church of God, where al things are to be done by
order. But, that order is a Sacrament, none but disordered Papists will grant:
and yet they observe none order in speaking of the ^ame. For among them
Some do make 7. orders, whereof some be Inferior, as the order of Porters,
whose office is To keep the door. T'expel the wiked. To let-in the faithful.
2 Exorcists, or Coniurers, which have power t'expel devils. 3 Lectors or
Readers, who are to read lessons and scripture in the Church. 4 Acolytes, or
Candle-bearers, having authority To bear cruets to the altar with wine and
water. To bear candles and tapers.

Superior, as the order of 5 Subdeacons; who are To read Th'epistle. To prepare
necessaries for ministration. T'assist the Priest in ministration.
6 Deacons; their duty is To read the Gospel. T'assist the Priest in
ministration.
7 Priests to whom authority is given to minister Sacraments, that is to say
Baptism. Poenance. The Sacrament of Th'alter, and to sacrifice for the quick
and the dead. Annealing of the sick. Matrimony. These 7 Orders say some of
the Papists
Are 7. Sacraments, as Lombardus; and so there be 13. Sacraments. Make but one
Sacrament. Were not only instituted, but entered-into by Christ himself.



Some numbering the seven Sacraments, do quite ouerpasse in silence the
Sacrament of Order, and in place thereof mention the Sacrament of Priesthood.
Alwhich things are both besides, and also contrary to the word of god. For in
the Scripture
Where can it be showen that either Orders, as some, ca^ make either one or
7. Sacraments; or Priesthood, as others think, is a Sacrament? what element
has it? what form? what promise? what institution from Christ* Where can
any of those hideous titles of Porter, Exorcists, etc. be found ascribed to
any minister of the new Testament? or the manner of creating, or their offices
established? Some papists do write that al th'inferior Orders are not grounded
upon scripture, but come by tradition (Clypeus Milit. Ec. l. 1. c. 9; and Lomb.
says plainly, that five of the 7. Orders neither can be read in the word of
God, nor yet were heard of in the primitive Church. lib. 4. did. 24. Where
may it be found that the office of a Deacon is to read the Gospel? Where is
the minister of the word and Sacraments of the new Testament called priest, in
the popish sense? Where is it appointed to the ministers of the new Testament
only to minister the Sacraments? or to minister mo than two, baptism, and the
L. Supper? Or if there be mo than two, as there be not, by what Scripture may
they not minister al of them, but must only minister Sacraments, that is,
certain Sacraments? By what one place have priests authority to offer
sacrifice, and that for the quick, and dead also? Where without extreme
sacrilege, can theie show that our S. Christ was a Porter, an Exorcist etc.
and not always a King* a Prophet, and a Priest?

8 Marriage is a state of life holy, and honorable among al men, (Heb 1^. 4)
and ^o forbid the same, s^uoureth of an e^^on^ous spirit, and is the doctrine
of devils (1. Tim. 4 1. etc.) Howbeit to say that Marriage is a Sacrament
instituted. and that by christ as the papists do, we cannot be induced, and
that for sundry reasons of importance. For Marriage, o^ the wedded state
Was never commanded to be taken for a Sacrament. As a Sacrament should, and
Baptism, and the L Supper have.
Has none outward element, Has no prescribed form, Has no promise of
salvation, or damnation,
May be entered into or not, at our discretion: but it is not at our chois to
be pertakers, or not to participate of the Sacraments, i^ we may come by
them. Marriage was ordained by God himself in paradise: but the Sacraments of
the new Tes. were instituted by christ in the time of the Gospel. It was no
Sacrament to the Fathers before, and in the time of the Law, and therefore no
Sacrament unto us. Hereunto in effect subscribe the Churches of god elsewhere

when theie will have it to be a Sacrament. Certain Vigilantian Bishopps* that
would take none into the Clergy, except they would be Married first.
Some have too baselie and wikedly thought of Marriage. And therefore some do
hold that it is not meet* That any man or woman should marry, such were The
Gnostikes. The Mar^ionites. The Tatians. The Montanists. The Manichies. The
Hieracites. Th'aposto likes.
That any should twice marry the husband or wise being dead, as, The
Catharans. Origin. Tertulian.
That some should marry at al. and namely, Such are the papists
Such as have taken Orders. Spiritual kinsfolks. Kinsfolks with in many
degrees. That man who is lawfully divorced from an adulteress.




9 The Papists furthermore take Annoiling of the sick which theie call E^treme
unction, for a Sacrament. Whereof, as theie write
The matter is only hallowed by a Bishop, vvherevvith the sick is annoiled
upon th'eies, ears, mouth, nose, hands and feet. The form is the words
which the priest speaks when he does anoin^ the sick in the foresaid places:
as By this holy oil, God forgive thee thy sins, which thou have committed
by thine eyes, nose, ears, and mouth, by thine hands, and by thy feet. All
the teach thee.
Angels. Archangels Patriarch^ Prophets Apostles Evangelists Martyrs Confessors
Virgins Widow and Infants

The Minister Is the Priest, as some Papists do think, who is To hear
Confession. To give Absolution. To minister the Sacrament of The Altar. To
annoile.
If any Christian, as Papists in chiefest place do permit.
The Effect is to purge and put-awaie Venial sins committed by mispending of
our senses. Sins forgotten. In this Antichristian doctrine many errors do
concur. For (to omit in silence how nothing which the Papists deliver
concerning extreme unction can be found in the hohe Scriptures, as neither the
matter nor the manner, nor the Minister, nor any institution at al from Christ;
nor any commandment that either al which are sick, or in all ages to the
worlds end, some sick persons should be annoiled)
In respect of the matter, the Papists make of a gross element, a spiritual
ointment, whereas there is none ointment spiritual, but the holy Ghost. In
respect of the form The only propitiator, and Mediator between God and man
Christ Jesus is blasph^med, and the merit and power of his death ascribed to
greasy oil. Christ is not acknoledged for the only Savior of mankind, and
physician of our souls, but other physicians be received besides him.
In respect of the Minister It appears that man has power to forgive sins,
which belongs unto God alone. Other men, yea women, besides the ordinary
Ministers of the word* may be ministers of the Sacraments.
In respect of the effect we may gather, that Al sins be not mortal. Christ
has not cleansed such as be his from al their sins, by his precious blood.



10 In the word of God the right use of the Sacraments and th'ends of their
institution, are evidently set down. For concerning
Baptism, Christ he says Teach al nations, baptizing them, etc. Mat. 28, 29.
He that shall believe, and be baptized, shall be saved. Man. 16, 16.
The Lord his Supper says Our Savior. Man. 26, v. 26, 27. Of the bread, Take,
eat, etc. Of the cup, Drink ye al of it.
S. Paul. 1. Cor. 10, 16. The cup of blessing, which we bless, is it not the
communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the
communion of the body of Christ? This truth do the Churches reformed by
public Confession subscribe unto. Confess.

The living are to be baptized for the dead as the Marcionites.

Of the Lords Supper par tlie By thrusting it into the mouths of dead men, as
did some condemned long ago by a Council at Carthage. Such are the Papists.
By strawing the Sacrament upon graves and tombs. By using it magicallie, as a
salve against bodily sickness, adue^sitie, etc. By carieng it about
pompouslie, and supersticiouslie to be adored of the beholders, like an Idol.






11 True it is that every one which receaueth the Sacraments, receives not
therewithal the things signified by the Sacraments, that is, Forgiving of
sins, or other spiritual graces freely for Christ his sake. For we do find
that
Some do receive the Sacraments, and the things signified by the Sacraments. So
did Cornelius receive the Sacrament of Baptism. Acts. 10, 47. The Lords Supper.
The good disciples. The godly Corinthians.

Some receive the Sacraments, but not the things signified by the Sacraments So
received Simon Magus baptism. Acts. 8, 13. Judas the L. Supper. John* 13. 26.
So receive the 1. Cor. 11, 27. etc.
Atheists. Libertines. Impenitent persons.

Some receive not the Sacraments, and yet are partakers of the thing signified
by the Sacraments Such a communicant was the thief upon the Cross Luke. 23*
v. 43. 44, This makes us to conceive well Of those men and women which
would and cannot communicate with the godly. Of the children of Christian
parents which die before theie be baptized. Furthermore it is appatent, how
Salvation is promised to the^ which are baptized, yet not simply, but if
theie do believe. Mar. ^6, 16. Whosoever shall eat the bread, or drink the cup
of the Lord vnvvorthilie, shall be guilty of the body and blood of Christ. 1.
Cor. 11, 27 The same do the god lie Churches in their Co^fes testify unto the
world. Confess.
Heluet. ^. c 19. 21, Heluet. 1* ar. ^0. Basil* ar. 5. 6 Boem c. 11. 13. Fran.

Suea. c. 17. The Papists therefore be in a vvrong opinion which deliver that
The Sacraments are not only seals, but causes of grace. The Sacraments give
grace, even because theie be delivered, and received, ex opere operato. That
is, a cause of unworthy receiving the Sacraments, which in deed is none, as
if a man, or woman do communicate before he have made a full confession of al
his sins with their circumstances unto a Priest. The lack of a true and
lively faith is not a cause, which in deed is the greatest cause in the elder
sort of unworthy receiving the Sacraments.






26. ARTICLE. Of th'un worthiness of the Ministers, which hinder not the effect
of the Sacraments.
ALthough, in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and
sometime the evil have chief authority in the ministration of the word, and
Sacraments: yet for as much as theie do not the same in their own name, but
in Christ's, and do minister by his commission and authority, 1we may use
their ministry, both in bering the word of God, and in the receiving the
Sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ's ordinance taken away by their
wikednes, nor the grace of Gods gifts diminished from such as by faith, and
rightly do receive the Sacraments ministered unto them, which are effectual,
because of Christ's institution and promise, although theie be ministered by
euilmen.

2Nevertheless it appertains to the Discipline of the Church, that inquiry
be made of evil Ministers, and that theie be accused by those that have
knowledge of their offenses, and finally, being found guilty by just
judgment, be deposed.

The Propositions.
1 The Effect of the word, and Sacraments is not hindered by the badnesse of
the Ministers. 2 Evil Ministers are to be searched out, convicted, and deposed,
but orderly, and by the Discipline of the Church.
1 Of the ministers ecclesiastical, the church is to conceive
Not too sinisterlie, as though their unworthiness could make the word and
Sacraments the lesce effectual to such as vvorthelie do hear and receive them.
Not too high lie, as if the dignity of their calling were cause good enough
that what they do or say* ex officio take happy effects This by
The scripture is autorized which teaches us, that* even The wiked Are to be
heard
The scribes and Pharisees sitting in Moses chair. Math. 23. 1. Preaching
Christ, though through envy, strife, and contention. Phil ^. 15.
May minister the Sacraments, as did th'ordinari Jewish Priests and of them
very many most wikced, both before, and when Christ came into the world.
The best are but The ministers of God. 1. Cor. 4. 1. Gods laborers. 1. Cor.

who speaks, or ministers, as what is uttered, and offered from God. The due
consideration hereof will both settle us the more deeply in the truth, and
make us the more earnestly to abhor th'unsound opinions
Of the Who taught that the Sacraments are holy, when theie be administered
by holy men, and not else.
Donatists Pe^lians.
Of Th'anabaptists which will not have the people to use the ministry of evil
ministers. Think the service of wiked ministers unprofitable, and not
effectual.
Of R. H. publishing that it is the calling or duty of every Christian not to
communicate where there is a blind and dumme ministry. Of the Papists. For
who sees not that theie tie the graces of God to the worthiness of persons,
when theie deliver that Some sacraments Bishops, and non else (as Confirmation
and orders) must minister. From some sins the Priest, from some the Bishop,
and from some, the Pope only must absolve. He which enters into holy
wedlock, being before in orders, turns* back after Satan and becomes an
Apostata*



2 Though we hold that the ministry of vviked ministers is not utterly to
be condemned; yet think we not that in the Church of God theie must alvvaies
be suffered. For theie are
Th'euil and unprofitable servant. Math. 25. 26. These which offend. Math.
18. 8. Th'unfauorie salt. Math. 5. 13. Which are carefully to be seen unto,
and if admonitions will not serve, deposed: yet orderly, and by the
discipline of the Church. For that God which appointed a government for the
civil state, has given authority also to his Church, to punish offenders
according to the quality of their offense. And so we may read
In the word of God Math. 18. v. 17. ^8. 1. Cor. 5. 4. etc.
In the confessions of our neighbor churches. Confess. Hell. 2. c. 18. Bohem. c.

God in every congregation authority.
To depose vn^cet Ministers. To punish offenders, against the word of God.



27 ARTICLE. Of Baptism.
Baptism is 1 not only a sign of profession and mark of difference,
wherebie Christian men are discerned from other that be not Christened: 2 but
it is also a sign of regeneration or new birth, wherebie as by an instrument,
theie that receive Baptism rightly, are graffed into the Church, the promises
of forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God, by the
holy Ghost, are visiblie signed and sealed, faith is confirmed, and grace
increased by virtue of prayer unto God.

3 The Baptism of young children is in any wise to be retained in the Church,
as most agreeable with th*institution of Christ.

The Propositions.
1 Baptism is a sign of profession, and mark of difference, whereby
Christian men are discerned from other men that be not Christians. 2 Baptism
is a sign or seal of the regeneration, or new birth of Christians, 3 Infants
are to be Baptized by the word of God.
1 How the Sacraments are tokens, and therefore Baptism is a sign of the
true Church, which be christians, it may be read,

But no part of the true Church does think
That Baptism is only a badge of our profession, and nothing available unto
everlasting life, as some Libertines do hold. which the Bannisht do say.
That the water at Baptism is not holy in respect that it is applied to an
holy use. That th'ordinarie, and common worthiness among the Turks and Jews
is the same to them that baptism is to us.
That of so great efficacy is the Cool or hood of S. Francis, as the Baptism
of Christ, as the Franciscanes do reach. That Original sin is not pardoned in
infants at Baptism, because theie have none original sin at al, which the
Pelagians deliver. As the Papistis do publish.
That none can enter into the state of grace vnlesee he be baptized. That
Baptism serves to the putting* away of Original sin only, and not of
actual sins besides, which the children of God do, and shall commit. That
Baptism brings grace exopere operato, even because it is ministered and
received.
That being once baptized we can no more be tempted, which error the
Iouinians did maintain.


3 Although by expres^^ terms we be not commanded to baptize young
Children: yet, we believe, theie are to be baptized For in as much as in the
word of God we find that
The grace of God i^ universal, and partaineth unto al, therefore the si^ne, or
seal of gra^e is universal, and belongs unto al, so well young, as old.
Baptism is unto us, as Circumcision was unto the Jews but th'infantes of the
Jews, were circumcised, therefore the children of Christians are to be
baptized. Children belong to the kingdom of heaven. Mat. (19. 14.) and are in
the covenant; Therefore the sign of the covenant is not to be denied them.
Christ gave in commandment that without exception al should be baptized
(Math. 28. 19.) Therefore young children are not to be exempted. Christ has
shed his blood as well ^^r washing-awaie the sins of Children as of the elder
sort: Therefore it is very necessary that the^e should be partakers of the
Sacrament thereof. This good Christians which ^^aue renounced popery, as theie
like of, so theie allow the Baptism of young Children, as may appear in the
Confession of

28 ARTICLE. Of the Lords Supper.
THE Supper of the L. is not 1 only a sign of the love that Christians ought
to have among themselves one t'another, but rather 2 it is a Sacrament of our
redemption by Christ's death. Insomuch that such as rightly, worthily, and
with faith receive the same, the bread which we break, is a partaking of the
body of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing, is a partaking of the blood
of Christ. 3 Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of bread and
wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by holy writ: but it is
repugnaunt to the plain words of Scripture, overthrows the nature of a
Sacrament, and has given occasion to many superstitions. 4 The body of
Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after an heavenly and
spiritual manner, and the mean whereby the body of Christ is received, and
eaten in the Supper is Faith. 5 The Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not by
Christ's ordinance reserved, carried-about, lifted-up, or worshipped.

The Propositions.
1 The Supper of the L. is a sign of the love that Christians ought to have
among themselves 2 The L. Supper is a Sacrament of our redemption by Christ's
death, and to them which receive the same worthelie by faith, a partaking of
the body and blood of Christ. 3 The bread and wine in the L. Supper, be not
changed into another substance. 4 The body of Christ is given, taken, and
eaten, after an heavenly and spiritual, and not after a carnal sort. 5 To
reserve, carie-about, lift-up, or worship the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is
contrary to th'ordinaunce of Christ.
1 The Supper of the Lord is a token of the love that Christians ought to have
among them selves. For which cause it is called
The Lords table. 1. Cor 10. 21 The Lords Supper. 1. Cor. 11. 20. A communion

Churches besides, as may appear by the ^onfession of
Heluet. 2. c. 21. Basil. art. 6. Bohe. c. 13 Fland. art. 35. Saxon. art. 14.
Sueau. c. 18 So think not those men
Which contemn this Sacrament of Love, with Th'anabaptistes. which rail upon
it, being used after the institution of Christ, and call it With the Papists.
A Table
Profane. Detestable
The cup of devils, A kind of idolatrous meats.
Which deny it many Christians, and all owe it only to a few Antichristian
shauelings. Which abuse it, with Halters, and hollow hearted Christians, and
Corinthians, that will Drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of the devils.
Participate at the Lords table, and at the table of devils.

Is to al christians a Sacrament of our redemption by Jesus Christ Math. 26.

Christ. 1. cor. 10. 16.
worthelie. 1. Cor. 11. 28. etc. By faith. 2. Cor. 13. 5. John. 6. 35 A truth,
this is, not only in heart believed, but by publik writings al so testified
to the world by our neighbor Churches. Confess. of
Heluet. 2. cap. 11. Heluet. 1 art. 22. Basil. art. 6. Bohem. ca 13. France.
art 37. Flan. art. 35. Ausb. touching the Masce, art. 1. 3. Sax. art. 14.
VVittem cap. 19. Suca. c. 19. This proposition diversely has bin assailed. For
Some either deniing, or not acknowledgeing the benefits of this so heavenly a
Sacrament do say. It is not a seal of spiritual graces, but only a sign
of Christian profession. It is to be received only for obedience take to the
Princes procedings, but is of non effect to the perfect ones: an opinion of the
Family. It does neither good, nor hurt to the receauers; the Mescalians error.
It is not a sign assuring the hearts of the faithful how their sins be
forgiven. For we must alvvaies doubt of the remission of our sins, say the
Papists. It is to be received to the comfort of the body only, but is no
refreshing of the soul.
Some have conceived, and do hold most erroneous opinions touching the manner
of receuing the same, delivering to the world, that It can profit such as have
no faith, even Babes, or infants; in this error were the Nectorians Graecians,
Moranians, that I say not Cyprian, Origin. Austine. VViked men, destitute of
al knoledge, and true sense of godliness, and for no cause, but only because
theie receive the same. The dead bodies of men, th'error of certain, condemned
long ago.
It can benefit such as recaue it not at al, if it be ministered on their
behalf, being These errors the Papists stifelie do defend.
Absent upon the seas in wars, yea, by death. Praesent, and yet do not
participate but the Priest for them.





3 Transsubst^tiation* or the change of the substance of bread and wine in the
supper of the Lord, we do utterly deny, and the reasons moving us thereunto,
are, for that
It is repugnant to the plain words of the Scripture. For I will not drink
henceforth of this fruit of the vine, says our Savior Christ (Matt. 26, 29.
Mar. 14, 25.) which fruit had it realie bine either the blood, o^, by way of
concomitance, the very body and blood of Jesus Christ, then our Lord and
Savior had* eaten himself, which is not only blasphemous to be spoken, but
also impossible to be done, and directly against the word of God, where
commandment is often given, that the blood with flesh (not of beast, much
less of man) must not be eaten. Genesis 9, 4. Leuit. 17, 14. The heaven must
contain Jesus Christ until the time that al things be restored, says Saint
Peter, Acts. 3. 21. If Christ corporalie, according to his humanity, be in
heaven, then is he not in the Sacrament. As often as ye shall eat this bread'
(not Christ his real body) and drink this cup, (not the real blood of Christ)
ye show the Lords death til he come, says Saint Paul, ^. Cor. 11, 20.
Therefore he is not come, which he must be, being under the forms of bread and
wine.
It overthrows the nature of a Sacrament. For where there is none element,
there can be no Sacrament. Because the word coming unto Th'element, makes a
Sacrament. It has bine the occasion of many superstitions. For from hence
proceeded The reserving of the transsubstantiated bread, for sundry
superstitious ends. Th'adoring of the bread, even as God himself, and that of
priest and people. The carieng-about in pompous procession of their wa^er God.
The popish feast, called Corpus Christi day. The due consideration hereof has
moved the reformed Churches to detest transsubstantiation as in heart and word:
so by writing Confess. of
Hell. 2. cap. 21. Hell. 1. art. 22. Basil. art. 6. Bohem. c. 13. VVittem. c. 19.
Abominable therefore be the popish errors, that
In Th'eucharist there is not the substance of bread and wine, but only the
mere accidents and qualities. Substancialie, and realie the body and blood
together with the soul, and divinity of our L. Jesus Christ, and therefore
whole Christ is contained in the sacrament of Eucharist. Under each kind, and
under every part of each kind seueralie, whole Christ is comprised. After the
consecration in the wonderful Sacrament of Th'ucharist, the body and blood of
our Lord Jesus Christ is, and that not only in the use, while it is taken,
but before also, and after in the hosts or consecrated pieces, reserved or
remaining after the communion. In the holy Sacrament Christ, th'onelie
begotten son of God, is to be adored with the very worship of Latria. Marcus
also, that detestable haeretike, held that the wine of the lords Supper was
converted into blood.



4 Although our Savior Christ be in heaven, as has bine proved, and therefore
can not corporalie be given, taken* and eaten, yet we believe that by a secret,
and incomprehensible virtue of the holy Ghost, he does nurish and quicken us
by his very body and blood apprehended by a lively faith For the better
understanding of this great mystery, we are to note that the regenerate have
a double life with*in them, whereof
One is carnal, and temporary, which theie have brought with them from their
first coming into the world. This life is common to al men, good and bad; and
is praeserued by earthly and material bread, common also to al and every man.
One is spiritual and heavenly, given unto them in their second birth, which is
through the word. 1 Pet. 1. 23. This life is peculiar only to the elect of
God, and maintained by the bread of life which came-downe from heaven, which
is Jesus Christ (John. 6, 51) He nurisheth and susteineth the spiritual life of
all Christians, if he be eaten, that is received of them spiritualie through
faith. (John. 6, 35. Romans 3, 25*) which spiritual bread that he might the
better repraesent, he has instituted earthly and visible bread, and wine,
for a Sacrament of his body and blood; whereby he does testify, that as
verelie as we receive the Sacrament with hands, and eat the same with mouth
and teeth, to the nurishing of this transitory life: even so truly by faith
(which is in place of hands, and mouth to the soul) we receive the true
body, and the true blood of Christ our only Savior, to the cherishing of
the spiritual life in oursoules* The churches of God elsewhere reformed agree
with us in this point. Confess. of
Heluet 2. cap. 21. Heluet. 1. art. 22. Basil. art. 6* Bohem. c. 13. France.

Of the Capernaits, which thought the flesh of the Lord might be eaten with
man's mouth. Of the Synusiasts Vbiquitaries. Who think the body of Christ so
is praesent in the supper, that his very body with bread and wine, by one
and the same mouth* at one and the same time, is eaten corporalie, and devoured.
Of the Metusiasts. Papists. Which believe the substance of bread and wine is
so changed into the substance of christ his body, that nothing remains but
the real body of Christ, besides th'accidents of bread and wine.

of opinion that the faithful receive nothing but the naked and bare signs.

was ordained to the end that

but bread only, and not the cup also. The Papists, though theie use both
kinds; yet theie deny the Cup unto the people, yea, and to Clergy men too,

31 ARTICLE. Of th'oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross.
TH'offring of Christ once made 1 is that perfect redemption propitiatio^, and
satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual, and
there is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. 2 UUherefore the
sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said that the Priests did
offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain and
guilt, were blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceites.

The Propositions.
1 The blood of Jesus Christ once shed for mankind upon the Cross, is a
perfect redemption propiciation and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole
world. 2 The Sacrifices of Masses are most blasphemous fables, and dangerous
deceites.
1 Of the benefits redounding unto man kind by christ his offeringvp of
himself upon the cross we have in sundry places elsewhere written, and
proved by the word of God, that Jesus Christ is that perfect and only

her passion.

Though Christ have suffered for all men in general: yet every man must suffer
for himself in particular. Yea, one man may satisfy for another by the
Papists doctrine.

Sin, do hold that Christ has satisfied and was of fered only for original
sin and not for actual. An error of Tho. Aquinas. Sins actual and Venial are to
be taken away By sacred Ceremonies. By a Bishops blessing. By a Priests
absolution.
Mortal be forgiven sometime by a pardon from A Bishop* The Pope






2 The Papists do ^a^^ that the Mass is
A Sacrifice. A Sacrifice propitiatory. A Sacrifice propitiatory for the
quick Dead.
The same propitiatory Sacrifice that was offered by Christ himself, upon the
cross. A Sacrifice, in which* by the virtue of a few, even five words
mumbled-vp of a Priest, Christ, even that Christ, which hung upon the Cross,
is contained. A Sacrifice serving For all persons. Quick Dead To purge the^
from their sins T'ease them of their pains* To satisfy for their punishment.

For all necessities Corporal. Spiritual.

A Sacrifice propitiatory of Jesus Christ realie offered to God the Father,
and that often and only in the honor of dead Saints. A Sacrifice where* in
Christ is so gloriously, that it is to be adored even with divine worship
both of Priest and people. A Sacrifice meritorious to al them for whom it is
offered, though there be not among the living, but dead; and though living, yet
absent; and though present, yet without zeal, knowledge, or faith, and that
ex opere operato. VVher bie we may note
Blasphemous fables. For it is A fable that the Mass is a Sacrifice, and that
propitiatory. A fable that a few words of a Priest, can change bread into a
living body, yea, many bodies, with their souls, and that of Jesus Christ,
God and man A fable that one, and the same sacrifice is offered in the Mass
which was offered on the Cross. A fable that it is any whit profitable for
the quick, much less for the dead*
Dangerous deceits. For herebie among other things men are to believe that
Creatures may be adored: the contrary is, Exodus 20. 4, Christ is often
offered* contra. Heb. 19 12. etc. The Priest offers up* Christ; contra. Heb.
9. 14. Sins be forgiven without blood; contra. Heb. 9. 22 Christ died not
once, but daily; contra Heb. 9. 27. Faith is not necessary in co^municants;
for whether there believe or no, their sins may be remitted by a Mass;
co^tra. Heb. 11. v* 4. 6 We are not to remember Christ absent, but to adore
him praesent; contra. Luke 22. 19. 1. cor 11. 25. The favor of God may be
purchased with money from a Priest: contra. 1. Pet. 1. v. 18. 19. Which their
fables, and deceites ^e^d to th'abolishing of true religion. Therefore justly

32 ARTICLE. Of the marriage of Priests.
BIshops, Priests, and Deacons 1 are not commanded by Gods law, nether to vow
the estate of single life, or to abstein from marriage. Therefore it is lawful
also for them 2 as for all other Christian men to marry at their own
discretion, as theie shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.

The Propositions.
1 By the word of God it is lawful for Bishops, and other Ecclesiastical
Ministers, to marry at their own discretion. 2 It is lawful by the word of
God for all Christian men, and women, to marry at their discretion in the fear
of God.

33 ARTICLE. Of Excommunicate persons, how theie are to be avoided.
THe person 1 which by open denownciation of the Church, is rightly cut-of
from th'unitie of the Church, and Excommunicated, ought to be taken of the
whole multitude of the faithful, as are heathen and Publicane, 2 until he be
openly reconciled by Poenaunce, and received into the Church by a judge that
has authority thereunto.

The Propositions.
1 The person that is rightly by the Church Excommunicate, is of all the
faithful to be taken for an Heathen and Publicane. 2 An Excommunicate person,
truly repenting, is to be received into the Church again.
1 The most severe, and uttermost punishment that the visible Church can
inflict upon the vviked and ungodly o^ this world, is excommunication a part
of discipline to be exercised, and that upon most urgent occasions; and it is
Commended to the Church even by God himself; who in his word has prescribed
Who are to excomunicate, ^^^elie, such as have authority in the Church.

open reprehension. 1. Tim. 5, 20. By public sentence of the church To put him
away from the company of the faithful. 1. Co. 5, ^3 To deliver him unto
Satan. 1* Cor. 5, 5. To denunce him An heathen. A publican A cursed. A man so
cut off from the church and excommunicated, is of every man to be avoided

Which simply condemn al excommunication, saying, the vviked are not to be
excommunicate, such were the Paulicians. Which excommunicat either whom
theie should not, or to a wrong end So Th'apostolikes did excommunicate all that were married, and for no cause, but for that theie were married. Christ
prophesied that his disciples, and faithful people, should be excommunicated.
John. 16. ^ Dio^^ephes did thrust out the brethren out of the Church. 3. John.

So The Papists did, when theie excommunicated, and that being dead the dead

The Papists do in thundering their Bulls of excommunication against the most

Theie do which exercise excommunication not of any conscience, but for gain;
where it comes that excommunication is Not regarded of inferiors. Derided of
Superiors.


Which savor the right excommunication, but exercise it not, being bound
thereunto. These are to be rebuked as was The Corinthians of S. paul 1. Cor. 5.

2 Sundry be the reasons and ^^^es vvhic excommunication is used, as
That a vviked liver, to the reproach of the Gospel, be not suffered among the
professors of true religion; and many good be not evil spoken of, for a ^evve
bad. That the good be not corrupted, or infected through the continual, or
often familiarity of the vviked. 1. Cor. ^, 6. That he which has fallen,
through shame of the world may at the length Learn to to blaspheam no more.
1. Tim. 1. 20. Through repentance be saved. 1 Cor. 5. 5. Among al other causes
therefore of excommunication, one is, that the person excommunicate may not
be condemned utterly, but return unto the Lord by repentance, and so be
received* again into the visible Church, as S. Paul willed th'incestuous man
should be (1. Cor. 2. 7. etc) This truth I know none that denies, unless it
be certain
Montanistes. Nouatians. Fantastical Anabaptists. which are of opinion that
al theie which sin after baptism, without al hope of reconciliation, be
damned.



34 ARTICLE. Of the traditions of the Church.
IT is not necessary that traditions and ceremonies 1 be in all places one, or
utterly like, for at al times theie have bin diverse, and may be changed
according to the diversities of Countries, times and men's manners, so that
nothing be ordained against Gods word. 2 Whosoever through his private
judgment, willingly and purposelie does openly break the traditions and
ceremonies of the Church, 3 which be not repugnant to the word of God, and be
ordained and appointed by common authority, ought to be ^ebuked openly (that
other may fear to do the like) as he that offends against the common order
of the Church, and hurts th'auctoritie of the Magistrate, and wounds the
consciences of the weak brethren. 4 Eue^e particular or national Church has
authority to ordain, change, and ^bolish ceremonies, or rites ordained
only by man's authority, so that al things be done to aedifieng.

The Propositions.
The same traditions or ceremonics are not to be like in all places. No private
man of a selfe-wil, and purposelie may in public, violate the traditions and
ceremonies of the Church, which by common authority be allowed, and are not
repugnaunte to the word of God. Ceremonies and traditions, ordained by
th'auctoritie of man, if theie be repugnant to Gods word, are not to be kept
and observed of any man. Every particular, or national Church male ordain,
change, and abolish ceremonies, or rites ordained only by man's authority, so
that al things be done to aedifieng.
1 If a necessity were laid upon the church of God to observe one, and the
same traditions and ceremonies at al times, and in all places, assuredly
The ceremonies of the old Law had not bine* as theie are now abolished: Acts.
6, 14. 10, 13. etc. 15, 1. etc. Gal. 2, 3. etc. Ephesians. 2. 14. Col, 2. 16.
The Apostles would never have given such praesidents of altering them upon
special reasons, as theie have don. For we find that they changed The times
and places of their assembling together. For the people of God ^et, and

Church bound to th'obseruation of al traditions, and ceremonies which are
allowed by lavvful authority, and are not repugnant to the word of God For
he that violateth them, contemns not man, but God, who has given power to
his Church to establish whatsoever things make unto (1 Cor. 14. ver. 40. 26)

observation of al ceremonies, and Rites.




3 Of ceremonies and traditions repugnant to the word of God, there be two
sorts, where of
Some are of things mere lie vviked such Was Th'israelites calfe. Exodus 32. 4
etc. Nebuchadnezar^ Idol. Dan. 3. 1. etc.
Are the Papistical Images. Relics. Agnus deis. Crosces. To which theie give
divine adoration.
These are flatly forbidden of the Lord. Exodus 20. 4.


Some are of things neither commanded, nor forbidden, as Of eating, or not
eating flesh. Of wearing, or not wea ring some apparel. Of keeping or not
keeping of some days holy etc. Which are not to be observed, when it is
delivered as sound doctrine, that such works
Do merit remission of sins, Are th'acceptable service of God. Do more please
than th'obseruation of the laws of God. Are necessarily to be done insomuch
that theie are damned which do them not. For th'auoiding of al these, we must
remember that we are bought with a price, and therefore may not be the
servant of men (1. Cor. 7. 23.) and that none humain constitution in the
church, does bind any man to break the least commandment of God. Act. 5.
29. The consideration here of, has caused other Churches also with a svveete
consent to condemn such wiked ceremonies of man. Confel. of

4 It has pleased our most merciful Lord, and Savior Christ, for the
maintenance of his Church militant, that two sorts of rites, or ceremonies
should be used, whereof
Some, God his most excellent majesty himself has ordained, such is the
ceremony of. Baptism. The L. Supper. Which are til the end of the world
without al addition, diminution and alteration with all zeal, and religion to
be observed.

Some be ordained by the authority of each prouincial, or national Church,
and that for The Comlines of the Church that is to say* that By those helps
the people of God may the better be inflamed with a god lie zeal. Sobrenes
and gravity may appear in the well handling of Ecclesiastical matters.
Order sake, even That governors may have rules and directions how to govern
by. That auditors may know how to prepare, and behave themselves in divine
service. That a ioiful peace may be among al men by the well ordering of
Church affairs. We have proved already that such traditions may be made,
and changed, augmented and diminished as fit time, and opportunity shall be
ministered; and that not by the Catholic (for that is, and has always bin
impossible) but by particular Churches The Effect here of we may read in the
Confess. of
Heluet. 2. c. 27 Bohem. c. 15. Fran. art 32. Flan. art 32. Ausbur. touching
abuses ar 7. VVitte. art. 35. Sueaue. ca. 14. This shows th'intolerable
arrogance of the Church of Rome, which dare take upon her
To alter the Sacraments ordained eue^ by Christ himself. To praescribe
rites and ceremonies, not to some particular churches but to the whole church
militant.




35 ARTICLE. Of Homilies.
THE second book of Homilies, the several title whereof, we have joined under
this article, does contain a godly, and wholesome doctrine, and necessary for
these times, as does the former book of Homilies, which were set forth in the
time of Edward the sixte: and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches
by the Ministers diligently and distinctlie, that there may be understood
of the people.

Of the names of the Homilies.
1 Of the right use of the Church. 2 Against peril of Idolatry. 3 Of the
repairing, and keeping clean of the Churches. 4 Of good works, first of
Fasting. 5 Against gluttony, and drunkenness. 6 Against excess of apparel. 7
Of Prayer. 8 Of the place and time of prayer. 9 That common prayers, and
Sacraments ought to be ministered in a known tongue 10 Of the reverent
aestimation of gods word 11 Of Alms doing. 12 Of the Nativity of Christ. 13
Of the Pascion of Christ. 14 Of the Resurrection of Christ. 15 Of the worthy
receiving of the Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ. 16 Of the gifts
of the holy Ghost. 17 For the Rogation days. 18 Of the state of Matrimony.
19 Of Repentance. 20 Against Idleness. 21 Against Rebellion.
The second book of Homilies, as also the former, I doubt not, contain
godly and wholesome doctrine, necessary for this time. But for so much as this
is none Article of the Catholic Religion, but a private Article for our
Church, neither yet for the whole church of England, but for some places, where,
and for some time, when able and fit Ministers are not praesent to preach the
word of God, and serves only (as both from the book of Common prayer, may
well be gathered ( Obseruat. next after Nicen Cr^ed
) and experience proves) for an Interim as it were, til fit Pastors be
provided for: and again, because most of those Homilies, according to their
several titles, have bine already handled in this, and the other part of my
subscription, I cease from further wrighting of the same in this place.

36 ARTICLE. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.
THE book of Consecration of Archbishopps, and Bishops, and ordering of
Priests and deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the sixth, and
confirmed at the same time by authority of parliament, does contain al things
necessary to such consecration and ordering: neither has it any thing, that
of it self is superstitious or ungodly. And therefore, whosoever are
consecrated, or ordered according to the rites of that book, since the second
year of the aforementioned K. Edward, unto this time, or hereafter shall be
consecrated, or ordered according to the same rites, we decree al such to be
rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.

This Article simply is none Article of the Catholic Church; and so much
thereof as vniuersalie is received, has already both by the holy Scripture
bin confirmed, and allowed by our neighbor Churches, in the 23. Article.

37 ARTICLE. Of the civil Magistrate.
THe Queens M. 1has the chief power in this realm of Eng. and other her
dominions, 2unto whom the chief government of al estates of this realm, whether
theie be Ecclesiastical, or civil, in all causes does appertain, and is not,
nor ought to be subject to any foraine jurisdiction. Where we attribute to the
Queens M. the chief government, by which titles, we understand the minds of
some slanderous folks to be offended: 3we give not to our Princes, the
ministering either of Gods word, or of Sacraments, the which Th'iniunctions
also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Q. does most plainly testify: but
that only prerogative, which we see to have bine given always to al godly
princes in holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that theie should rule al
estates, and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether theie be
Ecclesiastical, or temporal, 4and restrain with the civil sword, the stubborn
and evil doers. 5The 'Bishop of Rome has no jurisdiction in this realm of
Eng. 6The laws of the realm may punish Christian men with death for heinous
and grievous offenses 7It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of
the Magistrate, to wear weapons, and serve in the wars.

The Propositions.
1 The Queens May. has the chief power in this realm of Eng. and other
her dominions. 2 The Queens Majesty has the chief government of al states,
Ecclesiastical and civil, in all causes within her dominions. 3 The civil
Magistrate may not execute th'ecclesiastical duties of preaching, and of
ministering the Sacraments. 4 The civil Magistrate is to restrain with the
material sword, and to punish malefactors, whosoever theie be. 5 The Bishop of
Rome has no jurisdiction in this Realm of England. 6 By the laws of this
Realm Christian men, for heinous and grievous offenses, may be put to death. 7
It is lawful for Christian men, at the commandment of the Magistrate, to
wear wepons, and serve in the wars.

being so, how dare the papists, as they do, say that
The kings excellency of power is in respect of the Nobility, and lay
Magistrates under him, and not in respect of Popes, Bishops or Priests, as they
have rule of souls? Kings* and princes, be (...) never so great must be
subject to some Bishop? Priest? Praelate?
The whole Clergy ought to be free from paieng tribute. No man is to be
subject to his temporal Prince, and superior in matters of religion or regiment
of his soul, but in such things only as concern the public peace and
policy? The Papists now in Englang be duly discharged from subjection, and
the Prince from dominion by the soueraignt authority of the common pastor of
Religion, which is the Pope.





3 K. Ezechias said unto the Priests and Levites of his time, My sons, be
not deceived, for the Lord has chosen you to stand before him, to serve him*
and to be his Ministers, and to burn incense (2 Chronicles. 29. 1^.): So do we
say. The Lord has appointed a company to teach the people, to celebrat the
Sacraments, to handle the keis of the celestial kingdom; in so much that he
that shall praesume to do these things, not called there unto and that
lavvfullie, though he be a King, he may fear that punishment which ^el upon

The Cresconians are of an opinion that the Magistrates ar to punish no

the good, but an humane invention for the hurt of man. Th'anab aptists deliver
that before the resurrectio^ther shalnot be any magistrates; for all the wiked
shall be rooted out. The like fancy have the Fam. of Love. The Papists think
that the Clergy are not to be punished, or corrected of the civil magistrate.




5 The Bishop of Rome did he
Preach the Gospel (1. Cor 9 v. 16, 17. 1. Tim. 4, 2. Mat. 28. 19 Labor in the
Lord his harvest Mat. 9, 38. Divide the word of God a^ight. (^. Tim. ^, 15.)
Minister the Sacraments, instituted by Christ, and that syncerelie. (Matt. 28,
19. 1. Cor. 10, 16.) Show by his life the goodfruits of a godly Bishop (1. Tim.
3, 2. etc. Tit. 1, 7. etc) Doubtless he were worthy of double honor by the
word of God (1. Tim* 5. 17) yet will not the same word of God, were he never so
holy and religious, warrant him any jurisdiction within this realm, much
less when he does execute no part of a Christian, but every part of an
Antichristian Bishop
In corrupting the doctrine of the truth with errors and cursed opinions. In
defacing the sacraments of the church by supersticious ceremonies. In
persecuting the Church of Christ with fire and sword. In making merchandise of
the souls of men, thorough covetousness. 2* Pet. 2, 3. In pl^ieng the Lord
over gods heretage. 1. Pet. 5. 3. In sitting in the temple of God, as God,
showing himself that he is God. 2. These. 2 4. In exalting himself against all that is called god, or that is worshipped. 2. These. 2, 4. In respect of which

He is described in the holy scripture to be very Antichrist, eue^ The
wikedman. That man of sin. The son of p^idition. Th'aduersarie of God. 2.
These. 2, 3. etc.

He was openly proclaimed Antichrist by a council in France in the reign of
Capet. He is called by the godly learned The prince among all the children of
pride. Very Lucifer. The Basiliske of the Church. The plague of the world.
Neither the head, nor the tail of the Church of God.
His jurisdiction has bine, and is banished out o^ England by many kings and
parliments, namely by K. Edward the 1. 3. 6. Richard the 2. Henry the 4* 8.
His pride and intolerable supremacy is renounced by all the true servants of
God by mouth and writing. Confel. of Hell. 1. 2. 18 Helue. 2 c. 17. 18. Boh. c.

And that upon good cause he is thus detested, it appears as by that already
setdowne: so by that which the Papists themselves give out of their holy
father, as namely that
The pope is In supremacle, Abel. In governing of the A^ke, Noah. In
patriarkship, Abraham. In Order, Melchisedech. In dignity, Aaron. In
authority, Moses. In judgment, Samuel. In zeal, Helias In humility, David.
In power, Peter. In respect of his vn^tion, Christ. The general pastor. The
common father of al Christians. The high pastor of Gods universal Church. The
prince of Gods people. God In title God, even the Lord God the Pope. For power
god By him kings reign. He may judge al, but must be judged of none. He can
do what him list* as well as God, except sin.


He has universal jurisdiction over the whole world. Upon pain of damnation
al christians are to yield obedience to the Pope.




6 As the natures of men be diverse, and sometimes in some countries more abund
than in other: so are the punishments to be imposed upon malefactors according
to the quantity and quality of th'offe^ce; and any country and realm may
punish offenders, and that with death is the laws thereof do so command, and
the case requires. For All that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Matthew. 26, 52. Governors

praise of them that do well.

38 ARTICLE. Of Christian men's goods which are not common.
THE riches and goods of Christians, 1 are not common as touching the right,
title, and possession of the same, as certain Annabaptistes do falselie
boaste. Notwithstanding 2 every man ought of such things as he possesses,
liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.

The Propositions.
1 The riches and goods of Christians, as touching the right, title, and
possession of the same, are not common. 2 Every man is to give liberal alms
of that which he possesses, according to his ability.
1 That which is alleged in the next proposition following does altogether
confirm that which here is affirmed: yet for further proof that the riches and
goods of Christians, as touching the right, title, and possession of the same,

39 ARTICLE. Of a Christian man's oath.
AS we confess 1 that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by
our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his Apostle: 2 So we judge that Christian
religion does not prohibit, but that a man may swear, when the Magistrate
requires, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the
Prophets teaching, in justice, judgment and truth.

The Propositions.
1 We may not swear vainelie, and rashly. 2 A lawful oath may be given, and
taken according to the word of God.
1 The better t'auoide vain and rash swearing it is good to have in
remembrance that which is said
By our Savior Christ in the 5. of Math. ver. 34. Swear not at al, neither By
heaven, for it is the throne of God. By the earth; for it is his footstool. By
Jerusalem; for it is the City of the great King. By thin head, because thou
can not make one hear white, or black. But let your communication be yea*
yea; nay, nay

By The Apostle James Before al things, my brethren, Swear not Neither by the
heaven. Not by the earth. Not by any other oath But let your yea, be yea, and
your nay, nay least ye fall into condemnation. The churches of Heluetia, and
Basil, by their public Confessions do speak against all vain and rash oaths
and swearing
Heluet 1 cap. 5 Basil. art 11. This conde^neth
The Wantons which for pleasure. Covetous that for profit. Blush not to take
the name of god in vain by idle, and rash oaths.

2 Thought it be unlawful to swear vainlie and rashly: yet ar^ mere persons
to take a lawful oath, when just occasion is given. For in his word* God
Has given express commandment so to do, as Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Thou shall sear
the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name. Deuteronomy. 10. 20.
Thou shall swear the Lord lives, and thou shall cleave unto him, and shall
swear by his name.

teach, that an oath for t'accuse th'aduersaries of true Religion, and this
state, who^ theie call Catholics, is not to be taken, if it be, it may and
must be broken under pain of aeternal damnation.
