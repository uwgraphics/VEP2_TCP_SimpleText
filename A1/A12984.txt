A Bartholmew Fairing for Parents, to bestow upon their sons and daughters,
and for one friend to give unto another: Shevving that children are not to
marie, without the consent of their parents, in whose power and choice it
lies to provide wives and husbands for their sons and daughters.

Wherein is sufficiently proved, what in this point is the office of the
fathers and in like manner declared the part and duty of all obedient children.

By John Stockwood, Minister and preacher of Tunbridge.

Ierem. 29.6. Take you wives, and beget sons and daughters, and take wives
for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons
and daughters, that you may be increased there, and not diminished.

LONDON. Printed by John Wolf, for John Harrison the younger, dwelling in Pater
Noster-rowe, at the sign of the golden Anchor. 1589.

To the right worshipful, M. Thomas Skeuington of Skeuington, Esquire, at this
present high Sheriff of Leichestershire and one of her Majesty's Justices of
the peace there: John Stockewood Minister and preacher of the word of God at
Tunbridge in Kent, wishes all felicity of mind and body, through Jesus
Christ our most merciful redeemer.
CHildren (right worshipful) as we al well know, when their parents or any of
those, with who^ they have any familiarity, go unto any fair, use commonly at
their taking their journey to say unto them: I pray you bring me home a
Fayring. And not only children are for the most part thus affected, but we see
it also to be the fashion of others of greater grouth, and further years, when
as at faires they meet with their friends and acquaintance, to be begging
and asking of them: What will you give me for a fairing? And the courtesy that
is this way bestowed, be it in a manner never so small and simple, is
notwithstanding well accepted and kindly taken from the hand of the giver, as
being a sign and token of his good will and loving affection toward the
party, on whom he does bestow the same. This custom simply in it self not to
be condemned (although through abuse the best things may be perverted) I have
at this present framed my self unto, and as I could for the shortness of the
time, prepared this treatise, discoursing upon the office of parents in
providing their children of honest marriages in due season, and showing at large
the duty and obedience of their sons and daughters in this behalf.

How necessary for all sorts of people this my travail (such as it is) may
be, it is not my meaning here in many words to dilate. The general want of
performance of duty in this respect, on the one side by the parents, and on
the other by their children, has bin the foster-nurse, and brood-mother of
many great inconveniences, wherewith both the Church and common wealth, yea and
many private families, are not a little pestered, against the which if by this
my labor, God of his mercy granting unto it this blessing, I may be thought
to have set down some remedy, it shall nothing grieve me to have taken the
same, being glad if any way by my simple service, I can bring any profit vno
the Church of God, the which how much or how little soever it be, who so shall
thereby receive any benefit next unto God he shall be beholding unto your
worship for the same, who have been the chief occasion of the publishing
hereof.

For owing a duty unto you for your courtesy showed, at the request of the
right honorable, the Earl of Huntington, my very singular good Lord and
master, I have ever since been devising, how I might give out some testimony
of my grateful remembrance of this worshipful kindness, and having none other
means of greater valor, I have presumed to give trial thereof by these paper
thanks whereby al posterity may witness, that I acknowledge my self to
remain a debtor unto you for undeserved courtesy extended toward me, the
which, in as much as I am able no other ways to requite, I do in all humility
request your worship to account and reckon me in the number of those, who being
many pleasured by you, though hindmost peradventure in worldly ability, will
be found notwithstanding as forward as the foremost in all dutiful and
thankful good will, as one that hates in the world nothing more than the
most ugly and loathsome monster of ingratitude and unthankfulness. The time
falling out so fitly with the finishing of this work, and publishing the
same, I have given unto it the name of a Bartholmew Fayring, The reason o^ the
Title.
the rather by the novelty of the title to draw on the multitude of people
that now out of all places of our country repair unto the city, to the
better beholding and consideration of the matter contained in the treatise: the
which, as it is general, and concerns all that either are, or may be parents,
or children: so the doctrine marked heedfullie, and practiced accordingly,
cannot choose but fall out auaillable unto many, who learning here, that which
for the most part they were ignorant of, and thought strange before, will
henceforth prove to be more careful fathers in providing christian marriages
for their sons and daughters, and their children more dutiful and obedient
in being ruled by them, and following of their choice, and in diligent
warefulnes, that they entangle and bewrap not themselves in wedlocke-bands
without the consent and liking of their parents. Accept therefore I beseech you
(right worshipful) this simple present as an unfeigned token of my good will,
with that favorable courtesy, wherewith you are wont to embrace others much
bounden welwillers, the which, if you shall vouchsafe me, I have obtained my
desire praying the almighty for ever to protect you. Tunbridge, this 20 August.
1589.

Your W. much bounden in all dutiful and most thankful good will: John
Stockwood.

To all godly Parents, with their like virtuous children, and all other the
Christian Readers, into whose hands this book may come, increase of true
knowledge and sincere practice of the same through Jesus Christ.
IT is not for nothing (right courteous and christian readers) that we have been
by our Savior Christ so many years since beforehand warned of the state and
condition of this woeful and doting world set on fire upon mischief and
iniquity, that the nearer it grows and hasteneth unto his end, the worse and
worse it shall daily wax, insomuch that the Lord when he shall come to judgment,
Luke 18.8.
shall hardly find faith upon the earth. For such are the miseries of our
times, that notwithstanding the plentiful preaching of the Gospel in most
places, sin still reigns in abundance, and iniquity gets more and more
the vpper-hand, insomuch that those enormities and outrages, the which are
condemned by the law of Nature, the word of God, the practice of the godly in
all ages, the testimony of the Heathen, and general consent of all commendable
learning, are notwithstanding of many not only laughed and iested as, but also
sought to be countenanced, and defended (aneuident token of the great
corruption of our age) of such as otherwise want not their due praise for
ciusll conversation and behavior. Among these is not the last nor least, the
too usual bad custom of childrens marrieng, without the consent and allowance
of their parents a sin that nature it self abborreth, and all writers of
the better note, in all ages utterly disalowed, and yet of the greater number
holden and taken for no fault at all, whose error in judgment, arising for the
most part of ignorance, I have fasthfully labored by all sufficsent kind of
proofs in this writing to disprooue, the which not unfitly, nor nigh my
purpose and meaning at the leastwise) offensiuely, I have termed a Bartholmew
fairing, respecting the time, and the great resort that yearly come up to the
fair, who, now if they list may have a novel of small prices but yet of much
value, to bestow upon themselves their children and their friends, worthy I
hope of their reading and much more of their practice, as their several places
and callings shall require. And I have been the more willing to enter into this
course, and vndersaken this matter, that I might discharge some part of a
promise unto diverse my godly friends of Kent and Sussex, which are toward the
right honorable and virtuous Earl of Huntington, unto whom I also my self am
bound in all dutifulnes in the Lord, who by their due right may justly claim
the same as my hand of whom they have all so well deserved, and unto whom I am
sure this treatise will come welcome Howsoever it fall out of some to be
misliked: for concerning them I am fully persuaded, as Joshua speaks of
himself and his. Joshua. 24.16
That they and their houses will serve the Lord. And I make no doubt of alother
zealous Christians, but that this labor shall be well thought off. It is
grown I consesse, albeit unto no great, yet much bigger bulk, then when I
began it, I supposed it should: the Lord having given a further bles^ing unto
it then I looked for, whereby I am comforted, that he will of lake mercy
direct it unto the good and benefit of his Church. Eloquence and rethoricall
florishings, with filed words and brave phrases, are not here to be expected
and looked for, as being such flowers, the which never grew in my barren,
plain, and homely country garden, yet may the herbs that here are to be
found, though not carrieng any outward gay and gallant show, yield an wholesome
and pleasant smell in the nostrels of all godly parents, worn not in the hands,
but in the hearts and minds of all loving and dutiful children, the which
should henceforth of conscience and knowledge put into diligent use and
practice this most necessary and weighty point of duty, the which hither to
of ignorance, and lack of teaching, has of the greater number been neglected,
foreslowed, and ouerpassed.

Vnfeignedlie wishing your knowledge and practice of all necessary duties.
John Stockwood.

That Marriages are not to be made without the consent of Parents.
AMong many other vices, wherewith the world at this day is full fraughted,
insomuch that the very elements themselves, together with the rest of the
creatures (as S. Paul in his 8 Cap. Romans 8.20.21.22.23.
unto the Romans does teach us) do groan under the burden of them, looking
for a change, from the vanity whereunto they are made subject through the
sin of man, that they may be restored unto the glorious liberty of the
sons of God, this one is neither the least nor the last, whereby youth for
the most part is grown unto such a pass, that forgetting al childlike
affection and dutiful obedience unto father and mother in the highest point of
subjection, the which they owe unto them in this life, and whereupon depends
their making or marring (as they say) together with the continual joy or
sorrow of their parents they wholly follow their own will and let out the
raines unto their own unbridled and unsettled lusts, making matches according
to their own fickle fantasies, and choosing unto themselves yokefellowes after
the outward deceiuable direction of the eye, nothing regarding the sound
advice of a mind guided with the knowledge and fear of God, the which
counsels to respect the inward graces and ornaments of the soul, and not
to be enamoured with the outward garnishing, beauty, br^^uerie and decking of
the body. And here of it comes to pass, Genesis 6.1.
that men in their marriages following the manners of the sons of the first
forlorn world, seeing the daughters of men to be beautiful and pleasing unto
the eye, take unto themselves of all that they like, not waiting nor staieng
for the choice of their parents, by whose authority, if they ought to be
directed in the matters of smaller weight and less importance, If obedience
due unto parents in the smallest matters, much more in the greater.
as now is so shameless and void of grace, that he dare to deny, how much
more are they then to be ruled by their grave advice in this which chiefly
concerns Gods glory, their own welfare, the chearing and reioicing of them
that have begotten them.

But like as in the first age of the world, this sin is in the place of Genesis
before recited, reckoned up by the holy Ghost for one of the principal causes
that moved God to set wide open the windows of heaven, and to pour down
rain in such fearful abundance, as that in the raging force and swelling
stream of the same, man with all other creatures miserably perished, those
only excepted, the which were preserved in the Arc so questio^les we do owe
most of the plagues, wherewith now a days God punishes this present age, and
in the end will in fearful manner consume the same unto this great and maine
sin of children their matching in marriage without the counsel and advice, nay
spite of the teeth of their godly parents. For marriage being the means the
which God himself has ordained and sanctified for the propagation and
increase of mankind, that being taken in hand in his fear, a godly seed being
multiplied and grown up here on earth the same may be blessed to the
constitution and making of a Church, the which may serve him in holiness and
righteousness: when the same is taken in hand with the breach of his
commandment, so far off is it, that any blessing is to be hoped for, that
contrariwise his hot indignation and heavy curse hangs over that house and
family, Marriage taken in hand with the breach of God. commandment, can not
prosper.
where the parties which are the principal pillars and vpholders of the same,
are linked andtied together in such a ba^d of wedlock, whose links and
inclosings are not fastened and coupled together with the necessary and
lawful assent and liking of the parents, whose authority and consent ought
to bear the chiefest sway, and strike likewise the greatest stroke in this
most holy and heavenly action. And like as marriage is begone and enterprised in
the fear of God according to his word, there God is well pleased, there the
parties so matched live together in a joyful agreement and liking the one of
the other, there God is honored and served in synceritie and truth, there the
children, when God gives them, with the rest of the family are instructed and
brought up in the knowledge of religion, and grounds of faith: so on the other
side, the regard of that which God especially commands, being shut out of our
marriages, there must needs ensue his dislike, and displeasure, there is iar
and discord, there Gods honor is neglected, there houshold-discipline and
christian-instruction of such as belong unto our chardge, goes utterly to
wrack, and is nothing at all regarded. And no marueil: for, if where God
blesses, all things go well and do prosper, then consequently where he
curses, there nothing thriueth, has good success, or goes happily forward.

Now if any shall suppose that these speeches are but words of course, and
carry a gallant show, without any substance or proof of matter, pointing
rather unto such an order as we would have, or wish to be observed in the
matches of our children, then showing by good evidence that so it ought indeed
and of right to be, it is now time that we draw somewhat nearer unto the
question, the which upon weighty consideration we have taken in hand, The
principal drift and purpose of this Treatise.
and by Gods assistance mean to prove: which is, that children may not mary
without the consent and agreement of their parents. And this I hope shall in
such sort be performed, as that it shall plainly appear, that not only the
consent of father and mother is chiefly requisite in the case of marriage, but
also in the former ages and more ancient times of this world, always declining
from better to worse, that the choice it self of wives for the sons, and
husbands for the daughters, rested wholly in the power and authority of the
parents, insomuch that not only the better sort of the children of the godly
referred the whole care of their bestowing this way unto the provident election
of their fathers and mothers, but the very heathen themselves that were not
altogether past grace, and had clean shaken of the yoke of dutiful obedience,
would not so much as once vouchsafe to hear of the motion of any match for
themselves in the state of wedlock, except the choice of their fathers and
mothers had gone before.

First then I willay this down for the foundation, whereupon the rest of the
building shall be framed, the which is granted and agreed upon among all the
learned: namely, that howsoever the mind of man since and through the fall of
our first parents, is blinded and darkened, God has planted certain general
principles, and grounds of true thin the hearts of all men.
yet God has left some small and general sparkles of light in the same, the
which the very heathen have acknowledged, and received for undoubted trueths,
and there is none so blunt and shameless, that he can gain say them, as for
example: That we ought not to hurt or wrong any man: That we must give to every
one that which is his. And (which is the head and chief of all, concerning our
outward behavior, and such dealinges as usually do fall out between man and
man) Do not that unto another, the which thou would not have to be done
unto thy self. with many other such like, the which we otherwise term The
law of nature, or of nations, be cause they are naturally engraven and written
in the hearts of all men, Romans 1.13.
and approved and received with the general consent of all nations, yea and
that so far forth, that those which do violate and break them were worthy of
death, as the bolie Apostle himself somewhere in words does testify and
witness: if therefore it be a principle that no man doubts of, That we should
do as we would be done unto, and that we ought not to do unto others that
thing, the like whereof we would be grieved and offended, they should do unto
us: The first reason from the law of nature
I appeal to the conscience of all graceless sons and daughters, as now a
^aies (the more is the pity) in too great multitudes betroth themselves in
marriage without the priuitie, nay against the will of their fathers and mother,
whether that they would take it in good part at the hands of their children, if
they should in like manner provide themselves of wives and husbands, their good
will and consent being not first obtained before, if there be none having any
conscience at all, but that the same duly examined every night when he goes
unto his bed, tells him that he would not thus himself be served: let this
rule then be sufficient to teach him, that he also ought not to marie without
the well liking and agreement of his father and mother. Would not thou
whatsoever thou art, that thy child, if thou carry any fatherly mind toward
him, should in his matching and marrieng be advised and directed by thee? And
dare thou affiance and assure thy self unto an other in the most honorable
and holy estate of marriage, without the knowledge and counsel of thy father?
Thou thy self the more dearly and tenderly thou love thine own child, the
more deeply will thou be touched with grief and sorrow in thy very
innermost bowels and affections, he, if he bestow himself contrary to thy
liking, and can those that begat thee, think thou, rejoice and be glad,
when thou have wedded contrary unto their mind and good liking? Do therefore
as thou would be done unto: Marie with the consent of thy parents, as thou
would that thy children should do with thine. And as thou would not that
those under thy government should ioin in matrimony against thy will, so in
any case take heed, that thou contract not thy self according to thine own
pleasure, but stay for the direction and good advice of thy father, for it is
an hard matter to have the testimony of thine own conscience to be always
accusing thee that thou have done amiss, and contrary unto that obedience,
the which thou owe unto thy superiors, and look also that thy children
should perform unto thee.

Secondly, that these privy contracts, that is to say, The second reason
taken from the authority of parents over their children
such as are made in secret, or in corners, or otherwise in place never so
public without the consent of the parents, are not lawful, may this way more
plainly appear, if we weigh and consider, that children are not at their own
liberty, and disposition, nor (as they say) their owne-men, but under the
authority and power of their parents, like as servants are at the disposing
of their masters. Nay they are so much more bound unto their fathers and
mothers then servants are, or can be under the power of their masters, by how
much next under God, they do owe their very being unto those that begat them,
which they do not unto their masters, and therefore is the band of their
obedience greater and straighter unto their fathers, then is that of servants
unto their masters. Here of it follows that those which are alike subject
unto the government of others, are also alike debarred from the same freedoms
and liberties, that otherwise, if they were not thus subject, they might enjoy:
but servants and children are tied with a like and equal band of subjection
insomuch that if in this behalf there be any ods, it is in this, that children
owe more duty unto their fathers then servants unto their masters, as was
proved a little before: they are therefore debarred from the same liberty and
freedom, whereof ensues, that if servants have not this liberty without the
leave of their masters to betake themselves unto others, no more may children
without the authority of their parents, affiance and betroth themselves in
marriage unto others: but servants are by the laws, as the learned do know
(and I speak of the laws and servants, The laws of elder times restrain
servants ^^o liberty at their own pleasure to be take themselves to others
without the leave of their masters.
not as they are with us at this day, but as they were in the more ancient and
elder times) restrained of this liberty to place themselves with others
against the will of their masters, therefore children may not give themselves
in matrimony unto others without the consent of their progenitors. And albeit
that by the laws of our own land now in force there be as yet no prouiso
made against the matching of servants without the approbation and allowance of
their masters, yet (under the correction of others) it seems unto me great
reason, that where there are no parents, even in those places the servants,
should take the direction of their godly masters in this behalf, in which my
judgment I am not singular, but can, if need be avouch mine assertion by the
authority of the learned But what shall this need, when as the equity here
of may be inferred of that which we read in the books of Moses, where, such as
please with diligence to confer the places, Exodus 21. Leuit. 25. Deuteronomy. 15.12.
they may easily find, that such serua^te as were Ebrues, though the time of
their service was shorter then was theirs, which were strangers and of other
nations, yet during the space of their years they had to serve in, they were
not to marie at their own liberty, but their masters hand bare the chief
stroke in this business. This course being observed in the Ebrue servants, it
will not, as I take it be gainsaid, that servants of other people and
countries, whose bondage in many respects was far heavier, were likewise
deprived of this liberty of marrying, during the time of their servitude and
thraldom, without the appointment of their Lords and masters: yet hereby is
not meant to preiudicate or impeach, much less to controlle the liberty of
our laws, or lawmakers, in such cases as God has left free unto them, but
only out of that which God himself set down unto his own people in
debarring servants, as servants to make their own choice in cases of marriage,
to prove that children, which are in as great or rather greater subjection
unto their fathers authority, are likewise bound by as hard a band to tarry for
the consent of their parents in their contractes of matrimony.

Thirdly, the great soueraintie, The third reason taken from the large
iurildiction and power the which in ancient times has bin permitted unto
parents over their children, the which custom, albeit that it be not simply
to to be allowed yet it proos ueth their for ueraintie in other matters to be
well per lourmed by their children without any inconvenience.
rule and power that by the law of Moses was given unto the Jewish fathers over
their children, and by the ordinances of the Romans to the parents over their
sons and daughters, by virtue whereof the one in cases of necessity might
sell their children for bondslaues to relieve themselves, and the other might
kill them in revenge of their own private injuries done unto themselves, or
public enormities offered unto others, albeit that of Moses may be thought to
be permitted, like as other things for a time in regard of the hardness of
their heart, and this of the Romans deserve justly to be condemned as
barbarous, cruel, and savage, yet do they both argue, that if parents
authority were in those times so large in things that seem so hardly to be
digested, that they had a far greater authority in those matters and duties,
the which might be performed with more conscience, and much less difficulty
and danger, namely in bearing chiefest sway in the marriage of their children,
and in other causes of like dutiful obedience. The fourth reason from the
condition of goods unto the power that the owners have over the same


To this may be added, that the children are worthelie to be reckoned among the
goods and substance of their fathers, and that by a more especial right then
any thing else, the the which belongs unto their possession, as those which
are more neerlie linked and joined unto them, and which cost them more dearly,
being flesh of their flesh, and bone of their bone, and without whom, they had
never bone: so that they owe themselves wholly unto them in all manner of
obedience and dutiful affection, and shall in seeking to betroth themselves at
their own pleasures, not regarding to have the good will and leave of their
parents, deal as preposterouslie, and ouerthwattlie, as if the goods should
go about to dispose the owner and possessor of the same, and not be disposed
and ordered by those unto whom the possession and property of the same does
by right and equity belong and appertain: for it stands with great reason,
that the owner dispose of the goods, and not contrariwise the goods of the
owner, which were in deed a thing very absurd or contrary to all reason. Now
if any shall doubt, Children are the goods of the parents.
whether that the children be to be reckoned among the goods of their
parents or no, he seems to be ignorant of that point the which the devil
himself well enough understood, as we may read in the first of Job, where it
is set down, that when God gave him leave to deal withal that Job had, he
medleth with his sons and daughters, as well as with his servants, and rest
of his substance taking them also to be a portion of the same. Wherefore even
in this that children are their fathers riches (as it is the common saying)
they must not bestow themselves but must be bestowed of their parents, whose
goods they are. And least any man should contemn this as a weak and childish
reason let him know, that the learned Father Theodorus Beza uses it, although
not in the same just number of words, yet in this very self same argument,
and to the self same purpose, in his book de repudijs and diuortijs, where
his judgment may be further seen to iumpe with mine fully in this question,
as mine also in this behalf agrees with the opinion of all the learned.

And it seems not to be much impertinent from this place, The fifth reason
from the vneffectualnes of vows without the consent of parents, and husbands
in their childr^ and wives.
the which we read in the book of Numbers concerning Vows, where among other
things we do find, that the vows which were made by the children without the
priuitie and consent of the fathers, and of the wives without the liking and
allowance of their husbands were altogether unlawful and of no force. And the
reason according to true meaning of the place, is given by the best
Interpreters, because neither children, nor wines are sus iur^s, that is, at
their own liberty and appointment, but under the rule and government of
others, namely of their parents and husbands. As therefore to make a vow unto
the Lord, being in it self and of it own nature an holy and acceptable action
unto God, and where with he is well pleased, is notwithstanding in children
unlawful, because it is such an action as they only may perform which are
free and at their own disposition, the which they are not: so in like manner to
consent in matrimony, although in it self it be both honest and lawful, yet
is it not an action of force in children, without the consent and allowance of
their parents, because that children are not free and at their own liberty,
but by the laws both of God and man tied and bound unto the subjection of
their fathers, as has at large been showed before, and through the whole
discourse of this treatise is to be proved also hereafter.

In the 22. The sixth reason from the laws in Exodus, of entifing of maids, and
the fathers selling their daughters for servants.
of Exodus there is a law concerning the intising of maids (a practice this day
too common, because there is not discipline sharp enough ministered to repress
it) and in the chapter before going there is another co^stitution as touching
fathers, that to relieve their own necessities are constrained to sell their
daughters for servants: by the first whereof it appears, that the contract of
children without the consent of their parents, is not auaillable, or of any
force: and by the second may easily be gathered that seruats were not at
liberty to make their own choice in marriage, but that the right thereof
appertained unto their masters, both places jointly co^cluding flatly for
me, that both children and servants as Res domenorum: that is, the goods of
their owners, are not, as in other cases of less weight, so in like sort in
that matter of great importance, namely the bestowing of themselves in
wedlock for to follow the violent stream of their own pleasing affections,
but to be ordered and guided by the rule of their fathers and masters. I will
set down the several words of the law in both these cases, that being
diligently observed and marked, fathers and masters may learn what was the
authority in the marriage of their children and servants, and that these
likewise may understand what is their part and duty in these considerations.
Exodus. 22.16.17
The words for intising of maids are these: And if a man intise a maid that
is not betrethed, and lie with her, he shall endow her and take her to wife: if
her father refuse to give her to him, he shall pay money according to the
dowry of virgins. Exodus 21.7.8.9.
Here is expreslie set down, that albeit the two parties were fully agreed,
yet is the match not to go forward, unless the father also do give his
consent. Now for the father his selling of his daughter, to redeem his own
need and poverty, thus speaks the lawgiuer in the chapter before going:
Likewise if a man sell his daughter to be a servant, she shall not gee out as
men servants do. If she please not her master, who has betrethed her unto
himself, then shall he cause to buy her, he shall have no power to sell her to
a strange people, seeing he despised or defloured her. But if he has betrothed
her unto bys senne, he shall deal with her according to the custom of the
daughters. So that ye see how the maiden in this sort sold to be a servant by
her father, became by this sale bound to the power of her master, to be at
his appointing in the case of marrying, and such was the condition of all other
servants by the law of God in this respect, and that the sons also were not
left unto their own direction, no although that they were otherwise free,
besides that this place does prove the same, directly affirming that the
father of the free son might betroth him unto his bond maid, it shall in his
place sufficiently hence forward likewise appear. The seventh reason drawn
from the commandment: Honor thy father and mother. etc.


Besides all this what clearer evidence can we have on our side, then the fifth
commandemet, in the which children are commanded to honor their fathers and
mothers, with a blessing promised to those which perform the same: whereby we
gather by the nature of contraries, that there is a curse also belonging unto
all those children that shall dishonor them. And in that God wills that the
parents by their children should be honored, he means, that they should in
all humility and modesty reverence them, with all dutiful submission, be
obedient unto them, and with all willingness show themselves thankful for their
procreation, education, sustentation, and all other benefits, that under God
they have received from them, being ready by all means they possible may,
(...), that is, to imitate and express toward them the nature of the Storke,
whose property (as they write of the^) is to provide meat, and feed their
dams, when through age they grow so old, that they are not able for to help
themselves, that is to say, they must to their very utmost seek to make them
recompense and requital of some part of those vnrequitable pains the which
their loving parents have taken with them, and make some a mends for the
vnconteruaillable kindness that they have showed toward them. But where they
bestow themselves in marriage without the consent of their parents, there they
do fault and make a breach of duty in all these three respects, that is to
say, they neither reverence, obey, nor show themselves thankful unto them. For,
reverence consists in this, that we carry toward them a certain honest and
modest shamefastnes, joined with abashfull awfulnes and standing in fear of
the^ the which works in us a conceiving of such an opinion and estimation of
them, as that we have an especial respect and regard of them in doing or not
doing of things, neither of a care to please them, or of a fear to offend
them. Obedience herein shows forth it self, in that willingly without
murmuring or grudging we be willing to be ordered, directed, guided, and ruled
by them, being ready to do all lawful things the which they command us, and
to refrain from those things the which they shall forbid us. Thankfulness
besides that, there are many other branches, is always mindful of benefits
received, and therefore carries continually a vigilant and watchful eye
toward the party by whom it has been pleasured, that no discurtesie in any
case be offered, or any occasion ministered, whereby he may conceive
unkindness. And by this familiar description of these three heads, whereof
stands chiefly the honor due unto parents, we may clearlie see, that those
which in wedding tarry not for the consent of their fathers and mothers, do
neither stand in any awful fear of them, as who^ they would be lorn to offend
or displease, nor yet give over themselves in all things to be governed and
advised by them, or have any regard that they be not causers to make their
friends or parents conceive hardly and unkindly of them, when as it is more
then manifest, that in matters concerning their duty toward their parents,
no grief cutteth nearer unto the heart then this, when they entangle
themselves contrary unto their mind and liking. And therefore such children
as match in this sort, as it were in spite of the teeth of their fathers and
mothers are neither reverent, obedient, nor thankful unto them, and so
consequently they do not honor them, whereby they incur and run into the
curse of God, the which must without true and unfeigned repentance pull down
upon the heads of themselves and their families the fearful plagues of God.
His heavy and hot indignation against them to their utter subversion, decay
and ruin, The eight reason from the place of Paul. Collos. 3.20.


S. Paul in his epistle unto the collossians, wills children to be obedient
unto their parents in all things, and gives a reason thereof saying, For that is
well pleasing unto the Lord. Out of this place I reason after this manner, to
prove that the good will of the parents must be sought for and obtained by the
children in their contracts of marriage. Whatsoever pleases God, the same ought
of al children to be practiced so far forth as it concerns their place and
calling: but to marie with the^ consent of parents is a thing that pleases
God, therefore children in their marriages ought to have the consent and
allowance of their parents. That every one in his calling ought to labor to do
that thing which pleases God, I take to be a case so clear, that no man
doubts of the same so that to go about to prove this were as needles a
thing, as to labor to prove that water is moist, fire is hot, or that it is
day at high noone. If any thing in the former reason be denied, it will be this,
that to mary with the consent of the parents pleases not God, the which
although it be as evident and apparent as the former, and cannot be denied of
any that has a forehead at al (for who, except he carry a face of brass, can
be doubtful of this, that God is well pleased with the matching of children by
the consent of their parents, provided always that the marriage be in his fear
the which caution is to be observed through out this whole controversy, either
handled already or to be touched herafter) yet for the sake of the simpler
sort, the which of ignorance for the most part offend in this kind of privy
contractes, I will make this point plain also after this manner. All obedience
unto parents is well pleasing to the Lord, but for the sons to take wives, and
the daughters to take husbands with the liking and approouing of their fathers
and mothers, is an especial obedience unto them, and such as all parents wish
even with all their heart to have in all their children performed toward them,
therefore to marie with the consent of parents is such an action wherewith God
is well pleased. The very words of Paul, where he says, Children obey your
parents in all things, do sufficiently warrant, that all obedience unto
parents is well pleasing unto God, and the same is likewise avouched by Paul
before in the epistle unto the Ephesians, where speaking of the duty of
children, he has these words, Children obey your parents in the Lord: Ephesians.
6.1.
setting down this reason, for it is right. And that fathers and mothers do
hold themselves obeyed, when their children be ruled and ordered by them in the
choice of their wives and husbands, is so evident, that no man can gainsay it.
It must therefore needs follow, that God is well pleased, when they do get
them yoakefellowes with the consent of their parents. Nay, as it is truth not
to be doubted of, that God his favor and alowance goes always with those
espousals, or betrothings the which are ratified and established with the
assent of those that bare us, and unto whom we do owe our being, because that
herein we do perform a chief point of obedience, the which God looks for,
and requires at our hands: so on the contrary, when we shall ioin our selves
in the band of matrimony, and make no reckoning of the authority of our
superiors, stepping in between, God cannot behold those bridals with a
cheerful and a smyling countenance but is displeased, and frowneth at the
same, because that we have forgotten ourselves in a principal part of our
child-like and dutiful obedience. For if we must submit our selves, and lay
down our hands under the feet of our parents in all things, yielding our
obedience in the very smallest causes, because God has so commanded, as the
Apostle fully in so many words does clearly teach us, then doubtless much more
in the case of marying (a matter of such force and importance, as whereupon for
the most part depends our making or marring) we ought willingly to put our
necks under the wholesome yoke of their fatherly power, upon whose consent or
refusal lies the establishing or disanulling of our handfasting our selves
without their agreement thereunto.

But it will here be replied, The ninth reason, together with the answering of
an objection concerning the restraint of childrens obedience.
that Paul himself in a kind of show of some contrariety, restreineth the
general obedience of children commanded in the third to the Collossians to to
be performed unto their parents in all things and draws the same into a
more straight and narrow compass in his Epistle unto the Ephesians, where he
will have their duty to be no further yielded unto them then in the Lord, and
therefore unless it may plainly be proved, that to have the consent of
parents in marriage is a thing commanded by the word of God, children are freed
and set at liberty from giving obedience thereunto. I answer, that the one
place is a good comment and exposition unto the other, so that this precept:
Children obey your parents in all things, ought worthelie to be expounded by
that other: Children obey your parente; in the Lord: that is (as I expound it,
letting go all other interpretations) in all such things as are not against
the Lord, or which in the Scriptures are commanded by the Lord. Which
interpretation I do the rather embrace, because I see it to be warranted by
the answer the which Peter and John in the Acts do make unto the chief
rulers of the Synagogue, whereby they excuse themselves for not obeying their
inhibition forbidding them to preach any more in the name of Jesus, saying,
Whether it be right in the sight of God, to obey you rather them God judge ye.
Whereby we are taught, that not only in the commandments of our parents,
but also of all other our superiors be they Kings, rulers or Magistrates of
any other condition whatsoever, all which are comprehended under the name of
parents, that if they inioine us to do any thing a against that obedience the
which we owe unto God, we are not indeed viole^tlie to resist, but we must with
patience abide such punishment as they shall lay upon us, rather then in
obeying them we should disobey God, unto whom of good right we are bound above
and before al others be they of never so high and excellent places. For there
is a double obedience, that is, a certain first, chief, and most soueraign
obedience the which is proper and belongs unto God, and a secundarie or
inferior obedience the which is due and appertaining unto men. A most
geneneraral rule the which ad mitteth no exception.
So that in all our actions what soever belongs unto this life this is a most
general rule the which admits or receives none exception: God must be
obeyed before, or rather then men. To return therefore unto the matter in
hand, the obedience of children to their parents must (I grant) be limited
and bounded within the railes and listes of our obedience peculier unto God,
that is to say, Children are no further to obey the commandments of their
parents, then so far forth as the same be answerable and agreeable unto the
commandments of God. But this never a whit relieueth their bad and
vnfollowable course the which in marriage will be their own caruers, and make
their own choice without the consent and allowing of their parents, the which,
besides that has hither to been alleged, we will yet further more largely and
more expreslie prove out of the word of God, and confirm, that so it ought to
be.

And now are we come indeed unto a more higher, and nearer point, and the which
will seem stranger both unto a great sort of parents, and also serve very
strongly to curb the unbridled and stay-les affections of an infinite number
of inconsiderate and unadvised youths (if by the warrant of the word of God
they may be stayed) when as it shall be plainly laid down unto them, that not
only they are in their handfastinges and making sure in marriage to have the
consent of their fathers and mothers, and that, not seeking for the same, they
break Gods commandment, but also when it shall be showed, that choice of
wives and husbands for them, is not in their power, but in the authority of
their fathers, and that this, both in plain words is set down in the
scriptures, and may moreover be proved by many examples as a general use and
custom to have been observed not only of the godlier sort among the Jews,
but also among the gentiles, which had no other direction but the law of
nature: When I say, it shall be evidently proved, that the choice in marriage,
of husbands and wives for their sons and daughters, was in the Parents, and
not in the children, I think there will no question at all afterward be
made, whether the consent of the parents be requisite to be had or no in the
marriage of their children, forasmuch as if it be not in the children to make
their own choice, much less may they marie without their parents liking:
Children in marriage may not make their own choice, therefore much less ought
they marie without their friends consent.
for those that of themselves may not do the lesser, cannot be said to be at
their own libetie to do the greater: but children in matters of marriage may
not do the lesser, that is, make their own choice, which is a less thing then
to marie without consent, therefore it must of necessity follow, that in
marying they must have the consent of their parents.

That children may not make their own choice in marying, I prove after this
manner: No child may take upon him the duty and office of his father: To make
choice of husbands and wives for sons and daughters in marriage, is the
duty and office of fathers: therefore children in marriage may not make their
own choice, and so consequently may not marie without the consent of their
fathers. The first, that children may not take upon the^ the office of their
fathers, I take as granted. The second, that parents ought to take wives unto
their sons, and husbands unto their daughters, I will prove by the
commandment of God in sundry places, and by manifest reason drawn from those
places. And in this point, If I bestow the more labor, I shall the rather be
borne withal, because it is the most weighty part of all this discourse,
wherein, if I shall happily, or rather unhappily, of any be deemed tedious or
ouerlong, the profitablenesse of the matter, if God give grace, that being of
ignorance in the most neglected before, it may now upon knowledge be put in
diligent practice hereafter, shall easily (I trust) procure my pardon. And my
good hope and earnest prayer also is, that this my travail shall not be in
vain, but that al godly fathers and mothers seeing clearly at the length what
charge by God himself is laid upon them, will be careful in time to make
meet choice for their children, and that all dutiful and obedient sons and
daughters understanding that it is no devise of man, but the express
commandment of God that their fathers and mothers should provide the^ wives
and husbands, will cease henceforth to take upon them the office of their
parents, and with all willingness, be content to stand in these cases to the
choice of their elders, which they shall make for the^ in the fear of the
Lord, and agreably unto his word, or at least wise in no case assure
themselves, unless themselves be sure of their consent.

Now let us see the places of Scripture, by which it may appear that the
choice of husbands for the daughters, and of wives for the sons is by the
commandment of God himself laid upon the parents, Places of scripture
proouing that parents ought to provide wives and husbands for their sons and
daughters. Deuteronomy. 7.3.
concerning which matter, in the book of Deuteronomy we read thus. Neither
shatt thou make martages with the^ (he speaks of the seven nations, the which
by the Jews were utterly to be rooted out) neither giuethy daughter unto his
son, nor take his daughter unto thy son. Here God gives an especial charge
unto al fathers among the Jewish nation, that at no hand they should place in
marriage, citheir their sons with the daughters of those nations, or take of
their sons to be husbands for their daughters, the which precept had bin in
vain, if they had not had this power and authority over their children, or if
their sons and daughters had been at their own liberty in these cases to have
made their own choice, for they might easily have replied, that their
children in these points were not to be at their command, and the children
might have complained of the hard dealing of their fathers in debarring the^
their right in making their own matches, if any such privilege had belonged
unto them: but the fathers neither taking any exception against God, to excuse
themselves from this duty, nor the sons pleading that by this law their
interest should be impeached, does argue sufficiently that it was the
ordinary course of that time for parents to give their children in marriage,
and that their children were well content with their fathers doings in this
behalf.

It will here peradventure be said, That God by making this law, brethren the
Beniamites, for their maintenance of that most horrible outrage in defiling in
very shameful and beastly manner of the Levites concubine, bound themselves
by a solemn oath, and swear, saying: None of us shall give his daghter unto the
Bentamits to wife. This oath for my part (reserving to others their contrary
judgment) I do not in any case allow, but condemn the same as rash, and
unadvised, the which truly repenting themselves of their rashness, they might
with far better conscience have broken then kept, and I could allege many
reasons to confirm mine opinion, but that is not appertaining to this present
argument, neither yet any part of my purpose in this place, nor at this time,
only I bring it to show, that hereby it is manifest that they made no doubt of
their liberty in disposing of their children in marriage, nor of their readiness
to obey them in that behalf, for if they might not ouerrule them in this
matter, or their children had bin to make their own choice, they had been
worthy of double blame, both in taking upon them the placing of their
daughters, and also in binding themselves with an oath for the due execution and
performance of that thing, The rashness of the Israli^ takes not a way their
ri^ in making choice for the in their man ages.
the which they had no right to lay upon them.

And howsoever it be that this place may be thought of some, not of force
suffiicient to warrant this authority of Parents, in making the choice for
their sons and daughters in their marriages, because the oath was taken
unadvisedly (albeit that their offending in one thing, be not plea good enough
to disfrauchize them of their freedom and liberty in an other thing) yet if
the cause had been good, it shall appear by an other place, that they might by
oath have bound themselves for the not giving of their daughters in marriage,
whereby may be gathered that the choice in these cases lay in the parents,
and not in their children: for herein they fault in this action, not that they
seek to keep their right and authority in providing for their children, but
in that they make an oath both rash, and full of cruelty against their
brethren.

Now that the choice was in parents of providing wives and husbands for their
children and in such sort, that they might in honest and godly matches bind
themselves so to do, it is certain by that which we read in the last chapter
of the book of Nehemiah, who caused many of them that were returned from the
captivity, not only to take an oath that they would not take wives unto their
sons nor husbands unto their daughters of the strange nations there
specified, but also made them to curse and ban themselves, and to wish heavy
judgments and plagues of God to fall upon them, if they should do the
contrary.

That the matter may be out of all doubt and controversy, it shall not grieve
me to set down the words as they lie in the text: Nehem. 13.23.24.
In those days also (says Nehemiah) I saw Jews that married wives of Ashdod,
of Ammon, and of Moah. And their children spoke half in the speech of Ashdod,
and could not speak in the Jews language, and according to the language of
the one people, and of the other people. Then I reproved the^, and cursed
them, and smote certain of the^, and pulled of their hair, and took an oath of
the^ by God: ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, neither shall
you take of their daughters unto your sons, nor for your selves. Whosoever
shall with him self weigh and consider of this most excellent and worthy man,
of his true godliness and zeal in religion, of his great care and forwardnes
to build up the city and Temple, of his faithfulness in his government and rule
over the people committed to his charge, he may not go about to offer unto him
this injury, insomuch as once dreaming that a man of his holiness, religion,
zeal, wisdom, and godliness would so much as make the very least motion of
any unlawful matter to his people, much less enforce the^ by oath to enter
into such a course, whereby they might easily have bin perjured had they not
in this case well known their fatherly power over their children, and been
persuaded of their tractable readiness in this matter to be ruled by them. Such
was the discipline of that time, and in such awe stood dutiful children unto
their loving fathers in those days, that being therennto required by the
magistrate, they durst not only pawn their credit, but that which more is,
give their oath, and hazard their conscience, upon the assured confidence
wheich they reposed in their childrens willingness to betake and betroth
themselves unto such yoke fellows as they should appoint and make choice of
for them in honest matrimony to lead their lives withal. Yet do I not think
the contrary, but that in those ages, like as in our time there were many both
sons and daughters, which are like unruly coltes and untamed heifars could
not be brought unto this pass, nor yet be yoked within this bow, but the
sturdie frowardnes of some certain, is no disproofe of the dutiful obedience
of the better sort, neither was there any more required of the fathers, then
that according unto God his commandment, so far as in them lay, they should
do their parts to keep their children within this compass: that is to say,
they were to provide matches for them within their own people, to charge them
in regard of that honor, the which by God his commandment they did owe unto
them, that they yielded unto their fathers choice, and having gone thus far,
they have sufficiently done that which unto them belonged, and for the rest,
they were to leave their rule less children unto the judgments of God, and
correction of the magistrate, who in cases of disobedience, where the authority
of parents could bear no sway, Deuteronomy 21, 18.
was by God himself appointed to minister correction according unto the
quality of the transgression.

To make an end of this ninth reason, in the which I may be thought to have
dwelled too long, Almost strong place our of Jeremy to prove that that the
chois was in parents to provide sit matches for their children in marriage.
I will shut up this place with an authority taken out of the prophet Jeremy,
and with the judgment of M. Calvin (a most worthy instrument of Christ his
Church in our time) upon the same, the which shall strike this matter stone
dead (as they say) and so go on to other proofs, and these shall serve as a
strong nail to fasten all the rest together, and to make sure all the other
testimonies of scripture in this foresaid ninth reason, already quoted, for the
faithful alleging of the which places, unto such end and purpose, and by the
holy Ghost they are directed, besides that, I have the testimony of a clear
conscience to bear witness of my fearful carfulness to deal sincerely
and faithfully in the handling of the word of God, If I shall be thereunto at
any time hereafter urged, I can bring also the confirmation of the best and
most learned writers.

Jeremy in the 29 chapter of his prophecy among other reasons the which he
uses to comfort the people in their long and hard captivity, Ievem. 1^.6.
and to put them in hope that they shall assuredly return, at the length
speaks unto them by the commandment of God after this manner: Take you wives,
and beget sons and daughters, and take wives for your sons, and give your
daughtes to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters, that you may be
increased there and not be diminsshed. Upon this place Calvin writes after
this manner. Whereas (says he) the prophet wills them to take wives for their
sons, and to give their daughters to be married, this is according to the
lawful order and course of nature, because that this were too preposterous, or
overthwart and topsituruy dealing, that young men and maidens, should get them
either husbands or wives at their own lust and pleasure. God therefore in
this place speaks according unto the common rule, when as he commands
young men to be linked in matrimony no otherwise, but by the commandment of
their parents: and maidens also not to marie any husbands, but such as to whom
they shall be given. Here you may see in few words confirmed that, Four
especial points to be noted out of the words of Calum.
which in so many I have at large set down before: where first it is to be
noted, that childrens marying according to the choice of their parents, is a
thing commanded by God. Secondly, that it is agreeable unto the law of nature.
Thirdly, that it was a general rule and common practice. Fourthly, that the
contrary dealing is preposterous and overthwart, and as far out of square and
order, as if the cart should be placed and set before the horse. And mark
further, that in all these places cited in this ninth reason, God says not, It
is a commandment, and not a permission, that parents in marriage should make
choice for their chils dressed.
that parents if they will, may provide wives for their sons, and husbands
for their daughters: That it were meet and requisite that it should be so, but
uses every where the imperative mood, that is, commands that it be so, and
leaves it not at random to our discretion to choose whether we will have it
to be so, or otherwise, to that end that we should know, that if we that are
parents shall neglect our duties in this behalf, we shall not pass away
with the matter slightlie and lightly, as if it were a lest and a trifle, but
that we shall answer for it, as for a transgression and breach of his
commandment.

Having therefore given this brief caveat and warning blow unto fathers and
mothers to think hereafter more advisedly upon their duties in bestowing of
their children, I take my leave and farewell of this reason, giving al young
men and maidens in like manner to understand, that if they shall henceforth
refuse to be ordered and directed by their parents, they shall be found rebels
against God, transgressors against the law of nature, breakers of the common
rule and custom of all well governed children, and such, so far as in them is,
would bring in all confusion and disorder, in altering and changing Gods own
course, to set up and establish their own unbridled lust and lawles affection.

Hitherto we have seen how farreforth the Scriptures, and places of the old
Testament, do stand firmly on our side, for the proof of this question, the
which we have taken upon us, namely that marriages are not to be made without
the consent of parents, the which as we persuade our selves, we have proved
with the a du^intage, she wing that not only children, in marriage ought to
have the good will and leave of their fathers and mothers, butalso, if we snal
look more neerlie into the cause, that the choice in marriage belong unto them
Now in ^he tenth place I will make this plain also, by one clear testimony and
witness out of the new Testament, the which I take from out of the seventh
Chapter of the first Epistle of S. Paul unto the Corinthians, whose words be
these: The tenth reason out of the words of Paul. 1. Cor. 7.36.37.38.
But if any man think that it is uncomely for his vingin, if she pass the
flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, resin^eth
not, let them be married. Nevertheless he that stands firm in his heart, that
he has no need, but has power over his own will, and has so decreede in
his heart, that he will keep his virgin, he does well. So then he that grueth
her to martage, does well, but he that gives her not to marriage does better.
The purpose of Paul in this place is to give counsel unto patentes, what course
they were best to take for their children concerning their bestowing of them in
marriage, or letting them remain single, according unto the assured and
certain knowledge that they have of their ability to live chaste, or their
need, otherwise to use that lawful remedy, the which God has ordained
against fornication, which is to marie, so that those which have the gift of
chastity, he would not have constrained to join themselves in wedlock, nor
those which are not able to be forced to live single. This is briefly the
sum of the place. Concerning those children that cannot live single, he
wills their parents to look unto them betimes, least that their too long
differring and delaying the matter breed some inconvenience. And this is it
that he says: If ante man think that it is uncomely for his virgin, if
she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he
will, he sins not: Let them marie. Which last clause plainly teaches, that
look what is said of the daughter, is to be understood also of the son: for
one cannot be married alone. Speaking therefore in the plural number, he
means as well the sons as the daughters, touching whom this is his
counsel: That parente^ when their children come once to such years, that
they are ready to marie, The sum o^ the Apostle ^^ his counsai^ unto paren^^
in time to p^^uide fit ma^^ches for the children.
should in due time have consideration hereof, not giving occasion, by causing
them stay too long, either to be derided, or laughed to scorn as stale
bachelors, or otherwise to be suspected of bad husbandry, or huswifrie, or of
pride and disdaining all others, being so nice and coy, that they think none
fine enough to match withal, or that there is in them some secret and hidden
vice or infirmity the which makes them unfit for marriage, or otherwise of
covetousness, because they are loath to depart with money toward their
maintenance, protracting and delaying the time longer then the nature and
disposition of their sons and daughters will bear, so that by their means
being thus deferred and put off, when as they are not able any longer to
forbear, their parents neglecting to provide that remedy for them the which
Go^ has ordained, they burn in lust and commit folly. Their fathers and
mothers therefore perceiving that so it ought to be, that is, their children
without fear of some inconuemence cannot tarry any longer vnmatied, ought
worthelie to have this wise care for them, in time to provide them of fit and
honest matches. This then is the drist of this place, that parents should by
all gentle and fair means true out and search the state and disposition of
their children toward marriage when by reason of convenient age they are fit
for the some, and by conference and questioning with them, get from them how
they stand affected this way, and accordingly as they shall have sure notice
how they are given, to suffer them either to remain single, or else that they
(as it is their fatherly duty) do provide for them godly wives and
husbands. The inconvenience that grows by this that parents follow not
Paul his counsel in providing fit matches for their children
Thus we see how pregnant and plentiful a text this is to teach that it lies
in the parents to make due choice for their children in the case of matrimony:
And because that small regard is had hereof in many now adays, hence it
comes that some children give themselves over unto the lusts of the flesh,
in committing shameful and filthy fornication: others, contrary unto the laws
both of God and nature, break into the duties of their fathers, and
unnaturally, and not child-like, without the priuitie and consent of their
parents make their own matches and the same for the most part so untoward,
that they bring the gray hairs of their parents unto their grief and sorrow
to the grave, and themselves besides wastfully spending all that they have,
live all their life long in continual and daily home braules, and household
strifes and discordes.

You therefore that be fathers and mothers I most earnestly and heartily
exhort and beseech you for the love of God and in the tender bowels and mercy
of Jesus Christ our most gracious redeemer, An exhortation unto al parents.
that you will at the length awake, and rouse up your selves out of this
deadly sleep of carelessness, wherewith you have been long oppressed, making
little or none accountes at all of this weighty and necessary duty of
providing virtuous wives and husbands for your sons and daughters, delay the
time henceforth no longer, put in diligent ure and practice this wholesome
counsel of the Apostle, lay off all rigorous austerenes and bitterness, and in
the spirit of lenity and mildness, question and confer, talk and reason
with your sons and daughters, when they be come unto ripe veares, that you
may learn how they are inclined concerning marriage, or sole life: and if it be
so that you think, that through bashfulnesse and shamefastness they will not
dare to deal plainly with you, nor freely to unfold their minds unto you
as they would do unto some of their familiars, let it not grieve you to use
this wise policy to fish out their purpose by some of their friends unto
whom being great with them, they will not be affraide to utter the very
bottom of their hearts and inmost secrets. And when you shall have found,
that it is safest for your honor, and meetest for their present estate, that
you provide for the^ to marie, go about the same in the fear of God
accordingly, with faithful and earnest prayer unto God, Genesis 24.12.
after the example of the godly Steward of Abraham in the book of Genesis, that
he will both direct you in a virtuous and christian choice, and also incline and
move the hearts of your children with all dutiful readiness to stand unto the
same, And taking the matter in hand after this reverent and christian order,
assure your selves that you have performed a good work, and sin not, for so
Paul tells you in plain words, where he says, Let him do what he will,
he sins not. and a little after, He that gives her to marie, (meaning when
the father by good trial had found out that otherwise she cannot live chaste)
sins not. For in speaking after this manner, he has (no doubt) respect unto
that course, the which the Lord himself in his word has set down, and the
which also has of the godly been practiced even from the beginning, as by
many examples anon shall be showed. There is therefore no danger of doing
amiss, and of sinning, if that you behave your selves after this sort in
providing husbands for your daughters, and in bestowing of your sons in
honest wedlock. But rather on the contrary part you shall very greatly
transgress and offend, if ye shall neglect and forslowe your duty in this
behalf.

And to all you that will be counted godly and dutiful children, An earnest
suit unto all godly childs^
let me in all humble and loving manner make this earnest suite and weighty
motion, that you likewise hereafter will with all reverence and aduisednesse
consider, what duty you owe unto God, whose order this is, that you should be
ruled by your parents in all things, unto whom he has given such high and
sovereign power and authority over you, that he will have even those solemn
vows and promises that you have made unto himself to stoup and give place
unto their consent and alowance strive no longer against God, Number. 30.
but in all willingness of mind put your necks under his yoke: enter not
violently into your fathers right: give unto them this honor, to think that
they by their wise donie can, and for the loving care the which they bear
toward you, will provide better for you, then you can do for your selves:
remember that you are called after Christ by the glorious name of Christians,
who was obedient unto his father even unto the death of the cross, let it
therefore be no grief unto you to submit your selves unto them in that same
thing, whereof you have in the scriptures so many notable and honorable
presidentes: if they shall be thought slack in providing for them in due time,
labor by all modest means that by some friends they be put in mind of their
duty: since God has commanded them to make choice for you, bestow not your
selves without their consent but humble your selves by devout and faithful
prayers before the throne of the almighty, that he in mercy will vouchsafe
that your natural parents unto whose power you are subject, setting aside all
carnal and earthly respects, may in their choice for you have his fear
before their cies, and that your selves may not be carried away after your own
fancies, but by the working of his holy spirit be inwardly and thoroughly
moved with a godly, christian, and pure love to embrace those which they
shall have chosen and provided for you, as the godly children in former ages
have done before you.

And here I will allege, The eleventh reason from the common use and practice
of the godly in former times.
for an other reason the general use and practice of the godly Fathers,
Patriarchs and other holy men in providing of wives for their sons, and
husbands for their daughters, together with the willing obedience of their
children to accept and take them so provided, at their hands, to serve to
prove that it was a common law among those that lived in those times: for the
sons and daughters in matrimonicall cases to be ordered and ruled by their
fathers and mothers. For the Lawyers do hold, that general use and custom
do make a law. And what reason then is there to the contrary, but that this,
the which has so generally and continually been observed, should in like
manner go and be taken for a law, the which it may be thought that God even
hereby would induce and lead men unto, in that, when he first created all
things, and man last of all, over whom by the privileges of creation, he might
worthily claim the right and power of a father, he does not suffer him at his
own choice and pleasure to take unto himself the woman, made of his side, but
brought her himself unto him to be his wife, by which his fact (as I do take
it) was notably prefigured or foreshadowed out unto us, God as a father
provides a wife for Adam in Paradise.
that he would have earthly fathers take that course in providing for their
children in marriage, the which he being our heavenly father took for his
eldest son Adam in paradise, that is, that they should make choice of wives and
husbands for their sons and daughters, the which they ought as willingly to
receive at the hands of their fathers, as Adam did his wife from the hand of
God. If any of those vnbribeled colts, the which think they may at their own
pleasure make their own matches, shall for the defense and maintenance of their
disorder, dealing in this behalf reply and say, that this example taken from
the fact of God, does no more warrant this course, the which so much disliketh
them, A trifling ca^ill.
then it proves, that a father ought in like sort to take a wife for his
son out of the rib of a man, and close up the place again with flesh, as God
did in Adam: I answer that this is a frivolous or trifling cavil. For, as the
making of Heuah of the rib of Adam, was inimitable, or vnfolowable, being a
token of God his omnipotency and almighty power: so the other, being such as
both without danger we may follow, and also (as has been plentifully before
showed) we are commanded to follow, and now remains to make plain, that
the godly from time to time did follow, might very well be a foretoken unto
us, that God in the choice for our children would have that we should do the
like.

And this seems yet further hereby to be confirmed, God gives Christ his son
to be the husband of his Church.
that when as our first parents through their disobedience and breach of God
his commandment had worthelie deferued to be turned headlong out of the
earthly paradise, and had further through this their trasgession, lost so
far as in them lay the in heritance of the kingdom of heaven, both for
themselves and also for all their posterity, when as now there remained no
other way of recovering the same again, but only by the means of a marriage
to be made by faith between himself and his posterity, and our Lord and
Savior Jesus Christ, the true and ever lasting son of God: who knows not
that this match before all times was concluded in the eternal and most wise
counsel of God the father, who gave his only son Jesus Christ in time to
be borne of the virgin Marie, that he should not only be the spouse and
husband of his Church, the members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
bones, Ephesians. 5 3^.
as the Apostle speaks unto the Ephesians, but also of his entire and tender
love unto the same laid down his life for it, that it being washed in his own
blood, wherewith it is all to be sprinkled by the hand of faith, it may be
presented as a pure virgin unto his heavenly father without spot or wrinkle.
if therefore God the father made the choice of us his church to be a wife for
Jesus Christ his son, who with unspeakable willingesse took the same at his
hand, although sin greatly blemished and deformed, which blemishes and
deformities he covered notwithstanding by faith in his blood: How much more
then ought earthly fathers seek out meet wives and husbands for their sons
and daughters, whose duties it is to accept and like of the^ after this sort
provided and chose^ for the^

But if any shall think these examples to be far fetched (albeit they be used of
men of great note in this se fe same very argument) I will now come unto other
presidents, Peter Martyr in his comme^taries upon the book of Judges.
so many as I can call to my remembrance, as I read them set down in the
book of the scriptures.

Abraham being very old and stricken in years, intending to make choice of a
wife for Isaac his son, Abraham by his steward prou^deth a wife for Isaac his
son.
who at this time was no child of himself, but forty years of age, without
imparting his counsel unto him, commits this chardge unto the Stewardes of
his house, of whom he takes an oath for his faithful dealing in this
business, whereas, had it either been the custom of that time, or otherwise
law full for children in these cases to have chosen for themselves at their
own will and pleasure, it had been most meet and convenient that his father
should have dealt with Isaac his son, and not with his servant concerning.

The servant, as it may appear by his proceedings, The Steward goes unto the
father of Rebeccha.
being well acquainted with the practice of those days, deals not at all with
Rebeccha in these affairs, but goes directly unto her father Bethuell, at
whose hands he does obtain her for his masters son. Bethuel the father,
Bethuel makes the match for his daughter.
at the Steward his propounding his suit in the name of his master, by and by
(as one not doubtful of the obedience of his daughter) concludes and shuts
up the match, yet like a kind father not minding to force his child thereunto
against her will, calls for her, and asks what she says thereunto, who like
a most loving child, does willingly consent unto her his match, and takes
her journey to go with the servant. Isaac, after that Rebecca is brought home
unto him, Rebeccha stands to the choice o her father.
enters not into the desperate vain of the unruly youths of our days, the
which are carried away with the violent stream of their headstrong affections,
and therefore they shame not to blunder out these or such like most vnreuerent
and unbefitting speeches: My father, shall my father provide me my wife? is he
to make my choice? I am to marie for my self, and not for my father, and
therefore I will be my own chooser: Like she me, I seek no further, dislike
father or mother, or all the world besides, I weigh it not etc. you shall hear
no such thing of Isaac. Nay he may worthily be a mirror or looking glass for
all sons to pry into, and to behold how far they come short from his
submisse and dutiful obedience in this behalf, Isaac takes Rebecca provided
for him, and loneth her.

yet the Scriptures mention, that he desired his parents to procure her for him
to be his wife. Where I would have it of all youths to be well noted, after
what sort he sped, with this his match of his own making. But what shall I
need to make any longer stay in bringing forth examples of the godly to
prove this custom of fathers in prouidinge marriage for their children, when
as we have testimony of the practice of the same even among the wicked, and
that out of the Scriptures also. Wicked parents have provided marriages for
their children and they have dutifully admitted of their choice.
For Hagar albeit that she her self sometimes had been a stubborn and
disobedient servant unto her mistres Sarah, yet when Ishmael her son was once
grown to man his estate, she provides and takes a wife for him out of the
land of Fgypt. And we do not read the contrary, Genesis 21. Gen 14
but that he willingly does take her at his mothers choosing, albeit that
otherwise he were a fierce and cruel man, whose hands was against every man,
and every man's hand against him. Shechem the son of Hamor a Lord of the
Hiuites, Shechem. Genesis 34.
having defloured Dinah the daughter of Iaacob, desires his father to get her
of Iaacob to be his wife, which proves that he both thought, that she was
not to be placed in marriage, but by the appointment and allowance of her
father, and that also he would not marry her but by consent and procurement of
his father Hamor. And it is more then probable or likely, that this custom of
the parents choosing, and the childrens standing to their choice, was continued
from that age, upward unto the latter times of the Poets, and Comedy and
Tragedy writers, in the generation of the Heathen and ungodly, where household
discipline and government, was not altogether shaken and decayed, in so much
that the maid says in Euripides, when she was sued unto for marriage: The maid
in Euripides.
My father will have care of my marriage, it is not in my part to determine
these matters. And agreably herunto reports Xenophon of king Cyrus, that
being solicited and motioned unto a great and honorable marriage, he answers,
K. Cyrus.
that were her personage never so honorable and her dowry to the purse never
so profitable, he will not at any hand meddle in this matter, because that it
was a thing beyond his reach, and belonged altogether unto the power and
arbitrament of his parents. And this is a matter so common and well known, that
the very boys in the Grammar school, are well acquainted therewithal out of
the Comedies of Terence, and Plautus, who among the rest make this case most
plain, that it was an ordinary course in their times, that the fathers made
the matches for their sons and daughters in the way of marriage.

Hereunto agrees all antiquity, together with the better sort of writers in
all kind of faculties, Divines, School men, Ciuilians, Canonistes, The twelf
reason from the consent of all ages, and the better sort of all kind of
writers.
Decrees, Counsels, yea and some of the Popes themselves, who have gone so
far in these matters, that they do strike with the fiery thunderbolt of
excommunication, ipso fac^to, or so soon as the deed is done (as they say) not
only all those children the which without the consent of their parents, make
these secret contractes and privy matches, but also all such as any way with
their countenance, counsel, assistance, presence, or any other means shall
help, favor, further or procure the same, yea some other of them (as the
learned well know) do hold such kind of bargains for no marriages, but
pronounce them adulteries, fornicatio^s, and whordomes. The Ciuilians stand so
stoutelie, and lustelye, to maintain the parents authority and liberty in
these cases, that this is set down among the^ for a ruled case, (as Peter
martyr reports) that if a woman have once married with an husband by the
consent of her parents, and afterward they fall at such far, that they be
divorced, if she be by persuasion moved to be reconciled unto the same
party, and be again married unto him, that this marriage being made without
the consent and knowledge of her parents, is altogether frustrate, and
unlawful, nay if any children have such parents, as be taken with Frenzy or
madness, so that they cannot have their consent in marriage, they will have them
in such a case, to obtayn the consent of their ouerseeres and governors: so
sincerely and soundly, and agreeable unto the word of God, do the civil
constitutions determine of the parents right, in the placing and bestowing of
their children in matrimonye and wedlock. The plain and clear judgment of
the best Divines of our time, touching this matter.


And that it yet may be further apparent unto al men, that I am not singular in
mine own conceit, or wedded unto any priuatiudgment in this argument, I will
add a few testimonies of the latter Divines of our age, the which tell a round
tale in this business, and go not behind the door for the matter at all, but
deliver their verdicts franklye and freely without all obscurity or darkness.
And this I will the rather do, that all parents and children, which are not
utterly void of al feeling, having of ignorance hitherto forflowed their
duties on both sides in this respect, may he^ceforth, being compassed about
with such a cloud of irrefregable or vngainsaiable witnesses, which are above
all exception against, be touched with a due and christian sorowfulnes of
conscience, the beginning of healthful repentance, so that they may think
ernestly upon the amendme^t of this great fault, the one carefully providing
christian matches for their children in due time, and the other in all dutiful
humility, framing the^ selves to accept of their choice, least that being
pressed with such a heavy weight of so many grave authorities from the law of
nature God, and nations, there be left no color of excuse unto them in that
most terrible and fearful day of reckoning, when the thoughts of our hearts
shall either accuse us, or excuse us, Romans 2.15.16
when as the Lotde him self shall judge of the secrets of men, according unto
the Gospel by lesus Christ, so that it will be then in vain for any to make
the plea of ignorance, when as besides the testimonye of his own conscience,
he shall be convinced by such a multitude of most forcible and mighty evidence,
which at the bar will stand and plead against him. But to the witnesses of
the new writers. Caluyn 1.


Calvin upon the 3 verse of the 24. chapter of Genesis, among other things
has these words: Now this ensample ought to stand us in stead of a general
rule, that children may not contract themselves in marriage, but by the
arbitrament and appointment of their parents. And truly this does the equity
of nature teach us, that children in a matter of such weight ought to rest upon
the will and pleasure of their parents: by how much the barbarousnesse of the
Pope is the more to be detested, which has dared to break in sunder this
holy band, wherefore the wanton malepertnesse and sauciness of youth is to
be restrained, that they rashly post not unto marriage without the counsel of
their fathers,

And again in another place speaking of Hagars providing a wife for her son
Ishmaell: Whereas Hagar is said (says Calvin) to have taken a wife for her
son, Genesis 21. verse. 27.
this appertains unto politic or civil government. For when as marriage is
an especial part of the life of man, it is meet that in making of the same,
children should be ruled by their parents, and follow their advise in this
behalf. This order, the which nature prescribes and teaches, we see to have
been kept of Ishmaell a wild man in the barbarousnesse of the wilderness, that
in the marieng of a wife he was obedient unto his mother. Whereof we do
perceive how cruel a monster the Pope has been, in that he has aduen tured
to break this holy law of nature. Furthermore his shamelessness was added
hereunto, in that he has vaunted that he gives a privilege unto the ungodly
contempt of parents, for the honor of holy wedlock.

Musculus upon the same place writes thus: Behold the honesty of those times.
In our days there is no need for parents to provide their sons of wives,
Musculus against stolen marriages.
when as youths is suffered by a most bad custom, to take unto themselves
wives without the priuitie of their parents, and such marriages are confirmed
in the Popes consistories, as they term them. And a little afterward: They

And because that Musculus does refer the Reader, unto that which he has
further written upon these words of Genesis, concerning this matter. And he
brought her unto him. etc. Because that this book is in latin as the rest of
his works, for the most part are, and for that every one understands not
this tongue, it shall not grieve me in this consideration for the better
satisfiyng of the godly Reader to turn that place unto English, where he
writes after this manner.

Here is to be noted, that God not only created the woman, That God himself
brings the woman unto the man, betrotheth her, and ioineth her in marriage
unto him.
but also brought her unto Ada^ to espouse and betroth her unto him, and
delivered her and joined her unto him for his wife. She was made not only of
the flesh and bones of Ada^ but also concerning kind, like unto him in all
thingss, as well as one beast is like unto another beast of his kind. Adam
might have found her out without any great pain, and when he had found her,
because of her conformity or likeness unto him, though differing indeed in
sex, yet acknowledge her agreeable unto him in all other points, ioyn her unto
him, and use her for the increasing of mankind, like as we see this to have
been done by the beasts, unto none of the which we do read, that this femal
was brought seueraly. But god would not that either Ada^, or the woman should
do any of these things, upon their own heads. Wherefore he himself joined them
together, and brought the woman unto Adam, delivered and betrothed her being
formed, and made for lawful company sake. We are admonished by this
consideration, what lawefull marriage does require, namely that the male and
female or man and woman do not join themselves together upon their ownt
rashness and lust, but that they must be lawfully joined together according
unto the ordinance of God by the advice and will of their parents and elders,
whose parts in the ioining together of Adam and Euah God too^ upon himself.
Such as are in this sort joined are joined by God himself, whose part and
office the parents and elders do rightly and lawfully supply, God supplied
the part of alders and parents, when as he joined ^u ^h^nto Adam.
after the first ordinance ^ marriage under whose power and authorit^ those that
be joined are. And in such marriage that saying of Christ has place. Whom God
has joined together, let no man put a sunder. Those that are joined together
by bad practices, by the wicked provocation of lust, in respect of wealth, and
so forth, without the ordinance of God cannot glory of lawful ioining
together. It is further required, that we be not joined after the manner of
beasts, as she by and by be mine, which having the shape of a woman pleases
my lust, but the I take her to wife, the which is brought unto me and delivered
by the Lord, and that I may say of her: The woman which thou gave me o God,
as in Chapter following we read to have been done by Adam. Therefore against
this order are fornicators, whore masters, keepers of Concubines, Which no
wise stealer can do.
and as many as cannot with a good conscience glory, that they have their
wives lawfully gotten.

Peter Martyr in his commentary upon Genesis, Peter Marter upon Genesis Cap.
24. ver. 58.
speaking of the betrothing and making sure of Rebeccah unto Isaac, writes
thus of the solemnities of that marriage: The ornaments of this marriage were
prayers, thanksgiving, hospitality, the consent of the maiden. For she is not
constrained, as it is often done by ungodly parents, who sometimes violently
force husbands upon their daughters, or that which is worse, do thrust them
into Monasteries or Abbeies. Nay above all things the consent of the parents
does here step in between, whose office it is to bestow their sons or
daughters in marriage, neither is it their parts rashly to choose unto
themselves wives etc. For I cite him the more sparingly, because he has
written a learned common place of this argument, the which, although it be in
english, yet because (so far as I know) it is not to be had severally, but
among the rest of his common places, being a book of too great a price for the
poorer sort, I have been the rather induced and moved to labor also in this
question, and that (as I trust) not without some profit unto the godly
disposed, the which shall vouchsafe to read the same.

Marlorat after he had said somewhat concerning the choice of a wife, Marlorat.
the which Hagar made for her son, at the last infers thus: Wherefore this
youth (speaking of Ishmaell) being a man grown marries a wife, but not but by
the counsel and authority of his mother, and within a little space after:
What then ought the children of the faithful to perform unto their parents?
Does it not beseme and become them in making of marriage, to be led by the power
and authority of their parents, that they give not over themselves unto their
own lusts.

Ferus a popish friar.
To like purpose has Ferus a Popish friar, noted upon Abraham his pronouncing
of a wife for Isaac by his Steward. These be his words: Note and mark, that
Isaac seeks not a wife, but Abraham provides him of a wife. For this is the
duty of parents, and belongs not properly unto the sons, whose part it is
to obey.

Which thing Orestes in Euripides allows saying: And I will praise marriage,

Bullinger. 1. Cor. 7 36.
Bullinger expounding these words of S. Paul in his Epistle unto the
Corinthians: But if he think it unseemly for his virgin etc. writes on this
sort: He declares by examples that, which he has said already, that there
should be no darkness in his words. And we may expound that word Virgin as well
for the person, as for the thing it self, namely virginity. The meaning is
this, if a man have a virgin marriable, and now ready for a husband (for this
I understand by that which he says, if she pass the time of marriage, the
which Ambrose translateth, if she be past ripenes of age) and has a desire to
mary (that is it which he says, and so it ought to be) so that her father is
to fear, least that secretly she go about, or enterprise some thing that is
not comely, unless she be provided for by marriage, now the father sins not,
if he bestow her forth upon an husband, etc. And afterward: we learn by this
discourse that it is the duty of parents, to give their daughters in marriage.
For among them of old times, the contract of matrimony was not of any force,
Marriage contractes void, without the co^s. nt of parents.
without the authority of the parents. Whereunto that in the law of God seems
to appertayn, the which is commanded unto the Jews, that they should not give
their daughters or their sons unto the Heathen in marriage: the which should
have bin in vain, if the children had been at their own liberty, and did not
rather depend upon the authority of their parents: yet this also must be added,
that it is the part of parents in time convenient to take order and provide for
their children, and that they compel them not either to virginity or single
life, or unto marriage.

Gualter is just of the same judgment upon the very same place, whose words
are: C^aiter.
But here with all, sons and daughters must mark that by this place the power
of parents over their children is established, the which as it is great in
other matters, so here in especial has it sovereign authority, whereas the
question is concerning marriage. For if they must provide for their children, in
like manner it is their part to obey them, least that by their lust and
headstrong boldness they do prevent the advice and pleasure of their
parents For always ought the law of God to bear sway with them, in the
which they are commanded to have their parents in price and honor. Number. 30.
And how great their authority is over their sons and daughters it is
manifest even by this, that their parents may disanull and break the vows
which their children have made without their knowledge and priuitie. When as
therefore GOD himself vouchsafes to yield of his own right, (that I may so
speak) and will not have that ratified and stand, the which is promised unto
himself, if the parents determine otherwise, they doubtless are to be
thought to be too rash and wicked, who will not submit their youthful desires
unto the ordering and disposing of their parents. Neither may this go for
current, that any should pretend age for his excuse. For there is no age the
which ought to break the authority of parents established by the laws of
nature. And Paul in this place speaks of virgins, the which have now
already passed the flower of their age, and marriage years, and nevertheless
subiecteth them also unto the government of their parents, when as he teaches,
not what they ought to do, but what their parents ought to dispose of them.
The civil laws.
This in times past did the makers of the civil laws deserve, the which would
have those ma riages to be void, the which are made without the advice and
consent of parents, unless some weighty case do will them to be ratified and
stand in force.

Agreeable unto this also does Hemingius set down his judgment upon this
place but in fewer words thus: Hemingius.
Now he turns his speech unto parents having daughters of grown years,
unto whom he gives authority to bestow their daughters in marriage if they
will. But that which he puts in between (and so it ought to be) is a
restraint, and it is to be understood thus; If the maiden be without the gift
of chastity it ought so to be: namely that she be given to be married, to
avoid fornication. On the other side if a virgin have the gift of chastity,
it is left free unto the parents to marie them, and not to marie them. From
hence let parents learn, that it is not lawful for them, to lay upon their
children a perpetual law of chastity, unless they be first sure that they
have the gift of chastity, the which very seldom falls out, unless by some
grief or defect and want in nature. Beza de repudiis and diuor^lis.


Beza in this case is so sure on our side, that he holds not only the stolen
contracts to be void and unlawful, but also the marriage it self that
follows after the same to be of no force and unlawful But it is best to
hear him tell his own tale himself. But what (says he) if marriage in deed
have followed after such co^rracts? Doubtless if the cause be considered why
such contracts are utterly void (be cause he namlie cannot consent to the
bestowing of himself, the which is not in his own power) it will follow that
the marriage it self ought much less to be of force, as verily wherein there
is required a more express and sure consent.

And Aretius in his common place of marriage among other things that make the
same unlawful rekoneth up the contracting of the same without the consent of
parents. Aretius
His words be these: That marriage is unlawful, the which is against the
commandment and law of God. And this faulteth either in the degrees
forbidden: or else because it is made up with privy and stolen contractes
against the will of the parents: or else when as many wives are admitted or
taken at one time.

But we will conclude and shut up this point with the testimony of M. Luther,
Luther.
the thunderbolt of Germany, whom we have reserved unto this last place. not
for that he is the least among my witnesses, who worthily ought to be
accounted off even with the very foremost for his most profitable service done
unto the Church of GOD, but because he does very evidently and clearelie
with great courage and boldness of heart set down his judgment in this cause
writing upon the 24. Chapter of the book of Genesis: Therefore (says he)
do I handle this place, albeit odious or hateful: Because Isaac does not
marie a wife, where he pleases, but is forbidden of his father to marie one
of the land of Canaan, The mischiefs the which do grow or ^riuy contracts.
and his father himself does carefully provide his son of a wife, and his
son with all willingness does obey his father. For daily experience does
teach, that those privy and stolen contractes are the cause of great
mischiefs, daily braules, strifes, periuries, and murders, and also the most
shameful plague and garboile of the Church and common wealth. So the popish
Canonists do nothing else but seek to tear in sunder the Church and trouble the
world because of their doltish and unlearned Cannons. And shall we suffer them
to bring in so many mischiefs into our Churches? Let the Devil wink at this,
and no other man: nay rather I my self will excommunicate all those doctors,
then that we will to lerate and bear in our Churches their wicked and ungodly
sentences and judgment.

And some pretty space after, he has these words: The doctrine therefore of
this place is, that parents ought to provide their sons and daughters of
honest marriage: When parents do abuse their authorltie.
Although this be not to be let pass, that it often times falls out in man's
life, that the parents do sometimes abuse their power and authority, and will
compel their children to marie with those, whom they love not, the which
comes often to pass in the great families of noble men. They are to be found
fault withal, because they carry no spark of a fatherly mind and affection,
but are blocks and stocks, they have not that same natural love toward their
children. In such a case let the Pastor of the Church, or the civil magistrate
set in their authority Because that this is not a fatherly power, but a
tyranny. We therefore do so diligently urge the authority of parents, first
because of the commandment and ordinance of God, the examples of the
scriptures, and the civil laws. Secondly because of that no table wickedness
being unto al godly and honest parents very grievous, the which has raunged
in the world in all ages: namely that when as they have brought up their
children godly and honestly, that they might be heirs of their fathers
goods, after wards there have been some found they not knowing of it and
against their wills, The common ^^actise anongSt us at his day.
the which by disceit and subtilty have ouer-recht and compassed the maidens
and honest young men, that they should by stealth marie with those, the which
were both of small honesty and also unfit for them, and unto their parents
most unwelcome.

The Pope has set open a window and a broad gate unto these horrible offenses,
The Pope glueth leave to steal away children from their parents.
and has made a way for baudes, that they might steal away men's sons and
daughters for me, for thee, for every one of us. Shall we think these
things to be suffered, or defended? But they say that men must look
diligently unto the keeping of their children, and have an especial care of
them: But how can this be inso great wickedness and untowardness of men? How
easily are the plain and simple meaning minds corrupted, and beguiled?

Let parents therefore remember that power and authority is given them from God
to bestow their children in marriage: Contractes uoid without the consent of
parents.
and that contractes made without their consent are not good, neither by the
law of God nor man.

Furthermore let children know that they are to ask their advise and to know
their pleasure. Let not a young man, A grave co^^ sell unto al^ honest your^
whose age is fit for marriage, be afraid to open his mind unto his parents:
that he is in love with an honest maiden, and desire, that they will give her
him to wife. For albeit this seem to be a token of lust scarce comely, yet
let them know that God his mercy does cover the same in marriage, and has given
a remedy for this disease. Let them therefore humble themselves before their
parents, and plainly and freely say unto them: my dear father, my good
mother, give me such a young man, or such a maiden, whom I love. And if she be
worthy to be matched with thee, or worthy of thine affinity, or thy parents,
thine honest parents will not deny thee, albeit the dowry or wealth be not
answerable. Such marriages cannot choose but be happy and prosperous, God does
co uer and beautify lust with nest marriage.
and God of his infinite goodness does bless, pardon, and cover the heat of
lust as it were with the cover of marriage. Yea, more over the holy scripture
does allow, and allege for example the love and speech of the bridegroom
and bride. Thus God pardonneth the filthiness, and miserable lust, wherein we
are borne, and that which more is, does beautify and honest the same with
lawful marriage. But let young men take heed and beware of this usual
stubbornness and contempt of parents, wherewithal some run stark mad, and
of a blind ^age do contract dishonest marriages, unfitting both themselves and
also their elders and parents. For in this place the holy scripture sets
forth a contrary example, and far more honest, to be followed, when as Isaac
marieth Rebeccah, according unto the mind, will and counsel, of his father.

These things thus considered, and this matter so generally agreed upon, and
confirmed also by the approbation and consent of so many grave, godly, and
learned witnesses, if hen ceforward the parents shall either of negligence or
sluggishnesse leave of their duty in providing of honest matches for their
children, or their sons and daughters contemptuously and stubbornlie refuse
to stand unto their godly and christian choice, ignorance will no longer serve
to excuse the fault on either side, but that it must needs follow, that the
servant that knows his masters will, and does it not, A necessatie advise
unto parents.
the same shall be beaten with many stripes. Let fathers therefore on whom the
charge by God his commandment lies to take wives for their sons, and to
provide husbands for their daughters, take dilligent heed herunto, that they
abuse not this their power and authority over their children, but as in other
cases, they are willed by the Apostle that they deal not in such sort toward
them, that they hereby be dismayed and discouraged, so especially in this
matter of greatest moment and valor of all other worldelie things whatsoever,
let them abstain from all rigor and roughness, Colos. 3.22.
and beware that they turn not their fatherly jurisdiction and government
into a tyranmcall sowernesse and way wardnesse, letting their will go for a
law and their pleasure for a reason, according unto that old, but both Tiger
and Tirant like saying: Look what I command, that will I have, my will
stands for a reason. For the rule of the parents over their children, ought
to resemble the government of good princes toward their subjects, that is to
say, it must be mild, gentle, and easy to be borne, for as they, so like wise
parents so far as concerns them and lies in their ability to perform, they
must carry such an even and upright hand in their government, T^^lie in the
second book of office.
that they may by love seek to win the hearts of those over whom they are
set, to be firm and sure to wards them, and not to keep them under awe and
subjection by fear. For, whom men fear, they hate, and him whom they hate,
his death they wish. I speak of servile or slauishe fear, not of that
child-like and reverent fear, the which both the subjects owe unto their
Princes, and the children unto their parents, and the which both the one and
the other easily obtain at the hands of such as are under their government,
by their equal, upright and moderate behavior toward them.

It does therefore stand parents greatly in hand, Parents ought to deal
sincerely in the choife for their children
that in making choice for their children they be free from all sinister and
corrupt affection, and that for lucre and covetousness they seek not to thrust
such matches upon their children, as they cannot brook, nor like well off: for
now adays in the choice that a great many parents make of husbands for
their daughters, and wives for their sons, Et genus and forma^ Regina pecunia
donat: that is, if they be rich enough, they be both fair, well favored, yea
and also godly and virtuous enough: they being far swarued from the mind and
judgment of that father, who once said concerning the marriage of his daughter,
that he had rather have a man without money, then money without a man:
signifieng hereby that he rather respected the good qualities and virtues of
his mind, then the great wealth and riches of his cofers. Fathers therefore as
they are by good right to choose, so ought they not in truth to constrain and
compel For of al other matters, the consent of the children in marriage ought to
be most free, so that in these cases, after all honest and lawful persuasions
used, look in what party the fault may be worthelie thought to rest, there
the godly magistrate ought to put in his foot, The godly magistrate.
who in some respects is not only in the scriptures comprehended under the
name of a father, but also by his sovereign au^thoritie wherewithal he is
armed from God himself, is to rule both the father and all his children, and
all other, that do belong unto him. I am not able, neither is it my purpose to
reckon all the colorable pretenses that fathers which are worldly minded can
allege to enforce upon their children what yokefellowes soever they have
procured and provided for them, so that they be rich enough: neither yet is it
possible for me to set down all the shifts, that children have to shake off
the yoke of due obedience in their fathers honest and lawful choises. This
therefore in all humility, even in the bowels of lesus Christ I request at the
hands of them both, that they seek not how to be wise and witty (or rather
in deed) wily how to devise windlesses and starting holes to shrowde and hide
themselves in, when they should perform their duties on either part in this
behalf.

The children can say for themselves, w^^ are old enough, The plea of some
children for the m^^ king of their own matches.
and therefore able enough to make our own choice: we see it to be daily
practiced by others, yea and peradventure w^ do know (as having hard our
parents sometimes in their merrimentes to brag of the same) our fathers have
matched without the consent of their parents, and have all this
notwithstanding done well enough, and lived very well: why therefore should
not we also do the like? The question here is not, The reply.
what children in regard either (...) age or wit are able for to do but what
God has thought meet and exped e^t, nay, straightly charged and commanded
that they should do. For there are many children found sometimes far to exceed
their fathers in wit and in wisdom, yea and in all other gises both of mind
and body, yet is this no good reason that they should take upon them their
fathers anthoritie. The wife may not therefore be a master, because she has
more knowledge sometimes then her husband, but she must obey, and the husband
is to rule, because that God has willed that it should be so. And albeit that
matches made without the consent of parents have often good success,
accroding unto the things which fall out outwardly in this life, yet that is
not to be imputed unto this disordered and unnatural course, but unto God his
mercy that always does better for us, then we have deserved. And whereas it
is said, that our parents have matched without the choice and consent of their
parents, therefore we also will choose for ourselves according unto our own
liking, besides that the breach of duty in the father does not excuse the like
disobedience in his son: A bad son, that will have his father go with him
unto the devil for company.
what art thou that think it not enough that thou go unto the Devil thy
self unless thou have thy father to go with thee also for company? For as
thy sin of disobedience, if God grant thee not repentance of the same, shall
in his justice press thee down even unto hell. So likewise shall thy fathers
marieng without the allowance of his parents, be sufficient to condemn him, if
together with the rest of his sins it be not covered in the merits of Jesus
Christ our Savior. And the example of Judah may fitly serve to instruct thee
in this point, that though thy father have married without the choice of his
friends, yet thou art not in like manner to marie without the consent of them,
Genesis 38.
for albeit Judah took unto himself a Cananitish woman without the priuitie
and liking of his father Iaacob, yet did he provide a wife for his own
children Er, and Onan, whereby we gather that the fault, the which he
committed in himself, he did not like nor allow of in his sons.

Setting a side therefore all cunning gloses and colorable devises hammered in
the Devil his forge, A profitable counsel for all good natured children.
whereby he teaches his scholars to be subtle in inuenting reasons to
maintain their stubborn disobedience in not being ruled by the grave advise
and godly counsel of their parents as touching their marriage matches, let
all dutiful and good natured children in the reverence and fear of God
consider what honor and obedience they do owe unto their parents and what
power and authority he has in his word sanctified unto the^ over their
children in the Lord, in regard hereof let them yield, unto them this duty,
that their fathers having provided for them such as are not of a wicked life,
nor deformed or evil favored, nor of a contrary religion, they willingly
submit themselves unto their choice, which if for the present, or upon the
sudden they cannot yield unto, let them by earnest call ling upon the name of
God desire him to subdue in them this corrupt affection and that he will frame
their will to be pliable unto their fathers in such lawful cases: lawful I may
well call them, because that the civil constitutions and ordinances do ratify
and allow of them: the two former especially, setting down that children are
to give the consent unto the fathers choice, where the party chosen is not of
infamous life, 2 Cor. 6.14.
nor in shape or favor so blemished, as it may worthelie be supposed that the
same may be an occasion of the withdrawiug of love As for the third caution, or
prouiso of not gra^ting unto the fathers choice in the cause of contrary
religion, it is confirmed flatly by the counsel of the Apostle, where he
wills that we should not draw the yoke with infidels, which if it hold in
other cases of the affairs of this life, much more ought it to be of force in
marriage matters, marriage (I mean) hereafter to be made and not such as are
already made, for where the knot is once already knit, there disparitie, or
vnequalnes in religion is no just cause of separation.

Yea and in this most grave and weighty cause, In providing of watches for
their children, par^ntes ought to begin with prayer.
I would be author unto all christian parents that they take not the same
lightly in hand as if it were but a toy, or a jest, but that they begin it with
prayer that in the whole actio^ they may in such sort be directed, that they do
nothing against the word of God, or unbeseeming the same authority, the which
God himself in this cause has imposed or laid upon them. And thus doing, God
no doubt will ad a blessing unto their godly endeavor and holy care, and
work obedience in the hearts of their children, as he framed the heart of
Isaac with entire affection to embrace Rebeccah, whom his father Abraham had by
his Steward provided for him. And least that any should imagine that this
counsel is a pecuish fancy of a too much spiced and nice conscience, the
parents ought to be induced and persuaded hereunto, Genesis 24.7. Aben Ezra
holds this to have been a prayer.
first by the example of Abraham, who committing the charge of providing a wife
for his son unto his servant, prays that God will send his Angel before
him to direct him in this business.

Secondly the course which Abraham his servant takes in the effecting of this
charge does teach no less, Genesis 24.12.
of whom we read, that he entered into this business with prayer: Genesis 24.26.
that he gives thanks unto God, when he meets with Rebeccah: Genesis 24.5^.
that he praises God when at the delivery of his message, the parents
without gaine-saieng granted their consent.

And whilst I give this counsel unto the parents, Children mariage-able are
to pray unto God to direct their parents in a godly choice, and to incline
their minds to accept of the same.
I would not have the children think that I discharge them of this duty, of
whom the same is by so much the more to be put in practice, by how much they
are more subject to be carried away with the swift current of their stay-lesse
affections, from whom we hear too often these and such like more then
profane and heathenish speaches': I will marie to please mine own eye, and
not to satisfy the mind of my father: I will never match with him that woeth
my parents before he woeth me: Shall I go to the father before I am sure of the
daughter. etc. Whereas in very deed they are not at all once so much as to
make the least motion of marriage unto the daughter, unless before they, have
obtained the good will and liking of the father. For in these cases let the
daughters, if they shall be thereunto solicited and woed, learn of the
example of the maiden out of the Poet, and of Cyrus out of Xenophon cited
before, to say unto their suitors: My Father and my mother have to determine and
dispose of my marriage, this is a matter not belonging nor appertaining unto me.
The heathen have borne themselves in this dutiful sort toward their
parents, and shall I that profess my self a christian come so far short of
the^ in this duty, as to contract my self without the consent and knowledge of
my elders? Nay let the^ say with Tamar, as it is in the story of the kings:
Speak I pray thee unto my father, for he will not deny me unto thee. etc. 2 Samuel 13 verse. 13


And here, when as I enter into the consideration of the contrary bad course
and practice of the world, in intising of men's sons and daughters unto
marriage without, Against intising of children unto marriage without the consent
of parents.
nay against the consent and will of their parents, it makes me astonished and
amazed, to hear that a great many, and the same otherwise very civil and
honest, are to be found almost in all places, the which not only do not
dislike of this shameful disorder, but hold it as it were but a sport and a
play, yea that which more is, go about to countenance and defend this
notorious kind of shameless theeuerie, (for so I will not fear to call it)
the which also does far better deserve to be punished with death, then a
great many crimes that are punished with the same. Yea thou thy self which
likest hereof well enough and too well, if a thief take but xx. shillings sio^
thee by the highway side, thou will hang him, if thou can: and art thou so bad
an esteemer of things, that thou do value the stealing away of a man's
child at a less rate, then the taking away of his money? Will thou condemn him
that steals away thy beast, and justify him that robs thee of thy
daughter? Deuteronomy. 24 7.
The law of God appoints death unto such as steal men's children and sell the^
into slavery of the body, and what the^ think thou is their offense which
steal men's daughters against the consent of their parents, to live all their
life time in whordome and adultery, which is a spiritual slavery and bondage
of the soul, by which without repentance it perishes everlastingly, whereas
the bodily bondage nothing preiudicateth or hinders the liberty of the
soul, but that it notwithstanding may be a free man unto Christ? If theft by
the consent, and judgment of all the learned be truly defined, and said, to be
the taking away and withholding of another man his goods, against the will of
the owner of the same: and children, as has bin before proved, be by good
right to be rekoned especially among the substance of their parents: how then,
is it not theft to steal away men's children by intising them unto marriage? And
this argues a great prophanenes of our time, and a wonderful growth, and
increase of sin unto his highest top, that whereas all other thieves for
the most part either steal in the night, or else disguised and vizarded in
the day time, keeping themselves secret and hidden least being taken, they
stretch a rope for their labor: the stealers of our daughters sometimes will
not stick to tell us to our faces, that if they cannot obtain them with our
good will, Shameless boldness.
they will if they can by any means, one day enjoy them in despite of our
teeth. And when they have once achieved their deuilishe purpose, and offered
villainy unto our children, in defiling of their bodies, they do not as other
thieves, keep themselves aloof and creep into corners, but offer themselves
willingly enough to be known, making within themselves this reckoning, and
sometimes openly vaunting hereof among their friends, that having thus
dishonested our children, we shall in the end be glad to make suit unto them to
keep them, for fear least like unto graceles Amnon, they should turn them
thus abused, home again unto us. 2 Samuel 13.15.
This is the daily practice, and yet who almost is sorry for the same? But if
there be no man nor woman to be found, having any spark of conscience left
unquenched, but confesses, that he would not have his own son and daughter
intised after this manner, let us not then any longer go about to uphold,
that done unto others, the which we would dissalow and greatly mislike being
done unto our selves, and in our own cases For this rule shall otherwise,
remain still in force enough against us: Do not unto another, that which thou
would be loath should be done unto thy self.

An objection of maid-stealers. But it may be answered hereunto, not by the
Sheepe-stealers, but by the maid stealers, that they have the consent and
goodwill of the maiden, and that peradventure so far forth, that she has in
most earnest manner, yea even with tears, and for all the love sake that ever
was between them, made request and suit unto them to carry and conueigh her
away, and by some secret means to be married unto them etc. Answer. This is
indeed a very plausible couloure, and such as carries a great show of
reason among many, but is in truth the very worst plea that they could
possibly have made for themselves of all others. For do they not see, how by
this means they do not alone quite cast and clean overthrow themselves, but
also accuse and condemn the party, whom they have after this sort seduced and
intised? For besides their own fault in going about this matter without the
consent of their parents, (the which as has been showed sufficiently already,
they ought like good children to have tarried for) they have caused the maiden
also, to cast off and break in sunder the coardes of due obedience unto her
father or mother, which great contempt, the Lord will not suffer unrevenged.
And because that such manner of co^tracts are altogether by God his word
unlawful, therefore in carnaly knowing the one the other (the which for the
most part is the best end of these bad compactes) they have committed
fornication, heaping as it were drunkenesse unto thirste, that is to say,
committing one sin in the neck of another, the which may not hereby be
excused, for that they have plighted and vowed their faith and troth the one
unto the other, and therefore they cannot in conscience forsake one another.
That the vo^^ and promise th^^ which childr^ make to ma^^ the one vnt^ the
other, without the consent of t^ parents is n^ matter of c^ science, and may
lawful^ be broken.
For it must first be considered, whether their vow and promise be lawful or
no, before they enter into a settled determination, to perform and keep the
same. For where the vow is unlawful, there can be no breach of conscience in
observing and fulfilling the same. And as in all other cases, and actions of
ours, the word of GOD mus^e be our warrant, to try the lawfulnes, or
unlawfulness, of the same, so also in this most chiefly, when we vow or
promise by giving our says, to do any thing in his name. For nothing can
please God, the which is not agreeable unto his will, and we have no other
certificate left us to assure us of his will, but only his word. Wherefore
whatsoever cannot be warranted by the same, is not agreeable unto his will, and
so consequently can by no means please him. Let us then see a little, whether
this vowing and giving of faith and troth in marriage, without the parents
agreeing thereunto, be to be holden lawful, yea, or no, the which shall easily
appear unto us thus: what soever cannot be performed, without the breach of
God his commandment, that same is utterly unlawful to be done, but to vow
faith and troth in marriage, without the consent of parents, can not be
performed without the breach of God his commandment, therefore for children
to give their faith and troth in marriage, without the consent of their
parents, is utterly unlawful. As concerning vows God teaches us in the 30.
of Numbers that being made by the children, and not ratified by the parents,
they are unlawful, and if unlawful not to be performed And that it is against
God his commandment, for children to handfast themselves in wedlock, their
parents consent not going there withal, has at large been discoursed, being
the only matter of this Treatize, whereof ensues, that these promises being
unlawful, they do not at all bind the conscience of the makers of them to
perform the same, nay rather the perfourming of them, is a matter not of
conscience, but flat against conscience, if to do the thing that is unlawful,
and unlawful by the word of God, be a matter against conscience, the which
none, unless the face be made of seasoned wainscot, will easily deny. Let not
those therefore the which plead conscience for their excuse in this bad matter,
any longer deceive themselves with this broken reed, the which, if one lean
upon, it will straight ways break unto shiuers, An unlawful vow or promise
may laws fully be broken.
but rather whosoever have in this sort vowed, or promised rashly, let them
understand, that their vow and promise, may a great deal more safely be
broken, then performed, except the good will of the parents may be obtained,
and yet in this case also, their former rashness is earnestly and with unfeigned
and hearty sorrow to be repented, that God through his mercy in Christ do not
impute it and lay it unto their charge. And this advise I would have to be
understood either of contractes, or of marriage also by such intising means,
though the parents good will may be afterwads procured. But if after such privy
and stolen contracts and marriages, the good liking of the parents cannot be
won, what punishment ought to be inflicted and laid upon the offenders, as well
in regard of their own default in breach of duty unto their parents, as also
that others by their smart may be terrified and feared from running into the
like, it is not for me being no lawe-maker to determine: I leave that unto the
wise discretion of the godly magistrate, who I hope heareafter will carry a more
heavy hand toward this he nous and notorius crime, and see some discipline
also to be ordained for all such disobedient and unruly children, the which by
their rash and headstrong attentes, have forstalled the right of their godly
parents, howsoever afterward they can get their good will.

And thus, The conclusion.
since the law of nature, the law of God, the authority of the scriptures, the
examples of the godly recorded in the same, the practice of the better sort,
among the very Heathen, the testimonies of the Poettes in their Comedies, and
Tragedies, the Fathers, Councels, Decrees, Canons, and civil constitutions of
the purer sort, yea some of the very Popes themselves, and lastly the firm
consent of the best Divines of these our days, maintain and uphold the
parents right in providing of honest matches in due time for their children,
and prove their contractes made without their parents consent, to be of no
validity or force, neither before God or man: I may lawfullye conclude, that it
is the fathers charge to make a godly choice, for his sons and daughters in
the way of marriage, without whose consent they are at no hand to knit up the
same, unless the godly magistrate in cases of extremity by his authority
do take such order, so that hereafter my good hope is (the duties on both
sides being now so plainly set down, that no ignorance in this behalf may
any longer henceforth be pretended) that as parents respecting God his glory,
will diligently and carefully practice the one, so their children in all
humble obedience will peforme the other, which God grant at the length for
Christ his sake.

Amen.
FINIS.
An afterwritte to the gentle Reader.
MY purpose was (right gentle Reader) in this short discourse before going, by
strong and sound proves to make this point of doctrine appear most clearly,
the which of the most has never bin so much as once thought upon, and whereof
a great number, very sensible men otherwise, have hitherto bin of this
persuasion, that the word of God, speaks not at all, namely of this duty of
the parents in making choice for their childrens marriage, or of the obedience,
the which the sons and daughters in this respect do owe, unto the godly
choice of their fathers and mothers in this so holy an action.

How I have performed the same, I leave unto the judgment of the indifferent
Reader, upon the considerations of the reasons and authorities by me alleged,
in the which my chief end and drift was, to satisfy the godly and well
disposed Christians, the which will make some care of conscience to perform
that hereafter, the which hitherto of ignorance and want of instruction, they
have neglected and omitted. For when as parents shall henceforth plainly
see, Parents.
that God himself lays upon them this necessary duty of bestowing their
children honestly and godly in wedlock: and the children evidently now
perceive that they ought to stand unto the godly choice of their parents,
those in whose hearts the fear of God is not utterly quenched, will
henceforward endeavor themselves to yield obedience unto their superiors in
this most necessary and weighty duty, Children.
with all willingness being contented to be ruled, and not to seek rule, nor
to intrude and thrust themselves into the right and liberty of their parents,
upon whom the Lord in his wisdom has laid his charge, so that without their
priuitie and consent, they will not entangle themselves in marriage, nor seek
unto themselves matches, such as may be griefs and eie-fores unto their
loving Parents, unto whom in the Lord they worthelie owe all obedience and
dutiful subjection. I speak here of the godly and better sort both of
parents and also children, who being of the people and Church of God, will be
ordered and ruled by the laws and ordinances, the which he himself has set
down for the direction and government of the same in all other their ways and
actions. As for the wicked and ungodly, which rebelliouslie think in their
hearts and sometimes blasphemouslie utter with their mouths: Let us break his
bands and cast his cords from us. that is, Psalm. 2.4.
will not suffer God to reign over them after such manner as he has appointed
in his word, I make small account or reckoning of their either liking or
disliking of this my simple labor, but refer them over unto him that dwells
in heaven, and laugheth at them and shall have them in derision. But unto all
you that either be in truth Christians, or otherwise would so be taken and
accounted, know you that this custom of the parents placing and bestowing
their children in marriage, is as has been showed, most ancient, and
comme^dable, yea and approved by our Lord and Savior Christ himself also in
the xx of Luke, Luk, 20.11.
where, going about to confute the error of the Saduces, the which, if there
were a resurrection (which they deny) did suppose that there must be also
marriage, he avouches it to have been the ordinary practice of the men of
those times to give their children to be married: saying, The children of this
world mary wives, and are given or bestowed in marriage, (...) (...) ^th to
place (...) bestow in marriage, as the parents (...), ^he^ as they give their
children to be married
for so does the verb (...), which in that place he uses, most properly in
the judgment of the learned signify. And by the men of this world, as well the
wicked as the godly, least that otherwise we might think that marriage does
not appertain unto the children of God if we should here take children of this
world as opposite and set against the children of light, or of God, as I
confess it must some times be taken, which in this place cannot be least it
might seem to give some countenance unto the error before recited. So that
hereby clearly appears, that in the days of Christ 1589, years since and
more, this was an order generally observed, for the parents in marriage to
place and bestow their children, the which also Beza, Beza says that this
place most strongly proves the power and authority of parents in bestowing
their children in marriage.
and Feguernekinus, who has profitably abridged Marlorat his common places,
does note upon this place. Let not Christians therefore dislike of that, which
Christ himself, after whom they are named, seems to commend. But let them
rather, knowing what God looks for at their hands, in due season provide
wives for their sons, and husbands for their daughters, least by forslowing
the time too long, they be either prevented by their childrens to rash
contracting themselves, or otherwise to their greater sorrow, see them run
into more greater folly, as it often comes to pass, when as the sons and
daughters, think that their fathers and mothers have no care of them in this
behalf, yea in this business let them carry so gentle an hand toward their
children, that they themselves feeling best their own estate, when as they be
come unto years and discretion convenient, may, if their childly modesty will
suffer them deal with their parents concerning this matter in an humble and
reverend manner by themselves, or otherwise by the godly intercession of their
friends, who at their motion may put their parents in mind, in time
convenient to have care of these cases, by means whereof, many inconveniences
and disorders shall be met with ill before hand, the which for want of this
Christian foresight on both sides, do too usually fall out, to the dishonor of
God, and offense of his Church The end of all is, that both the parents and
the children, understanding what God looks for on both their parts in this
business, set aside all caueling and cunning gloses to shake of this duty. For
I will not trouble my self with aunswering these many and vain objections on
this behalf, usual to be alleged on both sides, but refer them over unto
the through shifting of their several consciences in these actions, according
unto that, the which by this treatise, they shall learn to appertain unto
their several duties, that they may in sincerity and truth effect the same,
being desirous, as purposedly to offend none, so gladly in this point to
satiffie al, the which if it be not alrea^dy performed accordingly, so far as
the question taken in hand, to prove requires, I will endeavor, as I shall
heareafter by any the godly be advertised, and labor (God willing) more fully
and largely (so far as in me lies) to set down, to the full contentment of
all such as are not purposedlye resolved and determined, in this cause to
cavil, thwartle, and dissemble, hoping that the godly shall profit, to the
perfourming of a necessary duty, yet of a great part left unperformed, and
the wicked be made vnexcuseles, when the accounts must be rendered, before that
judge, which shall give sentence without regard of the person of any
whatsoever, that shall coulorably seek to withdraw his neck out of his lawful
and dutiful obedience. Wherefore in this duty, or any other, the which the
warrant of God his word may justify, howsoever the same in any respect may
seem strange unto us, let it be our continual and most earnest prayer, to
desire God to subdue our corrupt and carnal affections unto his most holy
will, and godly pleasure, so far forth as we shall have his word the
infallible lode-stone to direct and guide us unto the same, for Christ his
sake. Amen.
