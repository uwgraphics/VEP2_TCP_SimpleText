Here begins the prologue or prohemye of the book callid Caton / which
book has been translated in to English by Master Benet Burgh / late
Archedeken of Colchestre and hye chanon of saint stephens at westmestre / which
full craftly has made it in balade ryal for the erudicion of my lord Bousher /
Sone and heyr at that time to my lord the earl of Estsex And by cause of late
came to my hand a book of the said Caton in Frensshe / which reherceth many a
fair learning and notable ensamples / I have translated it out of frensshe in
to English / as al along here after shall appiere / which I present unto
the Cite of london /
UNto the noble ancient / and reno^med Cite / the Cite of london in England /
I William Caxton Cytezeyn and coniurye of the same / and of the fraternity and
felauship of the mercerye owe of right my seruyse and good will / and of very
duty am bounden naturelly to assiste aid and counceille as ferforth as I can
to my power / as to my mother / of whom I have received my noureture and living
/ And shall pray for the good prosperity and polecye of the same during my life
/ For as me seems it is of great need / by cause I have known it in my young
age much more welthy prosperous and rycher than it is at this day / And the
cause is that there is almost none / that entendeth to the common well but only
every man for his singular prouffyte / O when I remember the noble Romans /
that for the common well of the Cite of Rome / they spente not only their
moeuable goods / but they put their bodies and lives in Ieopardy and to the
death / as by many a noble ensample we may see in thactes of Romans / as of the
two noble scipions Affrican and Asyan / Actilius and many other / And among al
other the noble Catho auctor and maker of this book / which he has left for
to remain ever to all the people for to learn in hit and to know how every man
ought to rewle and govern him in this life / as well for the life temporal / as
for the life spyrytuel / And as in my Judgment it is the best book for to be
taught to young children in scole / and also to people of every age it is full
convenient if it be well understood / And by cause I see that the children
that been borne within the said cite encreace / and prouffyte not like their
faders and olders / but for the most part after that they ben comen to their
parfight years of discrecion / and rypenes of age / how well that their faders
have left to them great quantite of goods / yet scarcely among ten two
thryue / I have seen and (...) / ^^other lands in diverse cytees / that of one
name and lygn^^^ successyuely have endured prosperously many heirs / (...) v
or vj honderd year / and sum a thousand / And in this noble cite of london /
it can uneath continue unto the third heyr or scarcely to the second / O
blessed lord when I remember this I am al abashed / I can not Judge the cause
/ but fayrer ne wyser ne bet bespoken children in their yongthe ben nowher
than there ben in london / but at their full rypyng there is no carnel ne good
corn founden but chaff for the most part / I wo^^e well there be many noble
and wise / and prove well and ben better and rycher than ever were their faders
/ And to the end that many might come to honor and worship / I entende to
translate this said book of cathon / in which I doubt not / and if they will
read it and understand they shall much the better conne rewle them self there
by / For among all other books this is a synguler book / and may well be
called the Regyment or governance of the body and soul / There was a noble
clerk named pogius of Florence / And was secretary to pope Eugenye / and also
to pope Nycholas which had in the cite of Florence a noble and well stuffed
lybrarye / which all noble straungyers coming to Florence desired to see /
And therein they fond many noble and rare books And when they had axyd of
him which was the best book of them all / and that he reputed for best / He
said / that he held Cathon glosed for the best book of his lyberarye / Then
sith that he that was so noble a Clerk held this book for the best / doubtless
/ hit must follow that this is a noble book / and a virtuous / and such one
that a man may eschew all vices and ensiewe virtue / Then to the end that
this said book may prouffyte unto the herars of it / I byseche Almighty god
that I may acheue and accomplysshe it unto his laud and glory And to
therudicion and learning of them that been ygnorau^t that they may there by
prouffyte and be the better / And I require and byseche all such that find
fault or error / that of their charity they correct and amend hit / And I
shall hertely pray for them to Almighty god / that he reward them

^^N this small lytyl book is contained a short and profitable doctrine for
all manner of people / the which is taken and composed upon the said book of
Cathon with some addicions and auctoritees of holy doctors and prophets / And
also many Historyes and ensamples autentyke of holy faders and ancient
Chronicles true and approuued / Item this little book shall be divided in two
parties pryncipal / The first party pryncipal is the proheme which begins
Cumanimaduerterem / And endures unto Itaque deo supplica / The second party
pryncipal / is the trayttye and all the manner of this present book / which
begins Itaque deo supplica / anendureth unto the end of the said little
book / Item this second party pryncipal is divided in two parties / the first
is in prose / And the second in verse / the first party which is in prose
begins Itaque deo supplica / And endures unto Si deus est animus / the
which conteyneth lvi commandments Item the second party which is in verse
/ is subdyuyded in to four parties / The first begins at Si deus est animus
/ and endures unto Telluris si forte / the which conteyneth forty
commandments / The second party begins at Telluus si forte / and endures
unto / Hoc quicunque velis / which conteyneth xxxv commandments / The third
party begins at hoc quicunque / and endures to Securam quicunque / which
conteyneth xxvj commandments / the fourth party begins at Securam / and
endures unto the end of the book / And conteyneth lvj commandments / And so
this present little book conteyneth in sum two honderd xiij commaundments /
as well in prose as in verse / But to the end that thystoryes and examples that been contained in this little book may be lyghly founden / And also for to know
upon what commandments they ben adiousted and alleged / they shall be
set and entytled by manner of Rubrysshe in the commandment upon which each
shall be contained and alleged / And they shall be signed as that followed of
the nombre of leaves where they shall be wreton /

Thus ends the table and the Rubrishes of this present book which is called
caton in English right singular and prouffytable / And over and above these
that be comprysed in this said table is many a notable commandment / learning
and counceylle much profitable which is not set in the said regystre or
rubrysshe /
CVm animaduerterem quam plurimos homines errare in via moru^ / Succurrendu^
and consulendum opinioni eorum fore existimaui-Maxime vt gloriose viuerent and
honorem contingerent / nu^c te fili carissime docebo quo pacto mores tui animi
componas / Igitur mea precepta ita legito vt intelligas / legere enim et non
intelligere negligere est
When I remember and consydere in my courage / that much people err grievously
in the way of manners and of good doctrynes because they use no manner of
Justice ne of reason / by which they be the more disordynate / and obstynate in
their Iniquyte and evil / for the which cause I have delybered and concluded
oftymes how I might remedy / correct / socoure / and give good cou^ceyl to
their false and disordynate opinion and Injustice / because that many hold and
sow many errors dyuerce and contrary to good Justice / equity / and reason /
and therefore I have delibered in mine heart to help and correct the errors
and false opynyons / for eueriche by right and law written ought to correct
his propre error / and also therrour of his neighbor and of his christian
brother / to the end that every man might live gloriously / that is to say
virtuously / and that he may to thonour and preysyng of god and of the world /
by cause that they that live virtuously / use reason / Justice / and equity /
and have praysyng of god and of all the world / And this is that the phylopher
says in the book of the etiques / which says for to come to worship and
praysyng is none other thing but to have witness in him self of sum good and
virtue / how be hit that sum good is spyrituel / as virtue or science / And
temporel as ben rychesses and puyssaunces / And therefore my right dear and
welbelouyd sone I shall teache and show to the clearly in the doctrynes and
commau^dementis / that thou shall here herafter / That is to wete the form
and the manner / how thou may rule the manners of thy courage / That is to
know how thou may rule and govern thy body and thy soul in this world / as
well in good works spirituel / as in good werkys temporel / and therefore read
and read efte ageyn often times my commandments in such wise that thou
understand them / and reteyne them in thy mind / For to read and not
understand is a thing dyspyteuse and vnproffytable and of no prouffyte / in
which there abides no truth prouffytable ne no perfeccion of entendement /
for it is said in a common proverb / that he that redeth / and no thing
understands does as much as he that hunteth and no thing takes / And
therefore it suffyseth not to read my commandments / without they be
vnderstonden / and to what purpos I have said them / For thou ought to read
and read them efte ageyn more than an hundred times / or unto the time that
thou understand them / and reteyne them well and perfytely / And then thou
shall ^^conne rule thy body and thy soul in this world / and therefore may this
book well and ought to be entytled the r^^ile and government of the body and of
the soul /

Itaque deo supplica
THe first commandment is that thou ought to pray and adoure god thy
creator only and none other / For if so were that honor and reverence that
is due to god / were given to any other creature / than to god / that should be
ydolatrye as thou shall here hereafter / And thou ought to know that there
be five manners / for to bear and do honor and reverence to god his creator
/ That is to wete / to work / adoure / swear sacrefyse / and preyse by cause
that god is the vnyuersel commaundour of all our production / beginning and
gouernemente / Thou ought to know that Idolatrye is none other thing / but
tenbaunce and give the reverence / that ought to be given to god to any other
creature / Therefore I will show how ydolatrye was first found / and there ben
five causes / The first was for to eschew the malencolye of the death of sum
persons / hereof recounteth the wise man / of a man that lost his sone / whom
he loved much hertelye / But for teschewe the malencolye of the death of his
sone / and for to have perpetuel remembrance of him / did do make an image
unto the resemblaunce of the figure of his sone / the which image he
commanded to be worshypped by his subgettes and servants upon pain of
Inobedyence / Of this first cause of ydolatrye recounteth saint Gregore in his
xj chappytre of saint luke / How the king of nynyue when he was deed in
battle his sone which was king after him / did do make an image to the
resemblaunce of his fader / the which image he adoured deuoutely / and
commanded expressly to be worshypped and adoured of all the subgettes of his
royame / And to the end that his subgettee should have the more gretter devotion
to the said image / he did do make an edycte or a decree / that al they that
had commysed offense against the ryal mageste / that they should adoure the said
image / and all that so did should be pardoned / The second cause wherefore
ydolatrye was founden was for the great pride and surquerdrye of sum princes
which sometime made them to be adoured and worshypped as god / As we have an
ensaumple of the king Nabugodonosor / For to the end that he should be adoured
as god / He commanded to olofernes which was prince of his land and of his
chyualrye / that he should destroy all the gods of his royame / to the end
that he should be reputed and honored as god in all his contre / The third cause
was fou^den by adulacion or flaterye / For to Impetre sum graces against
sum lords / as done they that been pour / which adoure the rich princes
and great lords as they were gods / For to have their grace and benyuolence
/ hereof recou^teth saint austyn in the tenthe book of the cite of god that
says / that many things ben taken aweye fro thonoure and adouryng deuyne /
the which ben atrybued and given to kings and princes temporel / in geuyng to
them gretter honor and reverence tha^ they do to god / this spice of
ydolatrye regneth yet at this day with kings and princes of this world which
make them self to be adoured more tha^ god / The iiij cause of ydolatrye / was
by cause that they adoured the ydolles / wha^ they were required of any thing
/ and that they gate or had as they demanded they supposed that the deuyls
that were within the images had might and power upon them and upon the
Elements / as for to do sece al tempests / al maladyes / and aduersitees that
might happen to them / which thing was suffered to come to them by deuyne
suffraunce / as it shall be declared herafter / The v cause of ydolatrye was for
his evil couetyse / and that was for to get the goods and honors of this
world / as done they ^^hat selle them and give them to the deuyls to the end
tha^^ the^^ ^^ay accomplisshe their evil wylles and worldly desires /

THere be found seven spyces of ydolatrye / the first is for to adoure the
deuyls / The second to adoure the light / as the son the moon and the sterres
/ the third is for to worship elements as the fire the earth the water and the
eyer / The fourth is to adoure men and the creatures reasonable / The fyfthe is
to adoure the bestes brute and unreasonable / The syxte is to adoure the images
and other fygures humayn / I say not that men ought not to worship thymages of
saints of heaven and of the vyrgyn marye for so much as they give us memory /
and make representacion of (...) sa^^tes that been in heaven / and none otherwise
/ For hit should (...) be ydolatrye / the vij is to adoure the time / and know
ye that for to adoure al these things aforesaid as god / is heresye /

Parents ama
THou ought to love thy fader and mother next after god / and to aid help
and sustain them in their necessyt^^es / Therefore says the phylosophre /
(...) is as much to say as a name of love / for the sone ought to fail his
fader for no thing / but ought to love him with very love and dilection
without any fayntyse / and to help and sustain him after his puyssaunce and
faculte / as we read of a daughter / that sometime nourisshed her fader with her
propre milk which was in prison / for which cause her fader was delyuerd out
and rendrid quyt in remembrance perpetuel of the great love that the sad
daughter had to her fader /

Cognatos ^^ole
THou ought to honor and vysite often thy cosyns and to have and hold
them in great reverence /

But thou ought to know / that there be three manner of cosyns / The first
is spirituel as ben godfaders and godmoders / The second is legale / the which
cause is by adopcyon / The third is carnal the which comes by consanguynyte /
and by lygnage naturelle /

Datum serua
TThou ought to keep the thing that is given unto the / and to have it in
mind in time coming / to the end that thou may render and yield somewhat
therefore / For thou art bounden by right so to do / so keep well the thing
that is given to the / That is to vnderston^^ ^^hat thou keep well the yefte of
a good man that is given to the / Like as a precious Jewel for the honor and
reverence of him / And thus thou shall be moeuyd after to give him ageyn / but
consydere and think dylygently before or thou give / to whom thou ought /
to give /

Beneficij accepti Memor esto
THou ought to remember of the benefaytes of the received / And first thou
ought to give than kings thereof to god thy creator / Secondly to them that
have given hit to the / to the end that in time and place thou may guerdon
them / that have so well done to the if they have need and necessyte /

Maiori cede locum
THou ought to give place to him that is gretter and more of valewe than
thou art / that is to say when thou see one more ancient and more
honorable than thou art in any science dignyte or office / thou ought to
bear to him honor and reverence in such manner as when thou art set /
thou ought to arise when thou see him come / And if he pass tofore the
thou ought to enclyne and bow thy kne / And if he goo by the ware thou
ought to accompanye him / Hereof we have ensaumple in the gospel that says /
that when thou shall be boden to any weddyng or feste / sytte thou in the
lowest place / to the end that when he comes that has boden the say / to
the friend arise and sytte upper / And thus shall thou be honored of
thassistentis in thy company / For if thou sattest above in the highest place /
and he that bad the said / ffrende descend and sit benethe / that should be
to the shame and dyshonoure and to them of thy company And therefore says
saint ancelme / that the young people ought to be subgette unto the ancient and
obey them / And saint Austyn says / that by right / reason / and Justice the
less owen to obey to the gretter / And the younger ought to arise against the
elder and more ancient and to give to him the chyef place when they will sit
/

Saluta Libenter
Thou sholdest salewe and great the people gladly / that is to wete affectuously
and with god heart without any faynyng / Not for to be salewed ageyn or by
flaterye or by adulacyon / but thou ought to salewe by humylite and hole
will / For salewyng is no thing else but to show good desire / good will
and affeccion to him that is salewed / to the end that he may draw and
enclyne him to love and affabylite / That is to wete against them that at this
day salewe their neighbors in such manner / that such as they say with their
mowthe / is al contrary to that which the heart thinks / Such people maken
of their tunges swerdes / and sin grievously / and also it apperyth that for
to show sign of love under the shadow of decepcion / and it is a right great
sin and great trayson / and also ageynste the right course of nature / For
naturelly every man ought to be loved of al other men / For it is said
comunely / that there is none so evil an enemy / as he that shows him a
friend by fyction and faynyng for to dysceyue him to whom he shows sign of
love / On that other part there is none so great hate as is love faynte and
palled under shadow of decepcion /

Mutuum da
THou ought to lene / and thou ought to keep the thing that is given to
the to keep / to the end that thou may give a count / when thou shall be
required / And also thou shall lene / that is to wete to the suffratouse and
nedy when they have necessyte for good and very love and charity without any
usure / For thou ought to lene without any hope of any gayn as says Saint
luke / lene without hope to have any gain / For to do so warns us holy
scripture right canon and nature / For no man ought to lene his neighbor for
usure / ne give out his silver to usure / For nature and good equity will that
a man should help and lene his neighbor when he is in necessite wythouten any
usure / For it is against nature to take usure / and win with the money that
he has lent / And ye shall understand that the usurers sin more greuouslye
then any other sinner / For all other sinners cessen often their sins / But
the usurers ne sece never of their sins / for night and day every hour /
festes and sondayes they sin and taken their usure contynuelly without secyng
Therefore may be said that they sin more grievously then any other sinners /
Item it may be said that they be werse then Judas / For Judas sold Ihesu
christ only / but these selle the vyrgyn marye / and all the saints of heaven
and their parents and heirs unto the tenthe lygnage / as it apperyth in an
exaumple that here follows / It is read in vytis patrum of a good man / that
required of god that he would show him the pains of hell / To whom our lord
sent an aungel / which led him in to hell / and there he saw many
torments / that they that been dampened suffren / Among all other peynes he
saw a ladder which had ten degrees or stappes / and in each degree was a man
hangyng by order / whom the deuyls beat and all to tare with hooks of iron
much terrybly / and above all the other dampened in hell / it seemed to this
good man that these ten men suffreden more torment and pain then all the
other wherefore he prayed the aungel to tell him why these x men were so hanged
in that ladder / and so horrybly tormented / and what men they were / Then
answered the aungel to him and said this old man that thou see that is in the
highest place of the ladder is an usurer / the which by usure has gotten great
rychesses and possessions / and by cause he deyed without making of restytucion
/ he is hanged in the highest place of the ladder and all his heirs that have
posseded the said herirages / and ben deed without making restytucion be hanged
by order on this ladder unto the tenth degree one after another / like as thou
see /

Cui des videto
TThou ought to take heed to whom thou gyuest wha^ thou wylt give or do any
alms / and this is that ecclesiaste says in his fourtenth chappytre /
which says when thou shall give or shall do any alms / know thou well and
behold to whom thou shall do hit / Item saint Iherome says / give to the
pour people / and not to the rich / and not to the proud / Also he that will
give / ought to consydre three things / First that it which he will give for
alms be truly gotten / for of evil gotten good / no man ought to give al mess /
secondly he ought to hold order and manner in gyuyng for first he ought to give
and help him self / after to his parentis kynne and neighbors / and after to
strangers if he have whereof / Thyrdly he ought to give by very charity and
love without any vaynglorye /

Coniugem Ama
THou ought to love thy wife as thy self / Nevertheless the wife by right
law deuyne / and humayne she ought to be subgette to her husbond / and to keep
to him feythe and truth / and to serve and obey to him in all things lycite
and honest / Also the man ought to entrete his wife hertely and swetely / and
to love her by very love / For as they ben made one flesh by carnal
copulacyon or bodily felawshyp / also they ought to be one heart and one
thought by very dyleccion or love / Item the woman ought to love her husbond
and to bear to him feythe and truth and reverence and to obey him as long
as he shall live / Also the man ought to love his wife and to keep to her feythe
and truth / and to teache and endoctryne her all good conditions
notwythstondyng that many done the contrary / It is read in the ancient
hystoryes or chronicles of Rome / that there was sometime a woman noble and of
great lignage which mysrewled her self and was of evil governance / For the
which cause her husbo^d made her to be put and shette within a toure and toward
her went never no body save only her husbond / It happed on a day as she was
lokyng out of a wyndowe of the said toure which was nyghe by the walls of the
cite / that she saw a student or scoler warnyng that way which she knew
before that time / And as ^^e scoler perceived her he said to her / helas lady
what do you there so high within this toure / Certeynly said she my husbond
has put me here within / and bears the keys of this toure with him in such
manner that from hens I ne depart neither by night nor by day / For at night
he leyeth the keys under his bolster / Ha said the clerk if he will believe me
I shall find well the manner how at night ye shall escape at your pleasure /
Certeynly said she / thereof I pray you and I promyt you to do all that shall
plese you / Then said the clerk / I shall bring to you to morrow sum
powder of man deglorye / of the which ye shall give to him secretly for to
drink at his sowper / and for certain he shall sone after fall on a sleep /
in so much that none shall mow awake him / Ye shall then take the keys from
under his bolster / and then ye shall come to speak with me here benethe / and
to gyder we shall dysporte us / and after ye shall return and laye^^he keys by
him ageyn / For know ye for certain that he shall not awake for no steryng or
noise that ye shall make / wherefore do that to morrow / ye have a small cord
made of the threde that ye spynne and as long that it may reche unto the
ground / and then the little sack full of the said powdre I shall bind thereto
/ And of this couenaunte was the woman content / and in deed the clerk
brought on the morn next the said powdre / and she drew hit up unto her and
took hit / And so much she did that on that same night she gave to her husbond
of the said poudre / both in his mete and in his drink / the which sone
after he went to bed / and began Incontinent to fall in a strong sleep in
so much that the toure might have be beten and smyten down or he should have been awaked / And then when she saw that he slepte she went and took the
keys and opened all the doors and yates of the tower and came down to the
clerk which entered within the toure and leyd them both upon a led which
was in a chaumbre benethe / and three hours they leye to gyder / taking their
pleasure / And after the wife returned and went upward and leyed her by her
husbond ageyn / which was much subtyl and was all abashed that he had
slepte longer than he was accustomed to done / Hit happed then on an even
when he had sowped that he went to bed / and forthwyth made semblaunte to be
on sleep and strongely he began to rowte / and when she saw him a sleep as she
supposed / she took the keys and went down to the clerk as she was
accustomed / And then when her husbond felt that she was gone / he rose up
and went and shette the door of his chamber and went ageyn to his bed For
he must needs sleep three or four hours / Sone after the woman came upward
ageyn and supposed for to have entered within the chamber as she was acustomed
to do / And she was much abashed when she fond the door of hit shette / but
she knocked at the door so long that she did awake her husbond / to whom she
said thus / Helas ye have hasted you much for to shette the door after me when
I issued out for to have gone to do my naturelle need / Then answered to her
her husbond and said / Dame harlote ye come from your rybauldrye as ye be
acustomed / none ne may keep you therfro / goo ageyn and return thither from
whens ye came / for ye shall never lie with me / Then was the woman much
abashed and began to weep and to excuse her self / saying / that hit was not
truth / And then yet ageyn she required him much swetely that he would
opene the door / But for prayer ne request that she made to him he would not
opene hit / And when she saw that by no wise he would not opene the door she
began thus to cry with an high voys / If ye opene not the door I shall cast my
self within the same pytte which is hereby / For rather I will be drowned
then for to be dishonored and shamed all the time of my life / I care not
therefore said her husbond / I would that thou were drowned al ready / And she
then took a great stone which was by the pytte / and castyng hit in the
pytte / She said in this manner / God be with you my friend I will goo drown my
self ye shall never see me on live / And when the husbond herd the noise and
resownyng of the stone within the water / He rose up full hastily and al naked
went out of his chamber toward the pytte / for he supposed that it had be his
wife / and feign would have rescued her / but she was not so much a fool / for
she was hid behind the door / the which Incontinent after that her husbond
was issued out of the chamber she hastily entered in to his chamber and shette
her self within / and her husbond without which was all naked / and after she
opened a wyndowe and began to cry and call her neighbors saying that her
husbond would kylle her / And th^^nne there came the neighbors both men and
wymmen and also sum of her parents / and shortly to say after all
allegacions and compleyntes made of both parts / there was none that might
believe that hit had be so as her husbond said / seeing that he kept her of so
nyghe and of so long time shette and that him self bare the keys of the said
toure / Wherefore in deed the husbond was constreyned to ask and require pardon
and mercy of his wife / and thus the pees was made / By this ensaumple hit
apperyth clearly that great truth is not founden in sum wymmen /

Erudi libros
THou ought to leche to thy children good doctrine and good condycions / For
the philosopher says in the viij book of ethyques / that the fader is cause of
all that the children done / Wherefore they ought to be ^^lso cause of their
condycions of doctrine / For herto ben bounden of right not only the carnal
faders / but also the spyrituel / Boece recounteth in his book of dysciplyne of
the scolers of the sone of lucressys which had to name Zeno / the which his
fader did norysshe in his yongthe without doctrine and without techyng / the
which Zeno expendyd both his goods and the goods of his fader and played
hit at the dyse / and at tables / and after that he became a thief in so much
that his fader kept and bought him ageyn fro the galowes and fro dyshonest
death / At the last he was taken and his fader had no more good for to bye him
and have his life again saufe / and in deed he was led unto the galowes for
to be hanged / the which Zeno or he was hanged he demanded of his fader a
yefte / that is to wete / that he would kiss him or that he should receive death
/ Then as his fader would have kyssed him / he bote his nose of with his tethe
saying in this manner / Fader if ye had well taught and en^^^tryned me in my
yongthe in good condycions / I should not have been brought hither for to be
hanged / and to receive a shameful death / And therefore to the end that ye know
that ye have done evil / and for to give ensaumple to the other / I have byten
of your nose / Therefore says seneque that men must chastyse and teache the
children in their yongthe / as thou have ensaumple of al dombe bestes and of
the trees and of herbys / the which men bow and plye and use them in their
yongthe in such manner plighte as they will have them when they be older /

Familiam cura
TThou ought to have the cure and the government of thy famylle or

after right canon the fader of famylle / and every man that has any
gouernemente or rewle upon his householde is bounden to hit in three manners
First he ought to have and to ordeyne to euerrychone of his servants that /
that to him needs / Secondly he ought to know both the vices and the virtues
of each of his servants / the vices for to chastyse and for to admoneste them
for to do well / and the virtues for to reward them of the good which they
do and have done before / Thyrdly every fader of famylle ought to show good
ensaumple to his servants / to the end that they be not corrumped by evil
ensaumple /

Minime Iudica

great and good delyberacyon and by sure counceyl / For doing otherwise thou
sholdest not be rightful Judge / but sholdest do vniustyce / as done sum
Iuges which Iugen by guess and at all adventure / without making dew proof

Pugna pro patria
THou ought to fight for to keep and defend thy land and contree / That
is to say that al thus as we be holden of right for to defend and keep our
parente^^ because that they have given to us our being / and that they be our

cause and beginning of our proteccion and of al our goods / Tulle says that
emonge al other charity / the charity of our contre ought to be loved and
preferred before al other charitees / for by the common we^^e of a land is
saved al synguler prouffytes and vtylytees / because that of our contree we
take and have all that is nedeful to us / that is to wete our elements /
vestementis or clothynges habytacions o^^ di^^ellynges and delectacions or
plesaunce /

Iusiurandum serua
THou ought to keep thyn oath and to keep it stedfastlye to the end that thou
forswere not thy self / and or ever thou make any oath or any promise / thou
ought to consydere / if thou shall mow hold and keep thyn oath and thy
promise / Every man ought not for to be sworn in all his promysses / but in
all his promysses he ought to keep feyth / Item for to hold and keep feythe
the men ben brought unto feythe / Item many men habyten and dwellyn by feyth
in the cyt^^es / Item for to keep and hold feythe / the kings and princes
have domynacions and lordshippes Item for to keep feyth their forteresses
castles towns and cytees ben sure and sauely kept / Therefore eueryone ought
to keep well his feythe / Saint Austyn and Tulle sayen that a man ought not
only to keep his feyth unto his friends / but also to his enemies /

Minorem te non contempseris
tHou ought not to dyspreyse him which is less than thou art / That is to
say if sum man come of lower degree than thy self / proceeds the in to
so^me dygnyte or worship connyng or office / Nevertheless thou ought not to
dyspreyse him / The prophet says that like as in a body is many lymmes /
Nevertheless all the lymmes or membris be^^ not in one act only / we be many
bodies to gyder only in christ / And nevertheless every membre seruyth to his
body /

Magistrum metue
tHou ought to doubt and to obey to thy master and to bear him reverence
and honor / That is to say that not only they that been in dygnyte or
office we owen to doubt and obey / but also sum which been partyculer in
their office / as ben the masters of scoles / Fo^^ the scolers ought to
doubt them / and to bear unto them honor and reverence /

We read in the chronicles ancient / that many Emperors and kings / How be
hit that they were in great honor and dygnyte / Nevertheless they have borne
reverence and honor to their masters that taught them in their yongthe As
it is read of troianus the emperor / which gretely honored his master named
Plustrate / Item of alyxaunder which much honored his moyster Socrates / For
he being within his charyot of worship descendyd down to the earth / and to
socrates made honor and reverence right excellen^^e and publykely /

Litteras disce
THou sholdest learn the letters and the scyences For by letters and by science
is the man made semblable or like to god / As says saint ambrose / wherefore
hit appears that we owe to learn the letters and the sciences Item thou
ought to know that the scoler which will learn ought to have three
pryncipalle condycions / The first is that he ought not to dyspreys^^ no
scripture ne no science / The second is that he ought not to have shame ne
ve^^goyn to learn of all manner of men that shall mow teache him / The third is
that when he shall have learned well and that he shall be a great clerk / that he
dyspreyse none other / For sum been which will learn and know / to the end
only that they may be reputed and holden sage and wise and for great lords /
The other will learn to the end that they may selle their science and kunnyng for
to get silver and honor / As done these great advocates /

Libros lege
tHou ought to read oftyme the books / and to put in to thy memory and
affeccion that / that they sayen / But none ought to read foul sciences and of
no^^e effect and full of error / as ben foles questyons and scyences /
seculers / ne also the fictions of poetrye /

Que legeris memento
tHou ought to read and to receive and to put in thy memory that / that
thou shall read / and to take to hit dylectaco^n and pleasure / and that thou
forgete hit not lightly / as done many one that read without taking of hit any
pleasure / For that that entryth in to one of their eerys yssueth out ageyn by
their other eere

Nil temere crederis
tHou ought not to believe no thing folysshly / ne lightly that which men
reherceth to the / Seneque says that first men must examyne his counceyll or
men believe / For he which that is of light believe is light of thought and
of wit / Item they which beleuen ageynste the artycles of the feythe / and
generally against our mother holy church universal beleuen folisshly and
synnen dedely /

Nil mentire
tHou ought not to make no lesynges / For a man liar is wor^^ then a thief
/ For the thief sleyth but his body only / but the liar sleeth both his body
and his soul / For lesyng is a sin dyabolyque / And know thou that the
first man that ever made the first lesyng was Caym / because that he lied when
our Lord god demanded of him / where he had done his brother abel And he
answered that he ne wyste ne knew not where he was / And that same time our
lord gave to him the maledyccion or cursyng /

Bonis benefacito
tHou ought to do well to the good / that is to say / that men ought
sonner to do well to the good folk then to the evil / Seneque says that
hit is better to do sum good to sum pour man / then to an evil rich
man / / because that the rich man believes not that the well and honor that
one beryth to them / that is for the love of their money / or else for to have
and Impetre of them so^me good after their death / and as long as they live /

Tute consule
tHou ought to give good counceyll to them that demands hit of the /
That is to wete that thou ought to give good counceyll to them that
demands hit of the by good and sad delyberacyon / For every man sage and
prudente / ought to have memory of the things passed / and pourueaunce and
aduysemement upon the things which been yet for to come / And thou ought
to think often how Justly trewely and lycylly thou shall mow come to thyn
Intencion / and upon hit take and demand counceyl / for none may find ne
ymagyne of him self that which is to him nedeful / And therefore euerichone
ought to take advise to his sayte or deed if he be suffysaunte of him self for
to do and perform that which he had enterprysed without ^^ny counceyll or
help of other /

Maledictus ne esto
tHou ought not to blame ne dyspreyse other / by deed / by spekyng ne by
thought in what manner that hit be / because that it is a thing dyfferent and
contrary to frendshyp and to very love which we ought to have and to bear
each one to other / For there nys so evil a thing ne that lets more the man
/ then the evil tongue Therefore none ought not to dyspreyse ne blame other
upon pain of mortal or dedely sin /

Extimacionem retine
tHou ought to have in thy self and to reteyne extymacion and aduysemente in
all thy werkys / to the end that every man may suppose and say good of the
without any evil to be thought upon the / Saint Thomas says that every
prudent man ought to have extymacion and auysemente in all his faytes and
deeds wherwyth he entremeteth him / and to bye and selle without fraud or
decepcyon /

Consultus esto
tHou ought for to be counceylled and aduysed of thyn own deed / and also
upon the fayte of other / That is to say / that thou be such that thou may
give counceyl to thyn own self / and to the other / where and when need shall
be / Saint Ambrose says that every man that will counceyl other / ought to
have three things in him self / That is to wete sapyence / Justice / preysyng
and true experyence upon that thing on the which he will give counceyll /

Vtere virtute
tHou ought to use virtues and be virtuous in thy self and to have strength
for to resist against all aduersytees / Saint Johan says in the pocalyps who
shall vaynquysshe the world / he that shall ete in paradyse of the fruit of life
/ Therefore thou ought to be feythful and virtuous unto the time of death / and
thou shalt have the crown of life eternal or without end /

Troco lude
tThou ought to play with the top / For the play of the top is good
and vtyle and without fylthe and wrath / For by the same play one may do his
excersyse / and amodere or restreyne in him self all Illycite or evil
cogytacions or thoughts /

Aleas fuge
tHou ought to flee and to eschew all manner of playeng with the tables
and dyse / For by such plays Illicitees and dyshonestees comes homycydes /
Rancoure and brawlyng / Item also comynly by such gamynges one makes of his
friend his enemy / Item thou must know that there been four things wherefore
men ought to eschew all the playeng with tables and dyse and all other
Illycyte and evil plays / The first is for the great multitude of sins
which ensues and comes thereof / The second is for the great trybulacion and
malencolye that the parents and friends of hem that play / have and take
therefore / The third is for the great folly that comes thereof / The fourth is
for the doubt of deuyne vergoyne and shame by playeng with dyse and with
tables and by other Illycyte gamyng comen syxtene sins / The first is auaryce
and couetyse for to win / the which sin is foundemente and root of all
sins and of all evil / The second sin is for to be wyllyng for to
dyspoyle and rauysshe his neighbors goods / the which sin comes fro the
sin of rapyne or theft / Item if the player play within his hows / his
parents and friends ben thereof wroth and trowbled / And if he be married and
have children he is wroth with him self and with his wife and children wherefore
his children ben often time dysheryted by such players / and often ben cause and
occasyon to put their wives and daughters to great dyshonoure and shame / The
third sin is vnmyserycorde and crudelyte / For he which plays would feign
take from his fellow both breche and sherte / the which thing the theuys
which dyspoyle and rob the pilgrims / done not / The fourth sin is usure
/ for hit suffyseth hem not for to take xj for twelve / for one year or for a
month or for one day / For they will have al at ones / The fyfthe sin is
blasphemye of god and of his saints / The vj sin is lesynges and many other
ydelful and vein talkyng / The vij sin is corrumpyng of his parents and of
them that beholden the play / because that oftentimes they Inclyne or bowen
them to such plays by acus^^umaunce / The viij sin is theft / For
oftentimes the players for pouerte when they have lost all that they had /
they set them to rob and to stele wherefore they be hanged / or otherwise
executed by Iustyse / The ix sin is falsehede that they do in making and
ocupyeng false dyse / The x is homycyde / For oftentimes by such plays men
fall in to angry words / and fro words in to smytyng / and fro smytyng unto
kyllyng of each other / therefore oftyme ensues thereof homycyde / The xj sin
is falsehede and decepcion / For he that more better can play / more better he
can dysceyue / The xij sin is ydolatrye / For they maken of the dyse their
god / because that at the commandment of the dyse they take and give their
silver / the which thing is not of the commandments of god / The xiij sin
is brekyng of holidays / For upon the grettest festes of all the year they
play and more upon holidays than upon any other days / The xiiij sin is
ire / The xv sin is leuyng of good deeds which they might do while that
they playen / In players men find twelve folyes and abusyons / The first is a
right great and foul seruytude when they submytte them self / for to do that
the dyse commaunden / The second folly is that they ben ready er for to do the
commandment of the dyse / than the commandment of god / They do not like
saint martyn which gave the half of his mantell / gown sherte and breche /
and after came after his master / because that oftymes they lene to al both
mantellys and gowns / shyrtes and breches And after goon all naked after
their master the devil of hell which governs them / The third is that
after that they know the falsehede of the dyse they ought rather forsake them
/ then to forsake their maker / the which does never to them but all good
/ The fourth folly is because that they put and submytte them to the
Iurisdyccion or Judgment of him which does never good ne Just Judgment /
For he gives to them that which longs not to them The fyfthe is because
that they take gretter dylectacion and pleasure to the dyse / than to the holy
and deuyne things / The syxthe is to the end that they be not ydelful they do
ydel things / Therefore sa^^th saint bernard that it is gretter folly for to
do an idle thing for to eschew ydelnesse / The seventh folly is because that
they suffer that their enemy stele from them one of the most precious things
that they have / that is to wete the time which they lose in playeng / The
viij is because that with their own hands they lose both hem self and their
goods / whom our lord Ihesu christ with his own hands boughte ageyn on the
tree of the cross / The ix is because that while that they play they ben
condemned to death at the court of the souerayn Judge / The tenthe is because
that while they play they might do so^me thing that should be to them
prouffytable and good / and plesaunt to god their creator or maker and to
their friends / and they do the contrary / The xj is because that they do
children werkys / For they play with bones and with stones as done the
children / The twelfthe is that they suppose not to have pleasure in that / they
do without that they have and take of hit sum prouffyte / It is read of a
knight which in his playeng swore by ire and anger by the eyes of our lord
god / to whom Incontynente before all them that were present / his one eye fyl
from his heed upon the table on the which he played /

Item it is read of an archer which for great wrath shot an arowe against
the heaven in despyte of our Lord god / Because that he had lost his silver by
shotyng / the which arowe came not down ageyn unto the next morrow after /
and at such hour as it had been drawn hit fyl ageyn al blody from heaven / It
is read of saint bernard that ones / as he was on an horse back / a player
demanded of him / if he would play his horse against his soul / to whom saint
bernard answered that he was content / the which player Incontinent took three
dyse and cast xviij points / and then he took the horse by the brydel / and
said that hit was his and that he had won hit / Friend abide a little said
saint bernard / for there ben in these dyse sum points which thou see not
/ therefore let me cast / Saint bernard then took the dyse and cast them /
and as he cast them / one of them brake in two parts / and at the one part
of the dyse broken were four points / and on the other part were three / and
on the other two dyse were xij points / and thus saint bernard did cast xix
points / Then when the player saw the miracle he gave to saint bernard his
soul / and to him he made all obeyssaunce / and after he became a monk of
saint bernardes and endyd his life right holyly /

Cum bonis ambula
tThou ought to walk and goo with good folk and flee the evil / That is to
say that thou must put thy self in the feleshyp of the good and virtuous men
and eschew and flee from the evil / full of vices and sins Item it is found
three manners of conuersacions / the first is the good men with the good men /
the second is the good men with the evil and vycious men / the third is the
evil men with the evil men / and the evil men with the good men / The poet
says that the man may not forbere him self without other felawshyp / For every
friend has need of his friend /

Antequam voceris ad consilium ne accesseris
tHou ought not to goo to no counceyl before that thou be called thereto /
For it is gretter presumpcion and folly for to goo to the counceyl of sum
other before that men be called to hit / because that of adventure men will not
that thou know hit / Seneque says that hit is great presumpsion for to
entreme^^te him ne to enquere of the counceyl of other / when he will not that
thou know hit / For he keeps hit secretly for cause of the /

Mundus esto
tHou ought to be pure and clean both of body and of soul / That is to
say that thou ought to keep thy self from vices and fro sin / as of
lecherye / auaryce and of all other sins which ben contrary to the body
and to the soul /

Verecundiam serua
tHou ought to have shame and vergoyne to do evil but not for to do good /
For none ought not to have shame for to do well / Men fynden three manner of
folk before the which men have vergoyne and shame for to do evil / First
before them which ben wise because that men byleuen them lightlye of that /
that they say / be hit good or evil / Secondly before them which ben devout
and holy and before them emonge the which we converse and goo daily / because
that men beleuen them of our fayte or deed sooner then the other which we
know not / Thyrdly before them that can keep no thing secretly / as Iogelers
/ mynstrellys / foles / dr^^nke folk and young children / Fourthly before them
the which saw us never do none evil / because that we should not lose the good
fame or renommee that we had before of them / For they supposen that we had been
good / Fifthely before them of the which we will be loved / Syxthely before
them whche ben contrary to the fayte or deed which we do / because that they
might suppose / that the evil were gretter then hit is /

Rem tuam custodi
tHou ought to keep thy thing / This commandment may be expressed in
three manners / First keep thy thing / that is to say keep thy body and thy
person / the which is made and fourmed to the semblaunce of god thy creator
or maker / Secondly keep thy thing that is to say thy soul from sin /
Thyrdly keep thy thing / that is to say / thy substance and temporelle goods
/ to the end that thou dyspende hit not folisshly by evil syghtes and evil
plays / or else by lecherye / as did the sone of perdicion or loss which
expendyd al his goods with common wymmen dissolute and dyshoneste wythouten
mesure /

Diligenciam adhibe
tHou ought to take dyligence and cure of thy works and in all things
which of need thou must do as well in works spiritual / as corporalle / For
to be dylygent and well aduysed of his fayte / men eschew many great
Inconuenyentes and decepcions as well of the body as of the soul / that is to
wete by believe / good counceyl / and to keep him fro evil counceyl / and fro
the awaytes or watchyng of the enemies both spiritual and corporalle /

Blandus esto
tHou ought to be courteys and benygne / For they which been sweet and
courteys shall not only have the goods of this world / but also they shall have
the eternal goods of god / as says saint Austyn /

Saint bernard says if the humble have the heaven / and the benygne the earth /
what shall god leave for the proud and evil sothely he ne leueth to them other
thing / but the pain of hell and perpetual dampnacion /

tHou ought not to be wroth of a thing uncertain that is to say that when
thou art wroth of a thing uncertain and without cause lawful / thou ought
not therefore to Judge none wrongfully in refraynyng thyn ire For the man which
is overtaken with ire may not see / ne know neither truth ne reason /

Iracundiam tempera
tHou ought to refrain thyn ire / Not only the ire subdayn and subytte /
but also men ought to keep hem self from the ire which is without mesure and
without reason / That is to say / that men ought not suddenly and Inmoderately
avenge him self upon his enemies to his appetyte /

Neminem irriseris
tHou ought not to mock ne scorn none other / specially when thy will is
to have company with hem but thou ought to force thy self for to get his
grace with all thy might /

Miserum noli irridere
tHou ought not to scorn ne mocque the pour unfortunate to whom fortune is
contrary / specially when they ben in their vnfortune and myserye / but thou
ought to comfort and help them after thy power / and to give to them good
hope in god /

Raro conuiua
tHou ought selde to make festys / ete and drink in felawshyp that is to
say that thou ought to goo selde to the festys and etynges of other / ne to
pray oftymes sum other for to ete and drink with the /

It is founden in the ancient historyes / that Alexaunder came in to a contre
/ where as the folk were of great abstynence / wherefore they lived long / To
this purpoos recounteth boece de consolacion / that at the first eage of the
world before the deluge or growyng of waters / the folk ete never flesh ne
drank no wine / but ete only that / that the earth brought forth by nature
without any labor or cultyuyng and fasted unto the even without taking any
manner of substance / and after they sowped them with a few chesteyns and
with acornes / Therefore says boece that they were well happy because that they
were more stronger than we been now at this time / It is founden that men may
have ten prouffytes by sobyrte^^ and abstynence / The first is health of body
and of soul / The second is length of life / The third is gladness of pleasure
of life corporell and spyrytuel / The fourth is that men sleep and rest the
better / The fyfthe is because that men have better appetyte for to ete / The
vj is because that men get therefore preysyng and grace toward god / The
seventh is delyueraunce of death / The viij is refraynyng of mowthe / The ix is
puttyng from him self the wolf / that is to wete the devil of hell / For thus
as hunger chaceth the wolf out of the wode / thus sobrete chaseth the devil
fro the man /

Pauca in conuiuio loquere
tHou ought to speak little or few when thou etest or drynkest / that is to
say that thou ought to speak at thy dinner and sowper by mesure / and when
it is need / Seneque says I command to the that thou speak late and selde /
Saint Ambrose says that he which can not speak well ought to keep his pees /

Quod satis est dormi
tHou ought to sleep by mesure / when it is need and that nature requires
hit and thy complexyon / and no more / that is to say that thou ought to
keep thy self fro ouermoche sleep / and fro ouermoche watchyng / It is found
in the ancient hystoryes that macrobyus when he would fight against the
assiriens / seeing that he was over feeble / and that the assiriens were stronger
than he was / He bethought and aduysed him self to have sum of mande-glorye
powdre which causes and makes men for to sleep / and after he made the said
powdre to be put in to all the pypes full of wine which were within his tente /
and then after that was done / he with all his host made semblaunte to flee /
And then thassiriens came to the said siege with all their might for to have
gone after macrobyus / but before that they went after him they drank so
much of the wynes of macrobyus wherein he had put the said powdre / that sone
they were forced and needs they must sleep / and slepte in such wise / that
they lay as deed men on the earth / Then returned macrobyus and came and
slew them at his pleasure / for they had no might for to resist ne to do any
defense / Thus to speak morally the devil kylleth and sleeth all them which
he fyndeth a sleep in dedely sin / because they have no puyssau^ce for to
defend them self ne to resist to the devil of hell /

Meretricem fuge
tHou ought to flee the common and folysshe wymmen and the bawdes and their
decepcions / For they ben more subtyl than the devil / Item thou ought to
hold the by thy wife if thou be married / Saint Crisostom says that he is a
fool which leueth his good and true wife and holds other common wymmen in his
felawshyp / Peter alphons reherceth in his book / that in spain within the
cite of hyspalensy was a much fair and a good bourgeys wife and well beloved of
her husbond / It happed that a young clerk was enamowred of her / and many
times prayed and required her of love / but for no thing she would never
consent to hit / Then when the clerk saw that he was refused he entered in
to such a malencolye / that better he seemed to ^^e deed / then on live / but
nyghe his hows dwelled a maquerel or bawd which had great acquaintance with
the said bourgeyse / And when the said bawd knew that the said clerk was in
such point / she came for to speak with him and demanded of him what he
eyled and why he was in so great malencolye and comforted him and did so much
that she knew al his fayte / And in deed the clerk made bargeyn with the said
old bawd for to find the means that he might have his pleasure of the said
bourgeys wife and for to fulfylle his will and his entencion / This old bawd
had a little catte which she named pasquette the which she kept without any
mete or drink the space of three days / and after she gave to the catte a
little flesh with right strong mustard / and after she went for to speak
with the said bourgeys wife and led with her her little catte / but because
that she had eten the said mustard she did none other but wept ever / And
then the good wife demanded of the bawd why her catte wept and syghed so
sore / And she syghyng and weeping answered / Helas my lady / my catte which ye
see and I have cause enough for to weep / wherefore said the wife I pray you
that ye will tell to me the cause / Helas said the old bawd / my lady I dar
not tell hit to you Nevertheless the bourgeys wife prayed her so much / that
she told hit to her / saying madame sithe hit pleseth to you / I shall tell
hit to you / this catte which ye now see here is mine own daughter / the
which by the will and pleasure of god has been transfourmed in to a catte
because that a young man loved her / but never for no thing she would not
accord for to do his pleasure and will / wherefore the gods were wroth and
turned her in to a catte as ye may see / And therefore she wepeth thus
contynuelly / and when she wepeth I can not hold me but that I must weep / How
said the bourgeys wife ye say wonder / is hit truth that ye say / the which
swear that hit was very truth Helas / said the bourgeys wife which believed
lightly / know thou not such a young clerk / Yes my lady I know him full
well / Certeynly said the bourgeys wife he has prayed me of love / and has
offered to me many great yeftes / but never for no thing I ne would consent ne
grant his pleasure / wherefore as I suppose he is in great thought and
malencolye / and therefore if hit were sothe that thou say / I should be
turned in to a catte as thy daughter is / if the gods ben wroth with me /
Certeynly said the bawd if ye hold thus long the said clerk in that pain
and langour / ye are in great parelle for to be transformed from your fair
form / in to the likeness and form of a catte and ye shall therefore weep all the time of your life / Wherefore my dear lady I counceyl you / or the gods be
wroth upon you / that ye do after the will of the said clerk / For if ye
were turned in to a lityl catte ye should be dishonored and ye should be cause
of the shame and dyshonoure perpetuell of al your lynage / Thus the said
bourgeys wife which doubted the furour and wrath of the gods and the shame
and dishonor both of her self and of her parents / byleuyng the words of
the foresaid old bawd / consented within her heart to do the will and
pleasure of the said clerk / And then with great sygheng and malencolyes /
for doubt that wor^^ should come to her / said to the said old woman that she
would goo toward the said clerk and that she should tell to him that ^^e would
come for to speak with her / and that of her he should have his pleasure / Then
was the old bawd ioyeful and glad / and after went to the said clerk and
said to him that he should make good chere / and that Incontynente he should goo
toward the bourgeys wife / and that of her he should have all that should please to
him / The which clerk went Incontinent thither and paid the bawd as he had
promised to her / And thus he had his will of the said bourgeys wife /

Vino te tempera
tHou ought to be temperate in drynkyng wine / that is to say that men
ought to drink as much as it suffyseth to nature / and no more / Aristotel
says in his secrets which he sent to alixaunder / that many euylles sourden
and come by ouermoche drynkyng of wine / The first evil (...) because that hit
troubles both the wit and the memory / The second is for hit empessheth
the wit of nature The third is because that hit troubles the brain / The
fourth is because that hit debyliteth and makes feeble the virtues of the man /
The fyfthe is because that hit causes for to forgete that / that men have for
to do / The vj because that he causes evil appetyte / The seventh because
that hit makes the members to shake / The viij because that hit chaseth all
the body and engenders hete in to the lyuere / and causes evil blood and
generally hit makes feeble all the virtues both of the body and of the soul
/

Men read of an hermyte which oftentimes was tempted for to leave his hermytage
and return in to the world / to whom an aungel of god apperyd and said to him
if he would return in to the world that he might not escape but that emonge all the other evil sins which ben done in the same world there were three of the
which he should do one / that is to wete auaryce lecherye and drunkenness /
and that he should chese which of them three he would do / Then the hermyte
answered and said sithe that it is force that I fall in one of thoos three
sins / I chese drunkenness / and not Auaryce because that avarice is cause
and the root of all sins / Ne lecherye because that hit destroys all the
body of the man / And thus the myschaunte returned in to the world the which
drunk on a day so much of wine that he was drunk / and forthwyth tempted he
was of lecherye the which sin he made in deed / and after he became
auaricious / and in deed he set him self for to stele / and thus he made all
the said three dedely sins / and this came of dronkenesse only /

Nil arbitrio feceris
tHou ought not to do no thing of thyn own arbytre / that is to wete
without counceyl of sum more wise than thy self / And thou ne ought not to
trust thyn own counceyl ne by strength corporell and spyrituel ne also thy
wysdom and conuyng / but thou ought to take and require the counceyl of
other / and of the sages and show unto them the thing which thou purposest
for to do / For many to gyder seen more clearly and known more then does
one allonelye /

Pacienter parents vince
tHOu ought to overcome and vaynquysshe thy parents / by fair and sweet
words without making force or to be rebelle against hem / because that hit is
o^^e of the pryncypal commandments of our law / that men ought to obey
his fader and mother /

Patere legem quam tu ipse feceris
tHou ought to keep the law which thou have ordained and made / That is to
say that al tho which made the laws and that makes hem day by day ought to
keep them and to command the other for to keep them / Valere recounteth in
his syxte book / of a man which made an edycte that who someuer were taken in
aduoultrye he should l^^se both his eyes / It happed that the sone of him that
had made this edicte was taken in to aduoultrye / wherefore his fader commanded
that his two eyes should be taken out of his heed / but the bourgeys and the
lords of the cite prayed for him / then that he should have grace / but his
fader for no thing would not consent to hit / For he would make equity and
Justice and keep the law which he had ordained but for to plese the lords
and all the people he ordained that he him self should lose one eye / and his
sone another eye / to ^^hende that his sone should not lose all his syghte /
and also that the law should be kept and Justice observed /

Noli concupissere alienum
THou ought not to be couetyse of sum others goods / For it is against
one of the commandments of our law / Tulle says that none ought not to
deem the rychesses to be his own ne for him self only / But all way the
rychesses been and ought for to be pryncypally for the common well and prouffyte
of euerychone /

Illud stude agere quod bonum est
THou ought to study for to do that / that is good and nedeful vtyle and
prouffytable to the body and to the soul / Saint Ysodore says / that for to
do an evil / men loses many goods / For by one sin / many Iustyses been
subverted and lost / Likewise by one evil been many goodis subverted and
lost / Therefore ought thou to put pain and dylygence for to do ever well /
We reden of a king which had three sons / which king at the end of his
days made his testamente in this manner and form / that is to wete / that
the most sloutheful of his three sons should be his heir / Then each of
them / to the end that they might come to the herytege beforesayd / said that
he was most slouthful / The first said (...) was so slouthful / that if he
were set so nyghe to the fire that his legs should brenne / yet he would not
rise / The second said that he was so slouthful / that if he had the cord
about his neck for to be hanged / and in his hand a good knyf well sharp /
he would not cut the cord / The third said that if he were in a good bed /
and that the rain fyl contynuelly upon his two eyes / he would not rise ne meue
him neither to the lift ne to the right side therefore / and to this last yaue
the king his heritage and Iuged and held him for the most slouthful of his
three sons / To speak morally who this king is / It is to vnderstonden the
devil of hell / the which is king and prince of all slothful folk / By
the first sone ben vnderstonden them which been in evil and wicked company /
the which have lever for to be burnt of the fire of sin / that they lain in
/ than for to leave their evil felawshyp / By the second are vnderstonden them
that been in dedely sin / For how be it that they ben bound by the neck
with the strenges or cords of the devil / that is to wete with sins / and
condemned to d^^th and to be hanged on the galowes of hell / Nevertheless
they ben so slouthful and neglygent / that they will not cut the cord with
their knyf which is sharp enough / that is to wete with their tongue by very
and pure confession / By the third are vnderstonden / them which daily here
speak of the pains of hell and of purgatory / and of the joy of paradyse
and of all vices and sins and of confession / and how men ought to shryuen
hem self / But all ways they been so wonder negligente / that they can not
confess them self ne have and put them out of sin which is at the lift
side / for to eschew the pains of hell / Ne for to goo to the right side /
that is by very contrycion and repentance / for to get the glory of
paradyse /

Libenter ferto amore
THou ought to bear and have love to every man That is to say that thou
ought to govern thy self in such manner with all manner of persons with whom
thou conuersest / that thou may have their grace and love And also thou must
keep thy self to do any thing contrary to frendshyp / by the which thou
myghtest l^^se their l^^ue and be Indaygned of them /

Si deus est animus nobis vt carmina dicunt / Hic tibi praecipue sit pura mente
colendus /
THe first commandment of the first party metrycall is / that thou ought
to worship and believe one only god in essence / the which has might and
preemynence upon all things vysyble and vnuysyble / and he is end and
beginning of all things / As says Salamon / He governs all things by
weyghte and by ^^sure / and by his deuyne and excellent grace he is cause that
we been fourmed and created to his semblaunce and figure / For if he were not /
and if he governed us not all nature and kind should return to naught / as
of naught hit was made / And for to believe this / reason techeth us the songs
and dytees of the saints and of the holy appostles and prophets / As hit
appears clearly in the three credes the which our mother holy church syngeth /
that is to wete in the creed of the appostles / and in the creed which is
songen at the mass / and in the creed which is contained in the psalm of
Quicunque vult saluus esse etc^ / Wherefore now without any more taryeng every
one ought to worship and adoure him in very and steadfast feyth and believe
without any fy^^cions or corrumpcions / by pure devout and clean thought
because that he is above all other creatures one only god eternal end and
beginning of all thing / In that time that the wise Platon lived reigned a
great pestylence so horrible that the folk deyed suddenly / Then when
Platon saw that there reigned such a cruel ^^estylence / he did so much by
his subtyltee and science that he knew the cause whereof came this pestylence
and mortalytee the which did do make a great glass / and after he made hit
to be borne upon an high mountayn / and looked well often in to the said glass in
such manner that he knew and perceived the cause of the said pestylence / For
he saw a great multitude of people which lepte out of the cite which deyed
and fyl suddenly to therthe deed / Yet ageyn he looked in to the glass and saw
in two great valeyes / which were on both sides of the mou^teyn a great
multitude of dragons upon the roches of the said valeyes / which beholden each
other and whystled and blowed much wonderly / And thus Platon perceived and
knew clearly that the pestylence came by the whystelyng and soufflement of the
said dragons which corrumped the air / wherefore the people ^^yed suddenly / To
the which thing the said Platon found a remedy / for he did do make great
fyres in the said valeyes in such manner that the said dragons or serpents
were constrained to lepe within the fire and brenne them self / And thus was
the cite kept and preserved of the pestylence / To speak now morally in the
time of platon / that is to wete that time in the which reigned saint Peter
and the other appostles apperyd to holy church one so great a multitude of
dragons that is to wete / of heretykes and mysbyleuers / the which by their
soufflemens or blowynges and false doctrynes which they preached ageynste the
euangeles and against the feythe which Ihesu christ had yeuen and left unto
us / and specially against the articles of the feythe / and sown many errors
for to have brought the people of christ unto mysbeleue / But the very and
true platon saint Peter and the other appostles came / which have yeuen to us
a much fair glass within the which been put and seen all the artycles of our
feythe / And in hit we ought to look often times and believe stedfastlye upon
pain to be burnt within the fire and valeye of hell / As were the dragons by
the which artycles been confounded and destroyed the errors of the ancient
heresies /

Plus vigila semper ne sompno deditus esto Nam diuturna quies vicijs alimenta
ministrat
THou ought to watch in good werkys and flee slothfulness / which is
mother and nourice of all sins / For by ouerlonge rest and ociosyte been
gendred or gotten pryncypally three great sins / that is to wete auaryce
lecherye and ouermoche talkyng / We reden in one hystorye of greece / of a man
which found a another man all naked within a deserte or wode / the which man
fled as soon as he saw him come / But he ran so long after him that at
the last he ouertoke him / And then when that this naked man saw that he
might no more flee / he abode still / and the other demanded of him why he did
run so long before him / The which answered to him / that in his land was a
king which had a toure full of gold and silver the which toure the king made
to be kept meruaylously / For hit was dedicted in such manner / that as long
as he that kept hit watched that none might not enter in to hit for to rob
the said tresour / but as soon as he slepte every man might enter in to hit and
rob what he would / But for to eschew the ^^ungers and parellis of the said
toure to the end that he might not lose his tresoure / he gave every night to
him that would watch hit a precious stone which had such properte and virtue
that who sommeuer had hit in his hand he might not sleep But as soon as the
stone fyl from his hand / he forthwyth began to sleep / Then the said king
did do make a cry upon pain to lose the heed / that he which should keep his
toure / should not let fall from his hand the said stone / to the end that he
should not sleep and that he should not lose his tresoure / Then happed that on
a night I was committed for to keep the said tresour and for to watch within
the said toure / but I let fall the said stone out of mine hand / and
Incontinent I began toslepe / and while that I slepte the tresour of the said
king was robbed / Wherefore feryng the punycion and sentence of the said king I
am fled and come in to this deserte as thou see / To speak morally by the
same king is vnderstonden god the fader / which is king of kings and lord
of all lords / By the toure and tresoure thou ought to understand the
humayn man in to the which god has put a much great tresoure of all gra^^s
and virtues / By him that kept and watched the sa^^d toure is to be
vnderstonden the reason and wit of the man / For while that reason watches
in the man / It is Impossyble that the vices and sins enter within the toure
/ that is to wete in to the man / but as soon as reason slepeth and wit
fails / the vices and sins entren in to the toure / That is to wete within
the man and robben and putten to naught the tresoure of the king that is to
wete the virtues of the man / Therefore he is put and condemned to be in the
deserte unto the time that he shall have made satisfaccion / And therefore hit
appears clearly that every man ought to watch in good works / By the
precious stone is vnderstonden Ihesu christ / which keeps us fro sleep of
sin when we have in our memory his blessed passion

Virtutem primam esse puto compescere linguam Proximus ille deo qui sit racione
tacere
THou ought to be stylle and speak by reason and mesure in time and place
couenable / For he which can keep his pees and speak by reason and mesure / is
byloued of god / because that it is the first and pryncypall virtue that the
man may have for the great evil which folowen thereof / As the noyses and
dyscencions / which ben moeuyd emonge the folk of what someuer estate or
condycyon that they be of / Solomon says that who can keep his pees and speak
as time and place requires / he is right wise and next friend unto god /

It is read that the devil by the space of thyrty year and moo had assayed him
self for to have put dyscorde and noise between a merchant of clothe and his
wife / the which both were of right good living and loved well each other / the
which devil might not find the manner for to put and bring them to
dyscencion and dyfferente / Then the devil put him self in to the likeness
of a young man / and after he went on a way where as he well wist / passed by
often a bawd / and set him down under a tree much thoughtfull / tryste and
wooful by semblaunce / and held in his hand a pourse full of silver / And
after as the said bawd passed by the said way / she found the same young man
sittyng on the way / the which demanded of him whom he abode there and why
that he was so thoughtful and in so morning chere / The young man answered that
he should give her the purse full of silver which he held in his hand / if she
would swear and promytte to him to do that / that he should tell to her the
which swore and promytted to him that she should do all that he should
command to her / Then said to her the young man / I doubt said he much to
be punysshed in hell because that I have been thyrty year and more for to have
put dyscorde and stryf betwixt such a draper and his wife / And therefore I
give to the freely this purs if thou can put dyscencion between them / Then
this bawd took the purse and yede Incontinent for to speak to the wife of the
said draper and said thus to her / Helas lady I have great ruthe and compassyon
on you / For your husbond ^^s at mine hows and by his wickedness has done so
much that he has had the company of a young woman which dwells with me
and has promised to her for to give her a go^^ne clothe of the best and
fynest that is within his hows / Ha said the good bourgeyse I should not conne
believe hit for I have ever found him good and feythful / Certeynly said the
old bawd I have founden them in the deed doing / And to morrow ye shall see
the experyence of hit when she shall come fetch the clothe / And after the said
bawd went and spoke with the husbond of the said burgeyse and told him that
she had found his wife within the church spekyng with a clerk / And that she
understood of them that his wife would rob him / and goo both to gyder out of
the land Ha said the husbond I can not believe hit / For well I wot that my wife
is true and feythful unto me / Certeynly said she I ensure you that it is
truth / and in short time ye shall see them both spekyng to gyder / Then
went the old woman unto his hows and sent the young woman which dwelled in
her hows / for to bye clothe of the said draper / And when the drapers wife saw
her / she thought and believed that / that the old woman had told unto her
was true / wherefore she took so great malencolye that she could not sowpe for
woo / Whereof her husbond was much abashed For as then he had suspecyon on
her of that / that the bawd had told him / which on that other side began
for to make evil chere also / And on the morn next the old woman did so
much that the yo^ge clerk spoke with the said bourgeys wife seeing her husbond
which supposes to be troth that the old woman had told to him / And yet
ageyn the old bawd yede for to speak with the bourgeys wife and said to her
maystresse be you now certain of that / that I told you certeynly ye be lost
without ye put to hit remedy / Helas said the bourgeyse what remedy might I
put thereto / I shall tell hit to you said the old thoman / do so much that
this night ye have a rasere / and when he shall be laid in his bed and that
he shall sleep ye shall kutte three heeris of his berde and ye shall brenne them /
and after ye shall make him to ete them For after that he has eten them / he
shall never torn ageyn toward the said young woman / but shall hate her unto
death and yet he shall love you better then he did before / Certeynly said the
bourgeyse ye say right well / and I shall do as ye have said / And after this
the old woman yede for to speak ageyn to her husbond / to whom she said that
his wife would that same night goo with the said clerk / and that she would cut
his throat by night when he should sleep and how his wife had a raser for to
cut his throat therewith and how she should make him drunk / Then as they
had sowped the draper held the countenance of a dronken man and feigned him
self drunk and said that he would goo sleep and as soon as he was laid he made
semblaunte to sleep / And then his wife went and took the raser for to have
cut three heeris of his berde as the old woman had told to h^^r / but he
which slepte not took her by the hand upon the which she held the raser /
Then called he his servants and showed to them euydently how his wife would
kylle and put him to death / And the next morn he maunded and sent for her
parents friends and neighbors / and after said to them all the manner how she
would have cut his throat / the which wife as ouercomen and vaynquysshed could
not say one word / for she might not say the contrary / But there was a good
true man a chappelayn which did led her aside ^^th required to her that she
would tell to him all the pure truth of hit / And the woman reherced and
told unto him word by word how the old woman had counceylled her for to do
all that which ye have herd / And after he called the draper which also
told to him all his fayte / Then was the old woman sent fore / which was
peyned and constrained to say all the certeynte and the truth of all the
fayte / And after when they knew the great treson of the old bawd they were
friends and loved each other more than they did before / By this ensaumple
appears clearly that many euyls comen by wicked and evil tunges / and by evil
reports

Sperne repugnando tibi tu contrarius esse Conueniet nulli qui secum defidet
ipse
THou ought not to change thy counceyl when it is good and vtyle / Ne to be
contrary to thy self / For he which is contrary to him self shall not accord
with none other / And therefore thou ought to be steadfast and constaunt
within thy self wythouten mutacion contrary to reason and truth / It is
read in an hystorye of Rome / that an emperor of rome which was much
ancient or old / married him to a much fair queen / the which knew her
own cook in such manner that she had by him a child male / And the emperor
wenyng that it had been his sone / when the child was of age he betoke him to a
phylosophre / But sone after the emperor deyed / then the said phylosophre
consyderyng that he was old and nygh to his death / Also because that he knew
the condycions of the said child and young emperor / and who was his fader /
Reherced unto the said child his birth and who had begoten him saying in this
manner / know thou that thou art noble by thy moders side / and not by thy
faders side / For thou art sone of the cook of the Emperor / And because that
thou art of right noble blood by thy moders side thou take on the and
enchaunsest thy self for to do high and excellent prowesses and deeds whereof
thou becomest and wexest proud / and thou dyspreysest the dukes / earls and
barons of thy court wherefore they desire more thy death than thy life / Item on
the other party / because that thou art of vylayn blood by thy faders side /
thou set thy self to dyshoneste plays and (...) many vices / wherefore thou
art dyspreysed by the princes and barons / and thus as much of one party as
of the other thou might well lose thyn empire / But to the end that thou may
eschew the said vices and Inconuenyentes / I shall give to the a good doctrine
/ For from hens forthon thou shall do make to the a gown of two manner of
clothe / whereof the one part shall be of right fine clothe / and the other
part of right course clothe / to the end that when thou shall be tempted for
to do sum thing dyshoneste and foul / thou look on the half of thy gown
which is of so fine clothe / that is to wete that thou shall consydere how
thou art of noble blood by thy moders side / And thus thou shall chastyse the
by thyn own self / Semblably when thou wylt do high and excellent faytes or
deeds / look on the other part of thy gown which is of course and foul
clothe / that is to wete that thou must consydere and think how thou art
right foul by thy faders side / and thus thou shall keep thy self fro pride /
and thou shall be ever united within thy self / Ne thou shall never do no thing
contrary to thy self /

Si vitam inspicias hominum si denique mores Cum culpas alios nemo sine crimine
viuit
THou ought not for to Judge / to blame ne to dispreyse other / For when thou
blamest and dyspreysest the other / thou ought to think and consydere /
that none lives without blame / Wherefore thou must be first with out sin /
and virtuous / than for to will make the other to be virtuous and without sins
/ We reden in vitis patrum that saint moses the hermyte was chosen for to Judge
his brother / which was gylty / and in sin / the which Hermyte took a sack
full of grauel or sonde / and bare hit upon his back And when he was demanded
why he bare the said sack and what was therein / he answered that hit were his
sins the which men may not see / And yet this day said he I am chosen for to
Judge the sins of the other /

Que noscitura tenes quamuis sint cara relinque Vtilitas opibus preponi tempore
debent
THou ought to leave al thing which ben contrary to the / how be it that
they ben dear / precious and dylectable / For the vtilyte / that is to wete
worship and good renommee as well of the body as of the soul and life spirituel
ought for to be preferred before all the rychessys and al worldly plesures
which ben transitorye and sone passed / If thyn eye sclaunder or shame thy
self put hit fro the / For better is for to lose one eye / than the hole body /
We see by experyence / that when a dog bears a pyece of flessh / in his
mowthe / when he sees the shadow of the flesh that he bears and weneth to
take the shadow of the said pyece which is gretter than the pyece / he is
begyled for he fyndeth no thing / In like wise many one leave for to serve god
/ for to serve the vanytees and plesures of this World / Which ben but shadow
to the regard of the glory of paradyse / therefore we ought to leave them / for
they are to us chargeable and grievous / how be it / that they ben holden dear
and much delectables /

Constans et leuis vt res expostulat esto Temporibus mores sapiens sine crimine
mutat
THou ought to be constaunt and steadfast as much as the thing requires in
time and in place / as Well in prosperyte as in aduersite / For the sage may
and can change him self without any blame ne sin in time and in place / For
sometime of need he must be sweet and peasyble and sometime sharp and rygorous /
The constaunt and steadfast man geteth much of temp^^rall goods and of virtues
And by the contrary the man inconstant dyspendeth much goods and falls in
to many vices and sins / The sage says that diverse condycions been
answering to many one in diverse placys / and says that there is one time for
to speak and one time for to hold his pees / time to be borne / and time to be
nourisshed / time for to laughe / and time for to weep / Time for to set
trees and herbys / and time for to sow and heruest / Time for to spare and
time for to dyspende / Time of war / and time of pees / But in all times
thou ought to be steadfast and constaunt and not flyttyng /

Cumque mones aliquem nec se velit ipse moneri Si tibi sit carus noli desistere
ceptis
THou ought to resist and admoneste thy friend by sweet words and al other
persons / and when they will not chastyse them by thy words / thou ought
ever to persevere in gyuyng to them more and more good admonestement without
sessyng / specially when they be thy dear friends /

Contra verbosos noli contendere verbis Sermo datur cunctis animi sapiencia
paucis
THou ought not to strive ne take noise with them that been full of
superfluous words / and Injurious For the speech is given to every person /
but the science and connyng for to refrain and amodere his courage and his ire
is given to few folk / First none ought to take stryf with the noble man and
puyssaunt / because that sometime thou myghtest fall in to his danger /
Secondly with the rich man / because that thorugh the mean of his gold and
silver he might find the manner for to let and grieve the / Thyrdly with him
which is full of superfluous and Injurious words / because that thou may
have thereof no worship all be hit that thou had good cause and true / And
also against him which gladly takes stryf and noise with every man and
without reason / for by litel words men comen often unto great words of the
whic^^ sourden often great Inconuenyentes It is read in vitas Patrum / that an
holy man named macarye to whom was reveled and told by dyuyne will that
there were within a cytee which was nyghe his dwelling two wymmen and two
brethern / the which had never noise ne never stryf to gyder / neither in
word ne in deed nor in thought / To the which he yede for to see / as hit was
commanded to him in gods behalue / But as soon as the good wymmen saw this
holy hermyte / they began to cry with an high voys saying / Ha sir would to god
that hit were the pleasure of our husbondes that we might enter in to relygyon /
For this world is not plesaunt to us because of the noyses and stryues which
ben made in hit fro day to day / Then the holy fader comforted them and said
that they should persevere stylle as they were acustomed in good love and
dyleccion (...) long ^^s hit should please to god and to their husbonde

Dilige sic alios vt sis tibi carus amicus Sic bonus esto bonis ne te mala
dampna sequantur
THou ought to love every person / and fyr^^ ^^yn own self / For thou
ought in such man^^ (...) good toward every man / that none evil or (...)
m^^y come thereof to the / for the charity ought to begin at thy self /
Therefore says saint Austyn / that men ought to set and put order in charity
and in love / First men ought to love god for he is lord over us / Secondly our
soul and thought because that they ben emonge us Thyrdly our neighbors and
friends and the angels because that they been besides us / Also men ought to
love the things outward which are without / because that they ben by us of
the which we live corporally / The first token is for him which loves the /
hereth g^^adly to speak of the / The second for he speaks often and gladly of
the / The third for he thinks o^^tymes on the without to be weary of hit / The
fourth for he lays his body and his good in to danger to thy need The
fyfthe for he keeps me from dommage / The vj for he p^^aseth the harm and
offense that men have done to the / The seventh for he has joy of thy
prosperyte and good fortune / The viij because that he has joy to see the and
thy presence / The ix for he takes dysplesure for thyn absence / The x for he
loves that that thou love / and hates that which thou hate / The xj for
he peyneth him self for to do to the so^me pleasure / The xij for he doubts
to do to the any dysplesure The xiij for he takes pain on him for to bring
the other unto thy love / The xiiij for he keeps derely that / that thou
gyuest to him / The xv for he does that / that thou counceyllest to him / The
xvj for he trustely demands to the counceyl upon his deeds /

Rumores fuge ne incipias nouus auctor haberi Nam nulli tacuisse nocet / nocet
esse loqutum
THou ought not to entremete thy self / forto reherce tidings and lesynges
to the end that men say not that thou art an auctour and maker of lesynges
and of new tidings / For few words letten but few often / but ouermany
words letten full often / Therefore men must be stylle in pees / and speak When
need is / for over many words may not be without vices and sins / Item the
sage says that ouermoche speech is contrary to nature / because that nature
has ordained to us one mowthe and two eerys in betokenyng that we ought to
here twyes as much as we speak / For every man ought to be light to heeryng /
and slow to speak / Therefore said Socrates to a man that spoke ouermoche /
here me said he thou that have but one mowthe and two eerys by nature /
ought to here twyes so much / as that thou spekest /

Rem tibi promissam certam promittere noli Ram fides ideo quia multi multa
loquntur
THou ought not to promytte to none other / that thing which is promised
to the / to be sure and certain which by adventure is uncertain / and therefore
men ought not to believe ne adiouste feyth to the saying of many one / For many
one sayen oftymes the contrary of that / that they will do / Thus as thou
sholdest promytte to sum other to give to him ten flocyns / the which are
promised to the for certain / thou might be founden a liar / for he which
promised them to the for certain / by adventure he shall not do hit / And
therefore thou ought not to promise ne to assign sum other upon that /
that thou have not yet in deed / For he which lightly promytteth / is often
holden and founden for a liar / Men say comynly that he is a fool that
promytteth for to give the ele which he holds only / but by the tail
which may lightly escape fro him /

Cum te quis laudat iudex tuus esse memento Plus alijs de te quam tu tibi
credere noli
THou ought to be Judge of the praysyng which men (...) gyues to the / For
thou ought m^^re to believe thy self that knows the truth / than to
believe folysshly that / that other men saye^^ of the / as do^^e these flaterers
which will Impetre and have grace toward sum other by flaterye / After that
it is found in droyt canon / there is four manners of praysynges / First when
men attribueth to the / the good which thou have not / Secondly when men
enhaunceth ouermoche the good which thou have not / Thyrdly when men reproves
the evil which thou have and that is known in the / And also when sum other
lies wylfully for to please the / Item for four things thou ought not to
believe these flaterers / The first is because that they be like to hunters and
to them that take birds which will take them with their grynnes and sweet
words / The second because that they ben like to the marmayde which causes
the maryners for to sleep / and after makes them to be perisshed / thus done
the flaterers by their sweet words / and after make the for to fall in to
many vices and sins / The third for they been like to the scorpyon and to the
honey fly / the which enoynten before and prycken hard behind / The fourth
because that they been like rubbers which rubken the wild oxen for to take
them / For they rubben and clawe their heedes / to the end that they may take
and led them to their death / wherefore thou ought to fle al such
decepcions which are founded on sweet words dysceyuable /

Officium alterius / multis narrare memento Atque alijs cum tu benefeceris /
ipse sileto
THou ought to reherce and tell unto many one the faytes and deeds of other
/ that is to wete the benefaytes that the other have done to the / to the end
that thou be not reputed and holden unkind / Of the good offices and benefyces
which men have done and given to the / But when thou shall do to sum other
sum good / thou ought to hold thy pees thereof / and to do them so
secretly that thy lift hand may not know that / that thy right hand does /
That is to say that thou ought for to do hit wythouten any ypocresye and
vaynglorye / because that the ypocrytes given more for to have preysyng of the
world / than for the love of god / Saint Austyn says that every creature ought
to preyse god and to render and yield him graces and thanks of all the goods
and benefaytes that he does and has done to him / And this is approved by the
four Elements First says the earth prayseth god / or else I shall swalowe
the within me / as I did dathan and abyron / The water says / preyse god or
else I shall drown the within me with the delycious folk full of vaynglorye /
as I did at the deluge of waters / The fire says praise god or else I shall
brenne the with them of sodom / The eyer says praise god / or else I shall
ouerblowe the with the Jews / that is to wete if thou render not graces and
thanks unto god of al his benefaytes /

Multorum cum facta senex et dicta ^^ecences Fac tibi succurrant iuuenis quia
feceris ipse
tHou ought to take ensaumple to the faytes and sayenges of thauncient /
which have been virtuous and of good and honest life / to the end that th^^u be
virtuous as they have been / for thou ought to govern thy self so wisely in
^^hy yongthe / that thou may have socour and help in thyn old age / for the
fair deeds / prouesses and virtues which thou shall have done in thy yongthe /
to the end that thou have thereof praysyng and prouffite both of god and of the
world / and also to thend^^ that thou be ensaumple to them that shall come after
the / We have an ensaumple of a prophet named eleazare which loved better to
deye / than for to do or consent to do against the law / to the end that every
man should take ensaumple to his great constaunce and steadfastness after his
death / because that he deyed for to hold and sustain the law and truth /
and said that none ought to glorefye him self of oldenesse of age without that
he have oldenesse of sapyence and of virtue /

Ne cures si quis tacito sermon loquatur Concius ipse sibi de se putat omnia
dici
tHou ought not to ca^^e if thou see sum folk spekyng secretly to gyder /
that is to wete when ^^hou art pure and clean without vice and without blame /
because that he which is gylty and full of vices and of sins wenyth that all that men say in secret / is of his fayte or deed / because that he is ever in
doubt and in remoxs of conscience / Saint Luc recounteth in his viij chappytre
of a Jew which said and supposed in him self / when marye magdalene wesshed
the feet of crist with her teris / and wyped them with her heerys / and thought
if such a man had been an holy prophet and an holy man / he had not suffered
that a sinner had touched him wherefore he had suspecion in his heart that Ihesu
Christ was a false prophet and an untrue / And for this cause we ought not to
have suspecyon upon other for so much that they speak secretly to gyder or do
so^me other thing secret / when we know nor understand not the cause why /
for rather we ought to think and suppose well than evil / for the doubtous
thing ought to be interpreted to the better party / and suppose rather and
sooner well than evil /

Cum fueris felix que sunt aduersa caueto Non eodem cursu respondet vltima
primis
tHou ought to doubt and flee fortune / how be it that thou be rich and
mighty of goods both temporal and spiritual / for in time of habundaunce men
have memory and mind of pouerte / but always thou must keep thy self for to
get ne withholde unjustly the richesses evil gotten / For much often the last
things been not like to the first / The whele of fortune waxes and waneth as
does the moon / For never hit holds not in one point / for Incontinent hit
changes fro prosperity in to aduersite / Therefore it is said that the last
thing resembles not by one like course to the first things / For fortune
holds her never in one point / Therefore says Boece of consolacion / that he
which falls is not steadfast / that is to say / that he which comes fro
prosperity in to aduersyte is not well happy /

Cum dubia and fragilis sit nobis vita tributa In mortem alterius spem tu tibi
ponere noli
tHou ought not to have hope in the death of other for to have his good after
his death / because that our life is freall / doubtous and right uncertain / For
as soon deyeth young as old / For men find at the markette hows moo skynnes of
calves / than of kyen / When the king alisaunder had won the battle against
the king of Perse / he returned to his palace ryal in babylonye / and as soon as he was set at table / a wild bird entered within the halle / which flewe
many times about the halle and after set and rested him on the table before
the Emperor / and there the bird leyed an egg and after hit flewe out of the
halle in to the feldes / Of the which egg issued Incontinent a little worm
which went round about the egg for to have entered ageyn in to hit / but he
could never find the hole where thorugh hit was issued / wherefore he deyed /
when the king alyxaunder saw this / he was much abashed / and as dremyng
thought all the night on hit / and supposed that it had been sum token of
treson / And yet on that same night a woman of the cite was delyuerd of a
child half man and half be / the which half humayn was deed / and the
other half be was on live / the which child was brought unto Alyxaunder
for to see / Whereof he was more abashed / than he had been before of the bird
/ then he made al his astrologiens to be gadred and assembled to gyder for to
know and Judge what the said thing betokened / The which were al of one
opinion that these wonders and meruayles betoken his death / Then one of them
spoke for all before Alyxaunder / and said that the egg which is round
betokened the world / and that the little worm betokenyd Alexaunder / For as
the litel worm might not return to the h^^le of the egg where thorugh he
came out of / Right so alixaunder which had won and subdued all the world
all about / should never return in to Greece out of which land he was
issued / and told and concluded before him / that the gods had ordained that
he should deye / And the forsaid astrologyen said the child which is half
deed and half on live / half man and half be betokens that now thou
art but half man / for thou art nygh to thy death / And thy successors shall
be like to living beestes / to the regard of the and of thy prouesses which
thou have done / Then when alyxaunder herd these tidings he lift up his
eyes toward heaven / and began to cry with an high voys / O my great and
souerayn god Iupyter I see now well that this world gives little gwerdon and
reward / helas I wend to have lived so long in this world thai I might have
accomplisshed al my will / and now I must deye / I know clearly that none
ought not to trust to long life in this world as I have done / nor having
hope on the death of other / as I have had hitherto /

Exiguum munus / cum det tibi pauper amicus Accipito placide plene / et laudare
memento
tHou ought to take with thank the little yefte of thy friend / For how be
hit that it is little / thou must take hit gladly / and hit ought to be to the
more agreeable and more plesaunt / than if a rich man had given it to the
Therefore when men given to the / thou ought not to have regard unto the
yefte if hit be little or great / but thou ought to have reward to the will
and affection of him that gives hit to the / and ought to take hit with good
heart and to remercye and thank plainly / for all be hit never so little / if
thou sholdest refuse hit / thou sholdest do to him that gives hit shame and
vergoyne / Q uintilianus reherceth of a pour man and of a rich man that
hadden two gardyns which gardyns were ioynyng to gyder / The pour man had in
his gardyn many honey flees or bees / and the rich had in his gardyn many fair
flowers / the which rich man made to tell to the pour man / that he was
evil apayed of his bees which came in to his gardyn to take the honey upon his
flowers / and the pour man made thereof no great care / but let his flees goo
as they were acustomed / Then when the rich man saw that he cared not / he
went and cast venym upon his flowers in such manner / that when the bees
set them upon the said flowers they were all poys^^ned and in parelle of
death / But the pour man which was a good medecyne / put so^me remedy to hit
/ and because that he wist well that the oil and the wine were contrary to
venym / he took two little vessels which he had al only and no more / and
filled that one with oil and the other with vynaygre / the vynaygre he cast
upon the flees / and with the oil he enoynted them / Morally to speak / by
this pour man which loved well derely his bees or flees / thou ougtest to
understand Ihesu Christ / And by the rich man the devil of hell / And by
the flees the men and wymmen of this world / For when the devil had poysonned
the men of this world by vices and sins and that they were condemned to the
death / Because that they had gadred and taken the honey from over the flowers /
that is to wete in carnalitees and in many vices delectables and sweet to the
person / as is the honey / Then Ih^u Crist the souerayn medecyne / took two
little vessels of oil and of vanaygre which he had only / that is to wete
that by his sorrowful and aygre or sour and bitter passion / bought and raised
us fro death unto life ageyn / and after he enoynted us of the oil / that is to
wete of the grace of the holy ghoost Certain every person may say / that hit
was a much precious yefte which our redemptour gave to us / when he did cast
and shed his precious blood upon his flees / that is (...) wete upon the
synnars / in byeng them ageyn from bitter death and enoynted them after of the
oil of mysericorde /

Infantem nudum cum te natura creauit Paupertatis onus pacienter far memento
tHou ought to suffer and bear pacyently the faytes and charges of pouerte /
because that nature has created the pourely and al naked out of thy moders
womb / for when thou came in to this world thou had naught / and w^^n thou
shall goo and leave hit / thou shall bear with the no thing Therefore says
Boece that we be borne all naked within the womb of our moders / and yet shall
we return al naked in to the womb of our mother / that is in to the earth /
Therefore ought thou to bear the faytes of pouerte patiently / the child
new borne and coming out of his moders womb makes th^^e things / first he
wepeth / And then he prophecyeth the euylles which he shall suffer in this
world / as long as he shall be on live / Secondly he puts his face toward
therthe / as a be in sign or token that he is compared to the dombe beestes
/ Thirdly for he holds the hand in his mouth in tokenyng that because of
the first sin of our first parents / he ought to suffer many pains in this
world / which sin they co^mysed or made by their mowthe in etyng the fruit
which was defended and forboden / Saint austyn recounteth in his book de
ciuitate / that sometime a man desired and had three goddesses to dinner / that is
to wete Juno goddess of myrthe and of might Pallas goddess of sapyence and
of wysedom / And venus goddess of love and of benyuolence / but because that
he bad not boden the goddess of dyscorde / she was therefore gretely wroth /
the which took an apple of gold / about the which was written / To the
fairest be hit given / And after cast hit in the myddel of the said goddesses
/ and as soon as they saw the apple each of them would have had hit / but for
to eschew their stryf and debate they ordained a Judge / that is to wete Paris
for to adiuge and give hit to the most fairest / the which Iuged and gave hit
to the goddess of love and benyuolence / as to the fairest To speak morally by
these three goddesses / are vnderstonden three times / that is to wete the time
of nature in which reigned much puyssaunce and might / For in time passed
reigned many geauntes strong and mighty / Item the time of the law written /
in which reigned much sapyence and wysedom / For the same time were founden
the sciences / Item also the time of grace and of love / that is to wete when
our lord descended in to this world / But the goddess of discord / that is to
wete the devil / cast the apple among the said goddessis / that is to wete
in this world / by slouthe / Nevertheless for the dyscorde that the devil put
betwyxte god and the man by sins / the sone of god which is the very apple
would descend in to this world within the goddess of love and benyuolence /
that is to wete within the precious womb of the vyrgyn marye / the which after
was borne al naked and pourely as the other men / and after received death and
passion and returned al naked there as he was comen fro / the which by his
worthy and precious passion boughte us ageyn from the peynes of hell /

Ne timeas illam quae vite est vltima finis Qui mortem metuit dum viuit perdit
idipsum
tHou ought not to doubt the death the which is end of this life / for who
that doubts hit / he falls all most in desperacion / and it is sign and
token that he evil and wickedly has led his life in this world / and that he
has not made satisfaccion ne penance of his sins / Seneque says that the
death is to us naturelle / and not paynefull / For because that we should deye
we are come in to this world This rule is given to every man / and approved of
every man / Therefore hit ought to be kept of all men wythouten doubtaunce /
We reden of an abbot named agatho / the which when he should deye / three days
before his death held his eyes open / without moeuyng of him self / Then the
brethern seeing this demanded and said to him / fader what do ye / and where
are ye / The which answered to them and said / before our lord abydyng his
Judgment / Then the brethern said to him / then fader doubt ye the death /
To whom he said / Notwythstondyng that all the days of my life I have to my
power kept all the commandments of god / Nevertheless I ne wot yet if I am
worthy to have the grace of god or not / For there is much great dyfference
betwyxte the Judgment of god and the Judgment of man / and said at the end /
Know ye that I doubt not the corporal death / but I doubt the death spirituel
/ They would yet have enterroged him but to them he said speak no more to me for
I am empesched and ocupyed and have much things to do / the which sone
after rendered and yielded his spyrite or soul /

Si tibi pro meritis nemo respondet amicus Incusare deum noli set te ipse
coherce
tHou ought not to blame god for as much as thou have no friends /
Notwithsto^dyng that thou have done many seruyces and much good to sum other
which known ne remembren hit not / and show them not to be thy friends / for
thou ought to refrain and amodere thy self / and not to speak folisshly in
sweryng and dyspytyng god / because that fortune and thy friends ben against
and contrary to the / But thou ought to say as the true man Job said / god
yaue hit to me / god has taken hit fro me / It is done as hit has pleased to
god / god be thanked of al / Latence recounteth an hystorye of the cite of rome
the which was in great pouerte by fortune of wars / but there was in the
said cite a noble Romayn which for the common well of the cite exposed and
dyspendyd all his richesse in such manner that for the common well he became
right power / It happed ones that he passed thorughe a deserte where he found
a colompne or pyler where upon was an image or statue which had one hand up
right showing toward a mou^tayn which was nygh thens / and the other hand
held on his side / But the said Romayn went nygh to the said image which he
beheld much well / Then when the son smote upon the sholders of the said
image / the shadow of the hand which was upright resplendysshed upon the
said mounteyn / And in deed the Romayn went toward the said mountayn for to see
what it was / that thymage showed with the hand / and there he found a yate
of iron which was shette / whereof he was much merueyled and thought in him
self to return toward the said image and supposed to find there the keye of
the yate of iron under the other hand of the said image / And as he had
thought and supposed he fond the keye under the said hand within a little yate
of iron / which keye he took and returned toward the mounteyn where he had
found the yate of iron / the which he opened and found therein a great
tresoure of the which he made rich both him self / and the cite also / And
thereof he rendered graces and thanks to god his creator and maker that had
given to him more goods than ever he had / had before /

Ne tibi quid desit quesitis vtere parce Vt que quod et serves semper tibi
deesse putato
tHou ought to dyspende thy gotten goods by mesure to the end that they
fail ne lack not in time to come / For thou ought ever to think that they
may fail to the within a little space of time / and that when thou had
lost them / thou had lost thy life and thy substance / Therefore thou
ought not to give them to thy friends nor dyspende them so largely / that
thou ne reteyne sum of hit for the time which is yet to come / That is to
say / to speak morally / that thou ought to govern thy self in such
manner in this world / that at the end thou may have the life eternal / and
to keep so well the commandments of god that at the end they lac^^e ne fail
not to the / for to have and get the life eternal / Men may use the goods of
this world unlawfully in three manners / First when one dyspendeth them Illicitly
and wylfully without cause / Secondly when men dyspenden them ouergladly and
haboundauntly / Thyrdly when men hold and keep them and use them auariciously
without departing of them to the pour people /

Quod prestare potes ne bis promiseris vlli Ne sis ventosus du^ vis bonus ipse
videri
tHou ought to give when thou may without promyttyng a thing twyes in
delayeng hit from day to day / For none ought to say one thing / and think
the contrary / to the end that he be not reputed and holden for a liar and
for a bygyler / specially when thou wylt be holden for a good man and a true /
and yet thou ought to put thy self in pain for to have good fame or renom
me / and good praysyng / Hit follows three evil pryncipalle / for to promytte
and not hold the promysse / First because that he to whom thou have promytted
to give a cexteyn sum of silver or other thing / at a certain day / trusts
thy words and holds him for sure to have at the said day / that which thou
have promytted to him / and upon that trust he may assygne and promytte the
said thing to another at the said day / And thus when thou faylest and
begylest him / he fails also to the other and he is reputed and holden for a
liar / and if thou had not promytted to him / he had pourueyed him self
else where / Secondly because that he falseth his feythe / and is reputed for
a begyler / Thyrdly because that men owe to the / therefore neither thank ne
grace when thou taryest to give ouerlonge therefore it is said who gives sone
gives twyes /

Qui similat verbis nec cord est fidus amicus Tu quoque fac simile / sic ars
deluditur art
tHou ought not to trust him that feyneth him self to be thy friend by
sweet words / and plesaunte without he be thy hertely friend / Therefore thou
ought to do to him like wise / that is to wete in showing thy self fayntly
to be his friend dyssymylyngly / and not h^^rtelye And thus one art and a
falseheed is vytupered and dysceyued / by another art and falsehede / or also
hit may be exposed / He that feyneth by sharp words rebukyng and chastysyng
thy vices and sins / to be thyn enemy / and in his heart he loves the /
trewely this is a very friend / Therefore thou ought to do to him like wise
in time and place as the ca^^s requires / And thus one art that is to Wete an
evil will and one evil purpoos / is reproved by another art / that is to wete
by good doctrine and enseygnement or techyng Men may keep feyth and love with
his friend in three manners First that thou dysceyue him not by sweet words
feyned plesaunt and dysceyuable / Secondly that for no thing thou tell nor
dyscouer his secret / Thirdly that thou leave him not in danger nor in
aduersite to thy power /

Nulli homines blando nimio sermon probare Fistula dulce canit volucrem dum
decipit anceps
tHou ought to approve ouermoche the men which speken swetely / For by
sweet words they dysceyue the / as he which takes birds does / which by
his sweet song and falseheed in countrefeytyng the voys of the bird /
dysceyueth hit and makes hit to fall in to his grynnes Seneque says that
flaterye reygneth thorugh all the world / and specially in the princes courts
and in the courts of the lords both spiritual and temporalle / It is read
of Saint Amkrose which reproved openly the Emperor of his sin / To whom
the Emperor answered / that he had founden a man of truth / But now this day
the princes and lords both of the church and seculers will not here ne
understand them which sayen truth to them / For he which can best flatere
them / is best loved of them /

Cum tibi sint nati nec opes tunc artibus illos Instrue quo possint inopem
deffendere vitam
tHou ought to do thy children to be learned and teched in sum art and
craft / whereby he may defend and eschew the life Indygent and miserable of
this world / specially when thou art pour / to the end that by pouerte thou
be not constreyned for to do sum thing whereof both thy self and thy
lygnage might receive blame and dishonor / For it is said comynly that craft
is bettre than the ydelnesse / ffor the good craft may not fail / but the
rychesses fail well / Polecratus recounteth / that the Emperor Octouyan how be
hit that he was rich and mighty / he made craft to be learned and taught to
his children / First he made his sons to exercise them and to be taught in
the fayte of arms and also in other arts and diverse crafts / to the end that
they might use their life by their art or craft if they had need in time to
come / Secondly he made his daughters to learn them for to work in wulle and
with the nedle / and to selle and to bye to the end that if their lyuelode
faylled to them / their craft might then help them for to eschew the power
and Indygent life of this world / For it is seen oftymes that they which have
grettest lyuelode and possessions / becomen and fallen in great pouerte / by
their evil and wicked rewle / or else by fortune / and because that they can
no craft ne no science they comen often in to many and great Inconuenyentes /

Quod vile est carum quod carum vile putato Sic tibi nec cuprous nec auarus
nosceris vlli
tHou ought to think that / that which is now foul shall be fair and dear
in time to come / And to the contrary / thou ought to think that / that
which is of present or now dear shall be lothely and foul in time to come /
Therefore thou ought to use hit in such manner / that thou be not reputed
and holden for auarycious ne hurter of thy self nor to other / Or also hit may
be exposed when sum gives to the a yefte which is foul and of little valor
/ thou ought to hold hit for dear / and thus thou shall not be holden for
unkind / nor auaricious ne covetous nor contrary to thy self ne to none other
/ Or otherwise hit may be exposed that / that which is foul in this world /
that is to wete pouertee / shall be dear in the other world before god And to
the contrary that / which is dear in this world / that is to wete richesse /
shall be foul and dysplesaunt to god in the other world / Joseph when he was
with the king of Egypt / by deuyne reuelacion was said to him / that it should
be seven year of dear time / And therefore he counceylled unto the king / that
while the corn was good chepe that he should make pourueaunce and store of hit
to the end that in time coming he might help with hit his pour people in time
of famyn or derthe / as thou have in the hystorye all alonge in the book of
Genesis /

Que culpare soles ta tu ne feceris ipse Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit
ipsum
tHou ought not to do the sins of the which thou wylt repreue and
chastyse the other to the end that with the same punycion that thou wylt
punysshe the other thou be not punysshed / For foul thing is to the techer or
doctor / wha n his own fawte and sin reproves him self / Therefore says
saint Austyn / that to speak well and to do evil is none other thing / than to
condemn him self with his own mowthe and word / For if thou wylt have the
little straw out of thy broders eye / take out the great balke which is in
thyn own eye / or else thou do great folly / Wherefore thou ought first
to reprove and chastyse thyn own self / and after thou may well reprove and
chastyse other /

Quod iustum est petito vel quod videatur honestu^ Nam stultum est petere quod
possit iure negari
tHou ought to demand the thing which is just true and lawful / to the
end that hit may not be denied ne wythsayed / for it is great folly to
demand or ask the thing / which may be lawfully and of right wythsayed
and refused / And thou ought to know that there been sum that sechen and
fynden / as they which vnderstonden that / that they demaunden and sechen /
Therefore says Ihesu criste seche ye and ye shall find / The other been which
seken and fynden no thing / As they which vnderstonden not that / that they
sechen / therefore says yet Ihesu christ / ye know nor understand not that /
that ye seken / The other been which seek not ne find not / as they that
vnderstonden no thing / But he that knows not shall be unknown / that is to
wete that he which shall forgete him self shall be foryeten / Before that thou
requyrest or make so^me petycions or demaundes / if thou wylt be herd and
enhaunced thou ought to consydere four things / First that he to whom thou
requyrest or make thy petycion / have might to give or to do the thing
which thou requyrest of him / Secondly that he which demands / be worthy
to have the thing which he demands / Thyrdly that thou have vtilitee and
prouffyte by the thing which thou requyrest / Fourthly that thy petycion or
askyng be true and reasonable / Men may lawfully require of our lord god three
things / First men may axe of god that which is nedeful to the life that is to
wete his norysshyng / as mete drink and clothyng which must be demanded by
reason and without excess / Secondly the conseruacion of his own body and of
his goods both temporalle and spiritual / Thyrdly to demand help and
socour of god in Just battle / as hit appears in the book of kings

Ignotum tu tibi noli preponere notis Cognita iudicio constant incognita casu
tHou ought not to hold ne approve the thing unknown to be true / before
the things which thou know true and lawful / For thou may do true
Judgment on the things which thou know / but of such that thou know
not / thou may not Judge but by adventure and hap / As when thou know a
good holy man / thou ought more to honor him and to have gretter trust in
him / then in him that thou know not / how be hit that he be good /
Therefore it is said comynly / that one ought not to reherce and utter his
counceyll nor goo in to the felawshyp of the unknown man / And that men ought
to love more the old friend approved / then the new friend which is not
approved nor assayed /

Cum dubia et incertis versetur vita periclis Pro lucro tibi pone diem
quicunque laboras
tHou ought to believe and to know for certain that thy life is doubtous / in
right great parelle and uncertain / For we ben uncertain of the hour of death
and of the fortunes which may come to us / And therefore we that been and
labouren in this perilous valeye ought to suffyse to us one day for all our
labor and salarye of all the time passed On the which day we ought to have
contricion and to make true confession of all our sins / A vysyon be fyl
sometime to a good holy man which was on the ryuage of the sea to whom seemed
and was aduys that the wawes of the sea would have covered and drowned him /
wherefore he ran hastily fro the ryuage / but as he ran he saw a great and
wonder horrible lion coming ageynste him for to devour and ete him / but for
dread he looked down to therthe and then he saw come before him a serpent
which cast fire and flame out of his mowthe / the which like wise would have
devoured him / Then when the good man saw that he might not escape he lift
up his eyes toward the heaven / and prayed god deuoutely that he would keep and
preserve him from this great parylle and danger / then he saw an aungel
from heaven which held with one hand a crown / And with the other hand he
held a sword / which aungel spoke to him and said / Ne doubt thou not / for
thou shall escape from all these parelles / if thou do that I shall tell to
the / First thou shall goo against the serpent hardely and shall put thy foot
within his throat / and sone he shall be deed / And after thou shall goo against
the lion / for he is not so strong as thou wenest / for he is right feeble /
and I promytte the / to give to the this crown if thou wylt do that I have
said / or else I shall slay the with this sword / To speak morally by the sea
is vnderstonden all the world which chaseth us by the vndes or wawes / that
is by dyue^^se temptacions / By the lion is vnderstonden the devil of ^^lle
which tempts us fro day to day / but he that will resysten against him he may
sone overcome and conquer him / By the serpent thou ought to understand
the flesh to whom thou ouhhtest to put thy foot within the throat / that is
to wete that thou must doubt and refrain hit by fasting and prayers And if
thou do hit not thus / the angel shall not give to the the crown which he
bears / but he shall slay the with his sword / and he shall let the fall
within the sea / that is to wete in to hell with them that been dampened /

Vincere cum possis interdum cede sodali Obsequio quoniam dulces retinentur
amici
tHou ought not alweye to vaynquysshe ne put under fe^^t thyn enemy / but
thou ought sometime to forgive and pardonne / though thou may vaynquysshe
and overcome / but by sweet and frendely words thou ought to refrain thy
self fro that / which thou myghtest well do / For by such service and
benefaytes thou shall mow hold and keep him for thy true and feythful friend
/ because that sweet and frendely words refraynen great ire / Item two
feythful friends ought to love each other parfytely and to be of one will /
For two dogs be stronger for to take a wulf then one dog allone / Thus
when two good friends ben well alyed to gyder / they be stronger and more
redoubted then one allone /

Ne dubites cum magna petas impendere parua Hijs etenim rebus coniungit gracia
caro^^
^Hou ought not to doubt ne to complain to give a little yefte to thy
friend / when thou doubtest not ne have no shame to demand of him a great
yefte / for by such things grace and frendshyp ioynen and bynden to gyder two
good friends and felawes / That is to say that men ought not to spare to give
worldly things that been little and foul for to acquyre and get therefore grace
frendshyp and benyuolence which are of great proufyte / and much to be
preysed / It is read of two felawes which loved each other much derely / of
the which the one Wrote all that his fellow gave to him / And in like wise the
other wrote all that he gave to his felawe / It happed then that they had
questyonned to gyder for to wete and know which of them two louyd most
parfytelye his felawe / he that had wryton all that his felawe had given to him
said that he loved more parfytelye by cause that when he ouersawe his book / he
remembered the fair yeftes which his felawe had given to him / the which
yeftes were cause that he never departed from the frendshyp and love of his
felawe / the other answered that he said well but yet said he / I have better
cause than thou have / For I ^^oke within my book wherein I have wryton the
yeftes which I have given to the / to the end that they be cause to hold the
ever in parfyte love and frendshyy / the which two felawes of their questyon
made Judge a sage and wise prophet / which Iuged that he loved more parfyte
which did write that that he gafe to his felawe / Morally to speak our Lord
has given to us many yeftes / not for to reproach them unto us / but to the end
that be lose us not lyghtelye he writes and enters them in to his book / that
is to wete within his thout for if we leave him not he shall not leave us / Item
at the other side we ought to write within our consciences the yeftes and
benefaytes which he gives to us and has given / and to study and read them
often / to the end that we may have his glory and benediccion at the end of
our days /

Litem infer cave cu^ quo tibi gra^ iuncta est Ira odium generat concordia
nutrit amorem
THou ought not to take noise ne debate with him Which thou love / and of
whom thou art in grace / Ne also with none other person for / ire and hate
eng^^dren many Inconuenyentes and dyscencions / but concord and pees
engenders love and dyleccion / after right canon men ought to flee and eschew
noyses and brawlyng for five causes / the first is by cause that he which
gladly takes noise and debate is customed to be arrogaunte and despytous / The
Second by cause that he is acustomed to be a flaterer / The third by cause that
he is acustomed to be false and traitor / the fourth by cause that he is
acustomed to be false and full of challenge The fyfthe because that he is
acustomed to dyspreyse gladly and to make noise and debate /

Seruorum ob culpam cum te dolor vrget in iram Ipse tibi moderare tuis vt
parcere possis
THou ought not to correct and chastyse thy servants when thou art
wroth and filled of ire / (...) be it that they be gylty and culpable / but
thou ought to forbere and attempre thy self unto the time that thyn ire be
passyd / by cause that if thou reprendred and chastysed them when thou art
wroth / thou myghtest chastyse them without mesure and dysordynatlye /
Therefore Seneques Would never chastyse his servants when he was wroth / but
held the hand vpryghte upon them wythouten smytyng unto time that his ire and
wrath were gone and passed / and said if I chastysed them when I am Wroth / I
should slay them / but when I have attemperyd mine ire I chastyse them by mesure
/ The wise man says / that he is a fool which sone Iugeth after his ire / and
that he which can refrain and amodere his ire is right sage and wise /

Que superare potes nondum vince ferendo Maxima etenim morum est semper
paciencia virtus
THou ought to forbere and spare sometime them that thou may vynquysshe and
overcome / For pacyence is the grettest virtue of all virtues of good
condycyon^^ / By cause that by the name of pacyence all the other virtues
taken force / vygour and attemperaunce / Therefore says the proverb / that
virtue is wydowe when she is not a^^urned confermyd and attemperyd with pacyence
/ by cause that all the other virtues rewlen and ordeynen them by pacyence /
for pacyence vaynquyssheth all /

Conserua pocius que sunt iam parta labor Cum labor in dampno est crescit
mortalis egestas
THou ought to keep and spare that / which thou have acquyred and gotten
with great pain and with great swette of thy body / and more moderatelye thou
ought to dyspende hit / than that which comes of advantage and withouten
pain and trauaylle / For every one doubts the pain and labor that men
have for to get them Item also naturally every man keeps and loves better
that which he acquyreth with pain and great trauaylle / then that which
comes of advantage / For when one dyspende^^h that which is gotten with great
labor / he falls to great pouerte and dommage and in to mortal Indygence /
which grown and encreaceth from day to day / We reden of two hosemakers of
the which the one was pour and had so great famylle or meyne / that his
craft might not govern ne sustain his household ne to furnysshe the expenses
/ the which as a wise man put him self to serve god contynuelly / and herd
mass every day without faylle / and thus by the grace of god / had ever of
worldly goods enough for to hold and sustain his estate with / But the other
which was more rich than he was / wrought both on sondayes and holidays /
the which by punycyon of god fyl in to great Indygence and pouerte / and in
deed / by great ire / as al wroth said to his neighbor / how farest thou / and
how goes thy fayte / thou werkest not the half of the time / but always thou
lyuest and farest more largely / and have more of worldly goods tha^ I have
that work both holydayee and sondayes contynuelly The which answered to him
that he had found a tresoure in the earth of the which he was wexen rich /
and that if he would do as he did / of all that they should find he should have
his part / which accorded thereto and went every day to the church as did
his neighbor / and sone he had of worldly goods enough when he began to
serve and to love god / Therefore says the gospel / seche ye first the kingdom
of god / and all things shall come to your behoufe (...) haboundaunce largelye
/

Dapsilis interdum notis et caris amicis Cum fueris felix semper tibi proximus
esto
THou ought to give and to be large sometime unto thy dear friends / and to
show thy self humble and benygne toward them / but always thou ought first
to help thy self / For as says the appostle none ought to hate his flesh
ne his person / charity begins at him self and after to his parents and to
the other who has the might and puyssaunce / Men may compare the rich man to
the hen / by cause that the hen takes so great curyosyte to nowrysshe her
chyckyns / that often she forbereth etyng for their sake / in so much that she
wexyth all lene / but when the chyckens are great they remembren them not of
hit / for they know her no more ne setten naught by her / Semblably when the
rich man has nowrisshed his children in their yongthe well derely and has
often foboren mete and drink for to gadre and assemble goods for them / when
they are great and out of the danger of their fader and mother they remembren
hit not / and setten naught by them / Therefore I counceyl the when thou art
rich and mighty that thou ne give ne distrybue thy goods to thy children ne
to thy parents and friends without thou have first purueyed unto thy self /
That is to say that thou reteygne and hold so largely of thy goods that hit
may suffyse for to help thy body / and specyalle thy soul /

Incipit liber secundus
Telluris si forte velis cognoscere cultus Virgilium legito / quod si mage
nosce laboras
IF thou will know the cultyuyng and eeryng of the earth and how men ought
to labor and make hit clean / and when men must sow and gadre again thou
must read the poet vyrgylle / for in his book thou shall find the manner for
to cultyue and labor the earth / and by cause that by such labor men get
and acquyre many great rychesses / the au^cyentes dyte put their cure and
study for to labor and cultyue the earth / but this oppynyon is false / for
the souerayn good of this World is to serve and love god

Herbarum vires macer tibi carmina dicet
IF thou will know the force and virtue of herbs / thou must read this poet
macer / the auncientes said that the souerayn Well of this world was in the
health of the body / and therefore they put al their wit and study for to
know the proprete and virtue of the herbs by cause that they ben ordained for
the health of the body / the which oppynyon is false /

Si romana cupis et punica noscere bella Lucanum queras qui martis prelia dicet
IF thou will know the bataylles of rome and of affrique read this poet
named lucan / the auncyentes said that the souerayn well of this world was in
getyng of good fame and renome of noblesse / and therefore they did put all
their estudye for to know the faytes or deeds of thauncientes And specially of
^^heym of Rome and of Auffryque / the which have been much subtylle upon the
fayte and deed of werre /

Si quid amare libet vel discere amare legendo, Nazonem petito / Sinautem tibi
cura hec est
IF thou will love and have a paramour / read thou the poet named nazo the
lechoure / thauncyen supposed that the souerayn good of this world had been in
plesures and worldely delectacyons / And therfor^^ ^^tudyed and learned this
poet Nazo / which techeth the (...) and manner for to love paramours /

Vt sapiens viuas audi que discere possis Per que semotum vicijs deducitur cuum
Ergo ades et que sit sapiencia disce legendo
IF thou will live wisely / flee the vices / and follow the virtues / the
which putten al vices and sins out of the person / Item thou ought to
read and study in such manner that thou may become sage and wise and to
acquyre sapyence and wysdom / and to flee the false opynyons and errors of
thau^cient beforesayd in the iiij precedent commandments /

Si potes ignotis eciam prodesse memento Vtilius regno est meritis acquirere
amicos
TThou ought to do well and to do prouffyte to the strangers / and not al
only to thy parents and friends / For it is more vtyle and profitable for
to acquyre a friend by thy labor and good deeds / than for to acquyre a royame
or sum great tresour / salamon says that better is to acquyre ^^ good name
and good grace / than gold or silver / Therefore (...) tullius that there nys
cite ne castle that may long endure with outen frendshyp and concord / God
makes rain to fall / both upon the good folks / and upon evil folk /
wherefore thou ought not al only to love the good people / But also sometime
the evil folks / and to teache and enduce them to do well and to give and help
them at their need / myseryes and aduersytees /

Mitte archana dei, celum que inquirere quid fit Cum sis mortalis que sunt
mortalia cura
THou ought not to inquire ne know the secrets of god nor what thing is
the heaven / that is for to wete of such secrets that humayne nature may not
attain know ne understand / But thou must believe stedfastlye without any
doubt that / that the church byleuyth and holds for true / And by cause
that thou art mortalle / thou ought to inquire of the mortalle or dedelye
things and not of the deuyne and Inmortal things / Therefore says the
appostle that there is none eye that has seen Ne eere that ever herd / ne
heart that thought nor can think / the goods which god has maad ready and
ordained for them which are of good love and true believe / For he which
eteth ouermoche of honey / hit lets him / like wise he that ouermoche
enquyreth of the secrets of god more then nature humayne ne may ne ought to
know ne understand shall be oppressyd before god and pryued fro his glory /
To this questyon men may answer by two exaumples / First it is read of a
prophet which studied long for to know the nature and kind of the bees or
honey flees / but he could never find ne know hit / Item Tulles recounteth in
his book / that he made of the nature and kind of the gods / that a king
demanded of a prohete what thing was god / Then the prophet demanded
term and space for to answer to the said questyon / And the king gafe him
term of three days / Item after that the three days were passed the prophet
demanded yet longer term / unto whom the king gafe only three days / Item
after the three days he would have had yet gretter term Ha said then the king
I see well that thou mocquest me / But the prophet escused him self gracyously
and said that he mocqued not / but he said / I consydere and suppose that god
is so over souerayn and incomparable and unlike / For the more I think on him
/ the more I am confused and abashed and wot not what I should say / and by
no manner I ne may know what thing is god / And now answers the prophet to
the questyon pryncypal / and says that a maker of erthen pottes may make of
one earth a pot to his worship / and another of like earth to his dysworshyp
/ Item saint austyn says that god has made to be borne the evil and wicked
folk for four reasons / The first is that by cause of them the good folk
seem the better / as the white breed seems to be better and fayrer by the
black and broune breed / The second is by cause that the Justice of god is
approved and enhaunced by the evil folk / For he is so full of myserycorde that
all the world should be saved / if his Justice showed and apperyd not / and if a
Judge should pardonne and forgive al / he should not seem to be Just / and by the
contrary if he never pardonned nor forgafe he should not seem to be
myserycordyous ne mercyful / The third is for the evil and wicked folk / the
good are worshypped and therefore is to them / ready made / gretter gwerdon or
reward / Item if there had be no wicked folk / our Lord had not taken death
/ Ne saint stephen had not be cast with stones / ne no marter crowned / The
fourth is by cause that of the evil and wicked folk have been borne and begoten
more saints then of the other / For of Esau which was right wicked and evil
man / and of achab was engendered or begoten ezechyas and thus of many other /
Item out of the thorn grows the rose / and if men did cut and destroy all the thorn trees there should no roses grow no more / and thus by the thing
beforesayd apperith clerel^y that god has made the Wicked and evil folk for
to have and get unto him the good and feythful people / and for to show his
myserycorde and his Justice / Now then sythen it is so as I have said to the
and approuyd that none may know the secrets of god / How might men know that
/ that he will do / ne the cause why he did all that he has done /
Notwythstondyng that saint austyn and many other / as I have said have given
and shown of hit many natural reasons / And therefore thou ought not to
inquire of the secrets of god no ferther then nature humayn may know and
understand / The doctors been of oppynyon and sayen that the prescyence of
god bears ne wythholdeth nothing of need / but that it may befalle otherwise
/ And this approves boece of consolacion by reasons and ensaumples First he
says that god knows sum things nedefully and naturelly for to come / as
he knows of need that the son ryseth in the morning / Item he knows
sum things of free and lyberalle arbytre / for he knows well when so^me will
do sum thing / and that has his free will and lyberalle arbytre for to do
hit or not / Therefore the man does naturally that / that he does / For thus
has god Instytued and ordained hit / Item the son ryseth of need / by cause
that god ordained hit so / and thus the things which ought for to come
naturelly been nedeful / but they that comen by lyberal arbytre / ben free to
do hit or not / For thus has god ordained Instytued and forseen / Item hit
may be proved by ensaumple that the deuyne prescyence of god wytholdeth ne
bears no need / Now suppose we that in sum place is a way which is devised
in three ways / thorugh which way a man must pass / Item let us suppose that
another man is high upon a montaygne which knows all things that are to
come / the which cries with an high voys unto him that should pass by the
way devised in three ways / and said / I deffende the that thou ne pass
thorugh the lift way but by the right way / or at the least by the myddel
way / if this man set ne retche not of his saying / but goes thorugh the
lift way and falls in to the hands of his enemies / what may do thereto the
man which was upon the montaygne which knew well al things that were to come
/ and that forbode and deffended to him that he should not pass by the lift
way / None is then cause of his harm and evil but he allone / sithe that he
had his lyberalle arbytre and free will for to have passed by such a way as
hit pleasyd to him / and also when hit was forboden and deffended to him / he
ought not to have passed thorugh hit / but ought to have passed by the right
way / or ellis by the myddel way And thus hit apperith that the deuyne
prescyence of god bears ne wytholdeth none of the things that are for to come
/ and of which men have lyberalle and free will for to do them or not /
Item there been sum prophets which sayen that the man which is borne in a
good planette or sign / shall be well fortuned / and if he be borne in an evil
planette he shall be evil fortuned / This error repreueth saint gregory in his
om^^ye / and says that many ben borne in this world in one like sign and
planette / and in one like point / of the which sum ben kings or dukes /
and the other are puttyers and right wicked and evil / To this answeren the
said prophets and sayen / that the point is passed in a twynklyng of an eye /
Saint gregory says and answers that how be it / that hit be so / that the
point is passed in a twynklyng of an eye / Nevertheless it is impossible to
be borne in the same point and within so short a space of time / For men seen
by experyence / that when a child is to be borne many points may pass or
he be borne / Therefore says saint gregory that this may not be true / For if
the constellacyon were nedeful cause to have we^^ / or evil / or to be dampened
/ or saved / the man might escuse him self of his sin before god saying /
Sir creator or maker of al things ye have given to the same planette on the
which I was borne / such a propretee that she has constreyned me for to do
such a sin / to the which I may not resyste / And as says saint austyn /
sin is wylleful / For that which is done ageynste his will and by force is
not sin / Wherefore me seems that I ought for to be escused of the sin
which I have done ageynste mine own will / and by the Influence of the sign
and planette on which I am borne / the which constreyneth me for to do all
that I do / This oppynyon and error is the werste of all the other
beforesayd / For if hit were so that al things were ordained of god / that hit
might none otherwise be / hit should follow thereof many Inconuenyentes / First
by cause that sin shol^d not be sin / for his sin by the ordenaunce of
god were then nedeful and necessary thing / and thus god should have no
cause for to punysshe the synnars / Item also well were not well / Item god
should have no Justice / for hit should be quenchyd and set as naught / by
cause that there should be neither paradyse nor hell / Item men should not
retche of no temporalle thing / ne should have no need to labor and cultyue
the earth / Ne for to hold no fayres / ne to make any marchaundyses / Ne also
should not need to take no medecynes sithe that al were ordained and predestyned
when men should deye / Thus men might say that he which should be dampened be
deuyne predestynacyon / might not be saved in doing after his lyberalle arbytre
and free will / For all should be of need and necessary /

Linque metum leti na^ stultum est tempore in omni Dum mortem metuis. amittis
gaudia vite
THou ought to believe and not to doubt all only the bodily death / by
cause that in all times is folly to doubt the death / for when thou doubtest
the death thou lesest the joy of thy life / nevertheless thou ought to
doubt and often to think of the spyrytual death for four reasons The first
is by cause that he which often thinks on hit absteyneth him of doing evil /
The second is by cause that men ben the more humble of heart / The third is to
the end that we think for to do well / The fourth is that thou desyrest the
life mortal / for to have the life spyritual which is without end / An holy
man required and prayed sometime to our lord that he would show to him what
thing the death was / the which herd a voys within a wood that was nigh to
his hermytage / which voys called him / whereof he was much abashed / Then
he yede out of his hermytage and saw a wonder meruayllous be / which had
the body of an ass legs and thyes of an heart / feet of an horse / and face
of a lion / and had diverse horns / and teeth of diverse manners / but always it
had a voys humayn / to speak morally / The condycyons beforesayd / are the
effects and condycyons of the death / by the body of the ass is vnderstonden
that the death bears al things as the ass does / For she bears the soul
to god if she has done well / and if she has done evil she bears her to the
devil / Item she bears the body for to be eten of worms / and the rychesses
unto the parents and friends by the legs and thyes of ye heart thou ought
to understand the lyg^^hnesse of the death / for she lepeth oueralle swyftelye
and lyghtlye / for now she sleeth a man in bombardye / And sone she sleeth
another in france / for she lepeth and gooth lyghtelye thorugh all lands and
contrees of the world / By the horse feet ought thou to understand the remorse
of conscience / For as the horse is a be fyghtyng and batayllous thus the
death makes the soul to fight ageynste god by the remorse of conscience /
yeldyng to god reason of all that she did when she was in her body / by that
she has an heed of a lion is to be vnderstonden that she doubts none / for
like as the lion doubts neither young nor old / ne sage / noble / nor rich
/ ne strong / nor prelate ne lay man / Thus the death ne doubts no
creature living / by the diverse manners of teeth that she has / thou ought
to understand the dyuersyte of deyeng / For the death sleeth by diverse manners
/ By the diverse horns thou ought to understand that ^^she hurts and
smyteth all / without sparyng of none / as popes cardynalles / emperors /
kings / dukes / princes / and earls / and generally all them that been borne
of mother / by that / that she has voice of man / thou ought to understand
the decepcyon and falshede of the death / For sometime she makes sum to deye
in deed and sometime she fayneth her self to come / and comes not / but sone
after she comes sodaynlye smytyng / wherefore eueryone ought alweyes to live
well / to the end that he may deye well and without doubt and spyrytuelly /
for men ought to doubt the life spyrytuelle / and not the life temporelle /

Iratus de le incetar contendere noli Impedit ira animum ne possis cernere verum
THou ought not to take debate nor stryffe ageynste any person living of a
thing uncertain / specially when thou art wroth / for ire empessheth the
wit and courage of the man / in such manner that he may ne can not Judge nor
see if the thing be true or not / Therefore men ought to enfourme first him
self by good and ripe delyberacyon or he moeuyth noise or stryffe / for ire is
none other thing but a tempestous wind which troubles and destroys often
the life of man / in moeuyng wars and descencions and debates wythouten end /
by deed and by word / the which is cause to waste and destroy towns cytees
and castellys /

Ageynste them that are wroth and angry there been two pryncipal remedies /
that is to wete / sweet words / and sweet answer / and without answer of no
thing to the contrary For like as thou see by experyence that the wood
multeplyeth the fire / like wise / contrary answers multeplyen and chauffen
the man which is wroth and troubled /

Fac sumptum propere cum res desiderat ipsa Da^du^ etenim est aliquid cu^
te^pus postulat aut res
THou ought to do with good heart and hastyly thyn expenses / that is to
wete thy present or yefte when the thing requires it / consyderyng when thou
ought to give / and to whom thou ought to give / For thou ought to
give in time and place as the thing requires For there is time for to sow /
and time for to repe / time for to lose / and time for to win / al things
have their time / The wise man says / dyspende largely in time and place
without making of any noise or stryffe / For men say comynlye that the
nygarde expendeth more than the lyberalle Therefore it is necessary to dyspende
often and to give of his goods ioyousl^y /

Quod nimium est fugito puo gaudere memento Tuta magis puppis est que modico
flumine fertar
TTHou ought to be content of little thing well gotten / and to flee al
superfluyte / For the ship saylleth more surely in a little ryuere / than in
a great flode as in the sea / Therefore says the wise man / that better is to
have few and little things and goods well gotten by Justice and by mesure /
then to have many goods evil gotten by Inyquyte without Justice and mesure
/ The prophet says that by as much as the man is more rich and set in
great dygnyte in to this world / the more pour he is toward the syghte of god
/ The proverb says that he which has little / or as naught / is rich / And
he which is full and has plente of richesse is pour /

Quod pudeat socios prudens celare memento Ne plures culpent id quod tibi
displicet vni
THe man that is wise and sage ought to hyde (...) blame and shame of his
felawes / to the end that m^^ny know not that / thy self allone know / For
they should be of many more blamed and shamed than of the allone / but thou
ought to chastyse them secretelye / and not openly / The proverb says /
that he is false which reherceth and tells the secret of his friend / Item
all that thyn eyes seen / thou ought not to recyte ne tell / but thou
ought to keep hit secret

Nolo putes prauos homines peccata lucrari Temporibus peccata latent et tempore
patent
I Will not that thou wene ne suppose that the evil and wicked men synnars
faynen their sins without to have and receive punycyon and coreccion in this
world or in the other / for the sins ben often hid for a time / but
afterward in certain time they are known and manyfestyd and also punysshed /
If god punysshed not the synnars hit should seem that they should win and that
they should goo quyte of their sins / and that their fayte should be the better
therefore / or else that they should / have sum prouffyte / which thing were
ageynste right and reason / For none evil shall abide wythouten punycyon / ne no
good deeds without remuneracyon / there is none so secret a sin but that at
the last hit shall be manyfestyd and known / Therefore been often dysceyued they
that wene to hyde their sins / as dauyd did of the sin that he had / done
and commysed with barsabee / the which sin before all the people of Israhel
was reuelyd and known / as it is wryton in the second book of kings /

Corporis exigui vires contempnere noli Confilio pollet cui vim natura negauit
THou ought not to dyspreyse the forces and (...) of them which are little
and feeble of body / ne of them which be pour of worldly goods / for how be
hit that there be many which are little and feeble of body by apparaunce or
syghte / Nevertheless it happeth oftymes that they to whom nature has denied
and forsaken her forces or strengthes / ben better and more virtuous to give a
good cou^ceyl / than the other which are strong and myghtyer of body / The
grain of mostarde / how be it that it is little and lothely / nevertheless he
has much of forces and of virtues First be modereth the great humors which
are within the body / Item hit helyth the bytte of a serpente / Of cold venym
and of the tooth ache / Item hit purges or makes clean the brain / and
helyth and breketh the stone / and causes good appetyte / and also comfort
the stomach / and hel^^th dropsye / who should wene that so little and so foul a
grain had so great virtues / Item there is found a precious stone named
agathe which is black of color / This stone is of many and wonder
meruayllous virtues and propyrtees / For when hit is kyndled hit makes the
serpents to flee / and helyth the demonyackes or mad folk / For hit is
contrary to the deuylles / Item if a daughter drink of the water wherein the
said stone shall have be weted / if she be a maid she shall cry whether she will
or not / Item hit makes the ladies flowers to come / and peaseth the dolor of
the belly / and also hit helps the wymmen to be delyuerd of their birth /
Item saint ysydore says / that the said stone kynled and set on fire
brennyth within the water / and who put hit in oil hit quenches / which
thing seems to be ageynste nature /

Quem scieris non esse parem tibi tempore cede Victorem a victo superari sepe
videmur
THou ought to forbere and to favor in time and place / him which thou
know not match ne like to the of time nor of age / ne that has not so
gre^^ experyence as thou haste / for he which has oftymes vaynquysshed and
done many a fair fayte or deed / is sometime veynquysshed of him that before
was vaynquysshed /

The cockadrylle is so strong and so great a serpente / that there is not so
great a be ne so strong that may do him evil / but there is a little be
named mycor which put her self in to the fylthe / and then the cockadrylle
fyndeth hit / and deuoureth hit / the which as soon as she is within the belly
of the said serpente hit perceth or breketh the belly / wherefore the cockadrylle
deyeth sodaynlye /

Aduersus notum noli contendere verbis Lis minimis verbis interdum maxima
crescit
tHou ought not to take debate ne stryffe ageynste thy friends ne to them
which thou know / for often by little words comen and grown great
dyscencions and debates or great words / by which thou myghtest lose thy
friend in a little space of time / the which thou haste acquyred and gotten by
long process of time with great pain / For a little sparcle of fire kyndleth
often a great fire / Also by a little word evil vtteryd and said may be lost a
great and good friend /

Quod deus intendat noli perquirere sort Quod statuit de te sine te deliberat
ipse
tHou outest not to inquire by sort or wytche craft of that / that god will
do or has ordained for to do of the or of sum other creature / for god has
delyberyd and ordained without the that / that he will do of the / Seneques
says that men ought not to inquire but all only of the things which men
may understand and comprehend / and that is licyte and good for to wete and
know / It is read of a clerk which folisshely sustained and said that if he
was predestyned to be saved he might not be dampened / and by the contrary if
he was predestyned for to be dampened / he might not be saved / and that of need
he must be dampened / and therefore he did al his desires and plesures / and
retched not whether he did well or evil / but hit happed that he was right
grievously seek / Then he sent for a much wise and sage phycycyen and prayed
him that he would restore to him his health / The physycyen was right
suffysaunte in medecyne and right good theologyen / or knowing the deuyne
scripture / and he knew well the will and thought of the clerk and said to
him if thou ought to deye of this sickness I should not mow help the / and
to the contrary / If thou ought to be helyd of hit / thou shalt hele well /
Ha sir said the clerk / I know certeynlye that if a remedy be not hastily
put thereto I shall deye / Then said to him the physycyen if thou byleuyst that
thy life may be lengthed by the virtue of medecyne and by me / why byleuest thou
not that penance may lengthen the life of thy soul / The clerk then by the
virtue of the words which the physycyen had said to him began to say / Ha
sir I require you that from hens forth on ye will be physycyen of my soul / For
by your medecyne and words I am delyuerd out of great error and of folysshe
believe / and verayly I believe that mine opinion was false and evil / To the end
that none set feythe to sortyleges ne to deuyners / eurry man ought to
believe stedfastlye without doubt that god may do all / and without him none
may naught do / al be he never so good a man / How then byleuest thou the
sortyl^eges and deuynours / For of that which they do and sayen / they wot
not what they do and they vsen but of evil art by the reuelacyon of the
devil And that more is they should not mow do no thing against the will of
god /

Thou ought to know of truth that often god permytteth and suffers that
/ that the sortylegers and deuynours maken to come / But as says Saint Austyn
/ god suffers hit for to preue the / and to know if thou art steadfast in
the feythe or not / and the devil of hell does hit for to have and dampne the
/ Therefore sayen the doctors of holy church that all tho that byleuen the
sortyleges and deuynours been excommunyed and cursyd of god and of holy church
/ For they been reputed and holden as ydollatres and wicked christian / by cause
that they attrybuen and given unto the devil and to nature humayn the honor
/ reverence and feythe / which they should attrybue unto god only /

Item men find sum sortyleges that maken their sort by herbys / by words
and by many other things for to hele sekenessys of folk / of horses / and of
many other beestys Item there been sum that maken letters or scrowys wherein
they paynte many crosses and many words / and sayen that these words are the
high names of our lord / and that tho that bear hit on them may not perysshe
in fire / in water ne in none other parayllous place /

Item they maken other scrowes for to be bounden upon the persons for to hele
of sum sekenesses / The which sortyleges and wicked folk for none
excomunyng ne cursyng will not absteyne them from their evil and dampnable
deelyng / and know you for certain that all tho that done or maken to be done
such sortyleges and wytchecrafte beforesaid also they that beren hit and that
have trust in them / and al^ tho that sellen or byen them / given or yelden /
synnen right grievously / I say not if one gadre herbs for to do sum medecyne
/ saying upon hit the pater noster / or the credo / that hit be dedely sin
without any other sortylege / and know thou that this cursyd sin of
sortylege haboundeth more in wymmen than in men / by cause that they have less
of dyscrescion / and that they believe more lyghtelye than the men /

Inuidiam nimio cultu vitare memento Que si non ledit tamen hanc sufferre
molestum
^^Hou ought not to have envy on thy brother christian Ne to have over
precious Iewellys ne raymentes / For how be it that hit lets ne dommageth
not them on whom thou have envy / Nevertheless it is to them greef and
moleste for to suffer and forbere hit / for envy proprely is to have joy of
the evil and dommage of other / and to have woo and doloure of his well / Saint
Austyn says / that he which has envy of other men's goods / is like him
which is blind of the rays of the son / Seneques says that there ben as
many of tourmentes and cursings ready made for the enuyous / as there are
goods and blessings for the beneurous or happy /

Esto forti animo cum sis dampnatus inique Nemo diu gaudet qui iudice vincit
iniquo
tHou ought to be pacyente and strong of courage when thou art condemned
falsely and wrongfully for at the end thou shalt be thereof avenged / for the
Judge that Iugeth unjustly shall not enjoy long his office / but of his
vniustyce and Inyquyte he shall be punysshed / Salamon says that the Just
cause and the good right that the simple person has of him self shall dress
his way / and the wicked and unjust or untrue shall be punysshed of his
Inyquyte and evil / He that is constaunte and steadfast in all his aduersytees
acquyreth four goods / The first is when he is constaunte or steadfast / he
may not be surmounted ne suppedyted or ouercomen of all the world And by cause
that all the world should not mow vaynquysshe him that is steadfast and
constaunte / be thou therefore constaunte and Insuperable / The second is by
cause that he has ever vyctorye on his enemies / The iij is by cause that he
becomes rich thereof The fourth is by cause that at the end he acquyreth
therefore the glory of paradyse / which is ever apparaylled and ready for to
receive them that been strong and virtuous in this world in resystyng to the
sins and vices of this world /

Nec te collaudes, nec te culpaueris ipse Hoc faciunt stulti quos gloria vexat
inanis
tHou ought not to preyse ne to blame thy self in no manner / For thou
ought to leave to other to preyse or blame the / and not thy self / For the
foles ouerwenen and full of vaynglorye preysen and glorefyen them self of their
own faytes or deeds / for three reasons euydente / none ought not to preyse
him self ne wyllyng to be preysed of other / The first is let him consydere
the time passed and he shall find that he has done many things / of the
which he ought to be wooful and desplaysaunte / The second is that if he
consydereth and ouerseeth the time which is to come / he shall see many things
of which he ought to be doubtous / The third is if he consydere the time
present / he shall find within him many vices and sins / and therefore none
ought not to desire to have preysyng ne to preyse him self in this world /

Litis preteriti noli maledicta refer Post inimicicias iram meminisse malorum
est
tHou ought to keep thy pees of thy maledyccions or cursings and stryues
passed and gone / and not to reherce ne tell them / For thou ought to put
them out of thy mind / specially when thou have made pees with him to whom
thou had debate and noise / For it is the deed of wicked and evil folk for
to remember and to wythholde in his heart the hate and rancour of time passed /
Tullyus says that there nys no thing so foul ne so dyshoneste / as for to
make werre ageynste him with whom men have l^yued long with frendshyp in good
pees and concord Item in time passed when Rome was paynym / was a temple
within Rome which was founded in the worship of the god of pees and of
concord / within the which temple / the god of concord was set in such
manner that all the other ydolles and statues or images which were there had
the face turned toward the yate of the said temple /

And the god of concord had the face turned toward the wall / And was
wryton before him this same word / Benefyce / And behind him was wrypen / ire
/ in betokenynge that all men that will make and have pees and concord
ought to put abacke ire and all the Iniuryes / wyich have been done to him /
for otherwise should be taken from him such goods that he should have acquyred
and gotten before /

Vtere quesitis modico cum sumptus habundat Labitur exiguo quod partum est
temport longuo
tHou ought to dyspende and to use of thyn acquyred and gotten things by
mesure and attemperatly though thou have of them great habundaunce / For men
has dyspended and consumed in little time that which men has acquyred and
spared with great labor and pain in a long space of time / Therefore says
the decretalle / that the living gotten and acquyred by long time / is
despended in a little space of time / And therefore men ought not to be
ouermoche a nygarde / ne ouermoche large in gyuyng there as no need is for to
give / by cause that al things have their time / For there is time for to give
/ and time for to with hold and to keep his goods /

Incipiens esto dum tempus postulat aut res Stulticiam similare loco prudencia
su^ma est
tHou ought to be sage and wise / and to make the a fool or to dyssymylle
folly in time and in place when the thing requires it / For it is souerayn
prudence for to can dyssymule folly / that is to wete for to feyne to be a fool
in time and place couenable / for many one have made and feyned to be a fool
for many causes / first for teschewe offense humayn / secondly for vaynglorye /
thyrdly for teschewe their person of sum Inconuenyentes / and the fourth
cause for to eschew the deuyne offense of god /

Luxuriam fugito simul et vitare memento Crimen auaricie nam sunt contraria fame
Hou ought to eschew and to flee lecherye and auaryce by cause that thy
vices and sins are contrary to good renommee / for by lecherye men lesen
their silver and their substance / men anger god / and lesen their bodies
thereof / Therefore says galyen that man febleth and debylyteth more his body by
losyng of a little of his semence or nature than to lose forty times more of
his blood / For they that vsen much wymmen lesen their color and becomen sone
old and feeble of body / It is read in the life of faders / of an holy fader
which had nourysshed a young child within his hermytage that was within a
wode / but when this child was come to age / he was often tempted of the sin
of lecherye / and of fayte or in deed he would return in to the world for to
have married him / whereof the holy fader was gretelye wroth / In so much that
by the space of two year / the said holy fader by good exhortacion kept the
said child fro the world / but at the end he said to the holy fader that he
might no more endure / and that it was force that he should return in to the
world / To whom said the holy fader / Sithe thou must return in to hit /
thou shalt goo and shalt take a wife / For by marriage thou may do thy
sauemente / but or thou go hens / I demau^nde of the a yefte / that is to
wete that thou goo first to the fontaygne which thou know that is within
the foreste / and there thou shalt fast forty days / prayeng our lord that
he vouchesaufe to give to the a good wife / and of this was the young man well
content /

Then he took of breed as much as mysteryd unto him / and after went to the
fontaygne / and when he had fasted there by the space of twenty days / as he
was in oryson he began to f^^le and smelle such a wonder stenche so great
and so horrible / that he might not endure ne suffer hit / and then apperyd
before him a wonderful and foul woman right old that was scabbed and her
nose droppyng / from which came all the said stynche / she salewyd him saying
/ Allas where art thou my dear friend / I have sought the long / and never I
could find the till now / alas said she I have loved and desired the more than
all the men of the world And then the young man answered unto her / O right
foul and stynkyng old fylthe what demaundest thou / I pray the derely that
thou will lie with me / To that word said the young man / fie fie / and
spytte in her face / and said god forbede that I have such a love or paramour
so full of ordure or fylthe / so stynkyng and so foul as thou art / and then
he demanded of her what she was and what was her name / I am said she lecherye
/ It is now two year passed that I began for to seche the / that is to wete
when thou were first tempted of lecherye / Certeynlye said the young man if I
had known that the sin of lecherye had been so foul and so stynkyng / I
never should have had will for to return in to the world / And therefore I
promytte and make o vow to god that from hens forth I shall keep vyrgynyte /
Then he returned to the foresaid holy fader / and recounted unto him all that
he had seen and herd / Then was the holy hermyte much glad and joyous and
said to the young man / if thou had fasted and accomplysshed the forty
days / thou sholdest have well seen and herd other reuelacyons / and after
that the said young man dwelled stylle in the said hermytage in his vyrgynyte

Noli tu quedam refferenti credere semper Exigua est tribuenda fides quia multi
multa loqu^tur
^Hou ought not ever to believe that / that men sayen and reporten to the ne
to add feythe to hit / as done many iouglers which tellen tidings by sweet
words for to deceive the / for many sayen and tellen many things which are
not true / for hit may not be / but that in over many words ne been sum
lesynges / Therefore says Esope that men ought not to believe alweye all the
words that men heren say / For he is for a fool reputed and holden that
byleueth the words of a mycheaunte liar / The encheson and cause that moeuen
the Infydeles and paynyms for to say such words / is by cause that there ben
few of crystens / and yet that more is / of tho that been crystene few shall be
sauyd / For they only that keep the commandments of god shall be sauyd /
and that byleuen that holy church byleueth / the which arguen thus and sayen
wherefore should god have created so great a nombre of folk when he knows and
knew well that they should be dampened / For there ben twyes as much more of
Infydeles or paynyms than there be of christian / and of the christian allonely the
good shall be saved and sayen that if so were that they should be dampened with
the evil christian / for one saved there should be a thousand dampened and moo /
Item they say that it is meruaylle / how god gives and has given so much
goods and rychesses to so great a multitude of people / when he knows and
knew well that they ben and shall be dampened / To this error men may answer and
say / that it is no meruaylle if many been dampened / to the comparyson and
regard of them that are saved / for it is no meruaylle if Justice renders and
gives to the synnners that / that they have deserved / and of this none ought
to be meruaylled / for thou see well that the son renders and gives his
light to all the world / as well to the evil as to the good / Wherefore none
ought to meruayll him / if the mysericorde of god gives much of goods to
the good / ne if the Justice of god punyssheth tho that are rebelle and evil
ageynste god / and for the Informacyon of this / saint austyn says / that if
god would all the evil people should be good / but he loves better that they be
that / that they will be / for if they be good / this shall not be without merit
ne gwerdon / like wise if they be evil and wicked / it shall not be without
punycion / for none may not excuse him self but that he shall do well if he will
/ by cause that eueryone has his free arbytre and lyberalle will for to do
well or evil / The holy scripture says that god puts before the man two
glases / that is to wete life and death / and which of them that he will have he
shall have / for if he do well he shall have life pardurable or without end /
and if he do evil he shall have eternal death / wherefore it apperyth clearly
that we ought not to believe the arguments of thynfydeles / for they sayen and
maken many arguments / and they wot not how /

Quod potu peccas ignoscere tu tibi noli Nam nullum crimen vini est sed culpa
bibentis
tHou ought not to blame none if thou synnest by over much drynkyng of wine
/ so that thou becomest thereof drunk / for it is not the fawte of the wine /
but of him that ouermoche drynketh of hit / For the wine in as much as it is
created of god / hit is good by cause that hit does much good / who takes it
temperatelye and by mesure / Arystotle says in his book of secrets / that the
wine taken temperatelye renders the man joyous / and able in all things that
he has to do /

Consilium archanum tacito commit sodali Corporis auxilium medico commit

tHou ought to counceyl thy self secretelye unto thy lawful friend and
felawe of thyn affairs or deeds and werkys / when thou know that he is
lawful and secret and when thou have well approuyd him / Like wise thou
ought not to do medecyne thy body / but of him which is lawful / trusty and
expert in the art of medecyne for to medecyne thy body / The prophet says
that men ought to believe his ancient friend and his secret counceylle / and
not the new the which men have not yet approved / A prophet was ones
demanded what thing he should / do the next morrow / which answered / if I
should tell hit to the how sholdest thou keep hit secret and not tell hit /
when I may not keep it secret but that I must tell hit to the /

Successus dignos noli tu far moleste Indulget fortuna malis vt ledere possit
tHou ought to bear pacyently the fortunes unworthy and contrary to the
which comen not on the by thy sins and deserts / For by as much as thou
see that sum ben better fortuned than thy self art of so much more makes
them fortune to descend and fall a low shamefully / For fortune nys none
other thing / but nature without reason / For she spares sometime the evil /
to the end that she may hurt and deceive them / Therefore the evil and wicked
folk ben often more fortuned of worldly goods than the good folk / The wise
beda says / that the good ought not to meruaylle them self / for as much
that the evil been well fortuned in this world / For it apperteyneth not to the
good after the relygyon christian to be enhaunced in temporal goods / For hit
behooves to them to be pour and holden for foul in this world / For the evil
has no thing in heaven ne the good on the earth /

Prospice qui veniunt hos casus esse ferendos Nam leuius ledit quidquid
preuidimus ante
tHou ought often think to the fortunes and caas that may fallen to the fro
day to day / to the end that thou be not overtaken by vnaduertaunce or
vnwyttyngly / for all fortunes and aduersytees of which thou have be aduysed /
hurten ne greuen the not so much / as they which comen sodaynlye / Seneque
says that the wise man ought to think ever in his courage on the fortunes
and adventures which may come upon him / For the wise man says never I
supposed that any such fortune should have comen on me /

Rebus in aduersis animum submittere noli Spem retinere spes animum non morte
relinquet
tHou ought not to dyspeyre the for the things contrary and adverse that
comen and may come to the / for thou ought for to have and to reteyne in thy
self good and steadfast hope unto the time of thy death / For every man ought to
have good hope when he is in the article of death / for to live eternally in the
glory of paradyse / dyspeyre or wanhope is propyce / and good to the enemy of
hell and contrary to al reason / for the man that deyeth in dyspeyre shall
never have pardon nor remyssyon of his sins / And thus though that thy werkys
or deeds goo not after thy will / and that fortune be contrary to the / thou
ought not therefore to dyspeyre the / but to have good hope that god shall
give to the enough of goods in time to come / for tho that have no fortune nor
none aduersytees in this world ben not beloved of god / Saint ambrose on a
time as he went toward Rome he lodged him with an host / which was much
rich to whom he demanded of his estate / Which answered that he was much
rich and well fortuned / and that never he had had nonevnfortune nor dysplesure
/ in this world / but ever had be in good prosperyte of body and of goods /
and that he had lived Worshypfully / and that his goods did encrece and
multeplye daily / and things come to him at his pleasure / and then when
saint ambrose understood this / he was much abashed and in great doubt
wherefore he anon said to his servants / let us lyghtelye depart fro hens /
for god is not here / and by adventure ye might be taken with him in his
rychessys and sins / Then as they went and were not yet far from the
hows of the said man / the earth claue in two and swalowed in the said rich
man / his goods / his wife / and al his meyne / Then saint ambrose turned him
and said / look my brethern how god pardonneth medefully to them to whom he
sends and gives aduersite in this world / and how he punyssheth cruelly them
to whom he gives none aduersyte but al prosperyte / and it is said that there
is as yet in the same place a pytte in mind and remembrance of the said
miracle and ensaumple /

Rem tibi quam noscis aptam dimittere noli Front capillata post hec occasio
calua est
tHou ought not to leave the thing which thou know of present and for
time to come prouffytable and necessary / specially when fortune is unto the
favorable and good / and when thou art in good prosperyte / for after this
good fortune which thou sholdest leave and forsake / might come unto the
another evil fortune adverse and contrary to the / by thencheson of which
thou might be despoyled of al thy goods / wherefore thou sholdest never recover
that / that thou leftest and forsook / For the common proverb says / that men
ought never to put at their feet / that which they hold with their hands /
Lucan / says that all delayeng and neclygence ought to be set a part /
For negligence lets ever al things which one may have forthwyth if he leave
hem not by negligence / and says yet / that all that thou may do this day /
thou ought not to abide unto the next morn for to do hit / for when the
man is in his good fortune and prosperyte / he acquyreth many friends /
Therefore says the wise man / when thou shalt be rich and well fortuned thou
shalt have many friends / but when fortune shall be contrary to the thou shall
be left allone /

Quod sequitur specta quod que innuet ante videto Illum imitare deum qui pertem
spectat vtramque
tHou ought to think and to take heed to the things present / passed and
to come / for thou ought for to follow him / that beholds both one and
other party / that is to wete the things present / passed / and yet to come
/ Saint austyn says as in the person of god / o thou man / if thou dysplesest
and know thy self thou sholdest plese me / but by cause that now / thou
will not look ne know thy self thou please the and dyspleasest me / for the
time shall come in which thou shalt dysplease thy self / and me also / that
is to wete / when thou shalt be Iuged of me and of thy self also for thy
sins when thou shalt brenne in the fire of hell / Seneques says that the
wise man and prudente ought to dyspose and to ordeyne of three times / for he
ought to ordeyne of the time present / and to take heed on the time which is
to come / and to have in his mind the time passed for else he should not goo
well /

Forcius vt valeas interdum parcior esto Pauca voluptati debentur plura saluti
tHou ought to be temperate and mesured in all things / to the end that
thou be more strong both of body and of soul for to resist the vices and
sins / for a little thing thou ought to do for thy delight and pleasure /
that is to wete little drink and little mete / and to be selde lecherous and
auaricious / by cause that all excess ben contrary to the salvation of thy
soul / but thou ought to do many things / for thou ought to be ware and
to tempere thy self of ouermoche mete and drink and to flee al worldly desires
and to do al things agreeable and plesaunte to god / Seneque says that by
voluptees and excess common four euylles / First by cause that excessys ben
cause of many sekenessys both of body and of soul / and at the end follows
death / The second is by cause that they let and empesshen the man for to do
his salvation / The third is by cause that by excess men forgeten all
benefaytes or good deeds / The iiij is for they leden the man in to the pytte
of hell and to pain eternal or without end /

Iudicium populi nu^qua^ contempseris vnus Nam nulli placeas du^ vis
contempnere multos
tHou ought not to dyspreyse the Judgment and sentence of many other when
they ben wise and prudente / for thou may not ne ought not to plese to
sum if thou will dyspreyse gaynsaye and dysplease many other for if thou
gaynsayest and dispreysest every body thou sholdest be holden for a fool / for
he is well presumtuous and cursyd of all the world and reputed the most fool
of all fools / that dyspreyseth all men and that will not have frendeshyp nor
please no body / but he him self allone will by his ouerwenyng return and
dyspreyse the sentence of many wise and prudente men /

Sic tibi precipue quoth primum est cura salutis Tempora ne culpes cum sint tibi
causa dolor
tHou ought first and pryncypally to think upon the cure of the salvation
of both thy soul and body for thou art cause of thy sickness and not the
time Therefore tho ben fools that blamen and reprouen the time / saying that
the time is cause of their sickness / of their fortune / and of their sin /
Item sum sayen the time is now evil and peryllous / certeynly they wot not
what they sayen for no time is evil of him self / Theuangelyst says seek first
the royame of god and ye shall have al things that are necessary to you and
prouffytable to the salvation of your sowles / Secondly thou ought to seek
the saueme^te of thy body / that is that thou be of good rewle and temperate in all things Seneque says that by ouermoche mete and ouermoche drink comen many
sekenesses / Item the leches sayen that ye mowth that is to say ouermoche
drink and ouermoche mete and making of excess / sleeth more folk than the
sword in bataylles /

Sompnia ne cures na^ men's humana quoth optat Dum vigilat sperat per sompnu^
cernit idipsum
tHOu ought not to retche ne to think on such dremes that thou dremest ne
to add feythe nor believe to them / For thou dremest often and so is thumayn
thought enclyned to dreme slepyng that / that she shall have desired and
coueyted wakyng / for hit seems often / that one sees in his sleep that / that
he did see when he waked / Saint gregory says that there been four manners of
dremys The first comes by ouermoche affeccion that one has to the thing that
he dremeth of / and to such dremes none ought to believe ne add feythe to
them by no manner / The second is which comes by cogytacyon or thynkyng
fantastyke and by Illusyon of the devil / and such dremys none may not be
eschewed / The third comes by reuelacyon deuyne / and to this dreme men
oughten to add feythe and to believe hit / The fourth comes by the desire of
the thing that men have seen wakyng / and of this dreme by this present
commandment is said that men oughten not to retche of hit / ne to add to
hit ^^eythe in no manner of wise /

Incipit liber tercius
Hoc quicunque velis carmen cognoscere lector Haec praecepta feres quae su^t
gratissima vite
If thou will flee vices and sins / thou ought for to keep these
commandments / which are of right canon approuyd and of the holy scripture
/ Therefore every person that will have parfyte knowledge of the commandments
of this book ought to keep and wythholde the commandments which he cafter
folowen / for they been right agreeable and prouffytable to al them that will
led good life and flee vices and sins / wrerfore every man ought to note and
reteyne them in their mind and wit /

Instrue praeceptis animum ne discere cesses Nam sine doctrina vita est quasi
mortis ymago
THou ought not cesse to learn and to teache these commandments / For the
man which is without doctrine is like thymage of death / and therefore if thou
keep not the commandments of this book hit shall be thy dommage / and not the
dommage of him that made and composed them and know thou therefore that thou
ought not to cesse of lernyng unto time thou be parfyte in them / Seneque
says that it is better that the old man learn in his old age / than to be
ygnoraunce of that / that he owes to know / and says that the man without
doctrine resembles and is lykenyd to an image of death / for right so as hit is
pryued fro life naturalle / semblably the man without doctrine is pryued fro al
virtues / and filled of al vices and sins / therefore none ought not to escuse
him to learn that which is necessary for his salvation / be he old or young
or of what someuer age he be / for it is better late than never /

Comoda multa feres sinautem spreueris illud Non me scriptorem sed to
neglexeris ipse
THou shalt acquyre much of proffytes if thou keep well and reteyne these
commandments / but if thou dyspreysest them / there shall thereof come to the
man euylles / for if thou keep hem not well / that shall not be to me no dommage
/ that am but writer of them / but hit shall be thyn own dommage and none other
/ Many euylles and Inconuenyentes shall fall on the if thou kept not well these
commandments / For first al cursings shall come to the by cause that thou
shalt be cursyd in feldes and possessyon^^ and in all goods temporalle and
spyrytual / Item fruit begoten of the shall be cursyd and of al thy land / and
al thy goods also / but to the contrary if thou kepest them well al blessings
and goods shall come to the / and shall be benewred and preysed in the cite and
in all goods both spyritual and temporelle / and the fruit that shall issue of
the shall be blessed / and also the fruit of thy land and of all thy goods /
Item god shall send to the his tresoure of paradyse / that is to wete of heaven
/ from which shall descend rain for to bedewe the earth /

Cum recte viuas ne cures verba malorum Arbitrij nostri non est quoth quisque
loquatur
THou ought not to retche ne to take heed of the words that the evil folk
sayen of the / specially when thou lyuest Iustlye and holyly / For it is not in
our lyberal arbitre for to pease or to make to be stylle and to be in pees the
evil tongues / and therefore thou ought not to have charge nor to retche of
what ever they sayen of the / For they sayen sooner evil than good / and sooner
they do their do^mage than thyn / After right canon says that the evil folk
sleeth the good in fourtene manners / The first is in taking the goods fro the
church / The second in making dyffyculte to give the benefyces and the things
ecclesyastyke / The third is when they take the goods fro their parents /
that is to wete of their fader and mother / The fourth is when they done sum
wylful thing whereof comes harm and evil / The fyfthe is when they give
naught to the^^ that have need / The vj is when they denyen or forsaken the
tithes which they owen to god and to holy church / The seventh is when they
letten and vexen their christian brother of will and of deed / The viij is when
they encorage sum person to do evil / The ix is when they seken and
purchasen the loss and the death of young children / The tenthe is when they
cut sum membre / that is to say when they hurten sum of their parents /
The enleuenth is when they take the benefaytes fro other / The xij is / when
they do sum thing whereof sum other may be brought to death / The xiij is
when they haten their christian brother / The fourtene is when they give counceyl
of death /

Productus testis saluo tamen ante pudore Quantu^cu^que potes celato crimen
amici
THou ought to keep secret the blame and mysde^^ of thy friend as much as
thou may / that is to wete when he is accused of sum caas and that thou be
called in witness against him / for to say truth / but when thou art
constreyned for to swear / thou ought not to fore swear thy self for his
sake / ne to dyshonoure and blame thy self / The wise man says in this manner
/ how be it that Socrates and Platon ben my friends / Nevertheless I love
better truth / than Socrates or Platon / For over al things thou ought to
love truth /

Sermones blandos blesosque cauere memento Simplicitas very fama est fraus
ficta loquendi
THou ought to eschew sweet and frendelye (...) when they ben feyned and
deceyuable / As they that speken swetelye sorowyng and syghyng / but if they be
virtuous / thou ought to hold and approve them / For symplenesse having
fame or renommee to say ever truth / is evil / therefore men oughten to
eschew them /

Signiciem fugito quia vitae ignauia fertur Nam cu^ animus languet consumit
inercia corpus
THou ought to flee and eschew idleness and slothfulness mother of al
sins / empty of all goods and filled of all evil / For when the courage
languyssheth and that hit is abandonned to slothfulness hit consumes and
destroys the body of the person / Item he that is slothful to do
spyrytual goods is werste of all /

It is read of a slouthful man which reproved an abbot by cause that he set
and made his relygyous or monks for to work / and said why make ye the goods
to be labored which comen wythouten labor by them that seruen and love god
/ Therefore said our lord to marye magdalene that she had chosen the best
party when her suster martha repreuyd her / by cause that she helpyd her not
for to do her business and work / For she did none other thing / but pray
and here god and to be in contemplacyon / Then the abbotte did do take the
said man / which held him self so devout / and maad him to be shette
within a fair oratorye and devout / and said to him sithe thou art so
spyrytual / that thou may live without werkyng / hold (...) is a much
fair book and devout / in the which thou shalt have contemplacyon in god
here within this oratorye / And then when the hour of none was passed / he
began to be an hongred and herkenyd and looked over if thabbotte would call
him to dinner / and when the time for to sowpe was comin he demanded of the
abbotte if the brethern had eten any mete of all that day / and said that he was
sore an hongred Ha ha said the abbotte thou say that thou art spyrytuell
they that lyuen spyrytuelly have no cure ne need of our metes / For we
labouren for to have our living and food / Then he began for to cry mercy
to the abbotte of ^^hat he had said / and began for to repent him of hit /
Ha said the abbotte I see well what thou nedest to have / Certeynlye thou have
myster of marye magdeleyne and of marye marthe that is to say / that thou must
work and do sum labor for to get thy living with / and thou must also
have contemplacyon and pray god for to have the life eternal /

Interpone tuis interdum gaudia curis Vt possis animo qua^uis sub far laborem
THou ought sometime to take rest / solas and joy in thy werkys /
operacions or besynesses or to study or in sum other labor / for if thou
be temperate in all thyn operacyons or works thou shall bear more patiently and
more lightly within thy courage and understanding the faytes and the pain of
thy labor / for all things have both their time and place who that can take
hit / and thou see by experyence of the bow / when it is ever bendyd it is
marryd and spylte / also like wise the man may not ever be in trauaylle and
pain / Therefore says arystotle that the men have sometime and oughten for to
have corporalle or bodily recreacyon / as well as labor spyrytual or
corporalle /

Alterius dictum vel factu^ ne carpseris vnquam Exemplo simili ne te derideat
alter
THou ought not to scorn ne mocque of the faytes or deeds of other / that
is to wete wha^ thou see so^me person evil fortunate or accused or Iuged of
sum vice / For by adventure the time shall come that by such a caas and
exemple they might mocque and scorn the / and men would say / this felawe
mocqued and scorned such one now late of his vnfortune and myserye / and now
he is fall in to gretter vnfortune and myserye than he which he mocked was in
/ for it is said comynly / that he that mocqueth other shall be mocqued / and
thus none may ne ought not to scorn the deeds of other / For he knows not
what thing shall to him befalle / For the sentence is Just and reasonable /
that he that mocqueth and scorneth other / shall be a the end scorned and
mocqued /

Quod tibi sors dederit tabulis suprema notato Augendo serua ne sis quam fama
loquatur
THou ought well to note and to write in to thy books / that is to wete in
thy wit and mind / the first fortunes and good adventures that come to the
and to keep and encrece them in such manner that thou may not have no blame
nor repreef by them / that is to wete that when thou art rich thou ought
to dyspende and give of thy goods by mesure / to the end that thou be not
reputed for auarycyous / ne no nygarde / and also if thou gave of them to
largely thou sholdest mow fall in pouerte / and so every man should mocque
with the / and of the should men sayen as the common proverb says / The same
has done so much by his two hands / that he is come fro the moest unto the least / And therefore thou ought to keep mesure / and thy goods shall ever
encrece and multeplye fro better to better /

Cum tibi diuiciae superant in fine senectae Munificus facito viuas non parcus
amicis
THou ought to be lyberalle and large at the end of thy days unto thy
friend / and no nygarde / that is to wete when thou have whereof and that thy
rychesses are ouermoche and more than to thyn estate needs for to be holden /
For thou ought to give and to depart so^me to thy parents and friends /
and to do therewith almesses to the pour membrys of Ihesu christ / Saint ambrose
says that if thou gyuest not mete and drink to him that deyeth for hungre if
thou have whereof / thou thy self sleest and put him to death and art cause
of his death /

Vtile consilium dominus ne displice serui Nullius sensum si prodest
cotempseris vnquam
THou ought not to dyspreyse the counceyl of thy servants if hit be
prouffytable and vtyle / nor also the wit and counceyl of no person / if
hit prouffyte to the and is vtyle for the and for thy fayte / though that thou
be great and mighty lord / Seneque says that thou must consydere that thy
servants be men as thou a^^e / an^^ that it is necessary and nedeful to the
for to have servants for to serve the / and therefore thou ought not to
dyspreyse their counceyl when it is prouffytable and vtyle / but thou ought
to here and herke them swetely and to use their cou^ceyl when it is
prouffytable and good / for often they that are humble have gretter yefte of
sapyence and ben more sages than they that are proud and enhaunced and set
on the high chayer in audyence /

Rebus et in sensu si non est quod fuit ante Fac viuas contentus eo quoth tempora
prebent
THou ought to be content of that / that the time gives to the / how be it
that thou have not so much of good as thou had before / Therefore thou must
refrain and leave sum of thyn estate / and to make l^^se expenses / for if
thou will hold so great a state as thou was wont for to do / thou myghtest
not furnysshe it without taking and steelyng vniustelye the other mennys good /
and by so thou ought to be content of that / that thou have of present /
and for to hold thyn estate after thy rent and revenue / and to render graces
and thanks to god of all / Notwythstondyng that thou have not so much of
rentes and of pocessyons as thou was wont to have / or of marchaundyses if
thou be a marchaunte / For the goods of this world been varyable / now one is
rich / and now pour / Socrates says / that there was a man that compleyned
unto him by cause that he was pour / which demanded of him coun^^yll what
thing he should do / To whom Socrates answer^^d If the goods that thou have
be not suffysaunte for thyn estate and for thy living / do and govern thy
self by such manner that thou be suffysyng to thy goods / and so shalt thou
be content of thyn estate / Do thou as Job said / god gaf^^ hit to me / and
god has taken hit fro me / god be thanked of al / For thus it has pleased to
him / and thus he has hit done / Therefore every one ought to be content of
that / that god gives to him /

Pxorem fuge ne ducas sub nomine dotis Nec retinere velis si ceperit esse
molesta
THou ought not to take a wife ne to coueyte her for her dowayr / for her
richesse ne for her noblesse / but thou ought to chese and take her for her
virtues and good condycyons / and for cause of her good worshypful and honest
lygnage or kynrede / and specially when she has a good mother / For the
daughters folowen often the condy^^on^^ and manners of the moders / but when thou
art wedded if ^^y adventure she does to the sum moleste or greef / that is
to say if she be an harlotte or an aduoultrere / thou ought to flee fro her
and to put her out fro thy felawshyp / and know thou after right canon and
cyuyl that thou ne ought for to leave and put her fro the but only for
aduoultrye / For know thou that it is the souerayn gift of god for to have a
good and lawful wife /

Multorum disce exemplo quae facta sequaris Quae fugias vita nobis est aliena
magistra
THou ought to learn by ensaumple of many wise men what business thou
ought to do / First thou ought to flee and teschewe that / that they
have eschewed and fled / for the life of the other strangers which have
preceded us must be rewle and maystresse of all our deeds and gouernementes /
that is to say that thou ought to consydere how many are come to great
worship and perfeccion for to have rewled and gouernyd them wisely / and how
many are comen to great myserye by their evil ledyng and governance / and by
cause that the faytes or deeds of this world ben varyable and dyffycyle for to
know thou ought for to think and to think ageyn many times to that / that
thou will do / and how of like caas is betaken to the auncyente wise men and
by so / thou shalt mow know of light that that is prouffytable or
chargeable /

Cum tibi vel socium / vel fidum queris amicum Non tibi fortuna hominis sed
vita petenda est
THou ought not to demand the fortune of man / but his life / that is to
say that when thou will aquyre and have a good friend and a lawful felawe thou
ought not to demand of his fortune / that is to wete if he be rich noble
or puyssaunte / but ought to demand if he be of good living wise and
prudente / for by science and wysedom men may recyste to the falaces and
decepcions of fortune / by cause that / that fortune gives to the of long
time she takes hit ageyn fro the within a short space of time / but science
or connyng lasts and endures unto the time of death / for none may take hit
from the / The phylosophre says that there ben four manners of persons which
keep not true love / the first is the cruel man and evil / For he ne
demands but hate falsehede and stryffe / The second i^^ the auncyente man /
by cause that he doubts lest he should be deceived / the third is the child
/ for for an apple one leseth his love / The fourth is the common woman / for
who that gives to her most shall have her love / but very and true love
endures ever both in aduersite and in prosperyte betwyxte two good and lawful
friends /

Quod potes id tempta operis ne pondere pressu^^ Succu^bat labor et frustra
temptata relinquas
THou ought to preue and assaye if thou art strong enough / and virtuous
for to accomplysshe and to do that / that thou purposest for to do / or that /
that thou have begone for to do / and how thou ought to lead hit to good
end / to the end that thy labor / that is to wete ^^hat / which thou
shalt have begone for to do be not to the over grievous / and that thou bow
not under hit / for thou sholdest leave all that thou had begone / wherefore
every man should mocque the / for it is gretter worship for to keep him self
fro the beginning of the things which may not be performed ne brought to an
end / than for to begin them and after to leave them vnparfyte / Esope says
that he that weneth to mow and know more than his faculte and nature
requires / all his fayte or deed is naught / by cause that all remains
vnparfyte /

Quod nosci factum non recte noli silere Ne videare malos imitare velle tacendo
THou ought not to hold thy pees of that / that thou know Iniustely done
and without reason / for if thou know sum thing ageynste the law / or
against the common well / or ageynste one partyculer men / (...) else against
many / thou ought to recyte and manyfesten hit / / for if thou keep hit
secretelye / men should mow say that thou were partyner and assentyng to the
fayte or deed / and should seem that thou sholdest love more injustice than
Justice in as much that thou sholdest hyde the vices of theuyl folk and should
spare to chastyse them and to recyten their misdeeds and wickednessesses / I
say not but that thou may admoneste them by fair words or thou recyte or
tell their sins and misdeeds / Saint austyn says suppose thou not that hit
be evil done to reherce and to Judge the sins of other / by cause that if thou
sholdest hyde them / thou sholdest do wers by the half / and sholdest be cause
of their dampnacyon and losing both of body and soul /

Iudicis auxilium sub iniqua lege rogato Ipse etenim leges cupiunt vt iure
regantur
THou ought to require help of the Judge when the law is to sharp and over
rygorous / that is to wete that when thou art accused of sum caas partyculer
and that the law is to rygorous against the / or when men will do to the
vniustyce / thou ought to require and beseech humbly the help of the Judge /
ffor the lawys will and requyren that they be governed and Interpretyd ever to
the best party for him that has wrong / Item also the Judge may modere of his
office the laws when they ben over rygorous / for it is better that the Judge
be reproved to be ouermoche myserycordyons or mercyful / than to be over cruel
and rygorous / Nevertheless the laws that are approuyd by right canon ben
good and true / Notwythstondyng that they semen to be untrue to him which is
condemned by them / Item also every good Judge of his office may modere them a
little /

Quod merito pateris pacienter far memento Cumque zeus tibi sis ipsum te
iudice dampna
THou ought to suffer and bear pacyentlye the pain that thou have deseruyd
/ and to the which by good right and Justice thou art condemned / For sithe
that thou know thy self gylty / thou ought to be thyn own Judge and to
condemn thy self / Boece says that the evil and wicked folk ought to goo
and to present them before their Iuges of their own gree and will and to
require humbly punycyon of their vices and sins / For hit is better that the
malefactor Judge him self than that another should Judge him / and this is that
the appostle says / If we be Iuges of our self we shall not be Iuged of Ihesu
christ / as did the sons of Israhel / which said That / that we suffren / we
suffer it Iustlye / For we have sinned ageynste our brother /

Multa legas facito perlectis perlege multa Nam miranda canunt sed non credenda
poetae
THou ought to read and study many things / and wythholde the good and
flee the evil / for it is good and prouffytable to know both good and e^^yl /
but thou ought not to believe all that thou shalt read / by cause that the
poets and many other sayen and rehercen many fables and things meruayllous /
And for this cause none ought for to be curyous of the lore and doctrine of
these poets the which are full of fables and lesynges / Valere says that by
especyal the young children ought to flee the doctrine of the poets / by cause
that they believe of light all that they heren or seen / and therefore thou
ought to study of al scyences and to withholden in thy mind the good and
flee the evil /

Inter conuiuas fac sis sermon modestus Ne dicare loquax du^ vis vrbanus haberi
THou ought to be temperate in words and to keep thy self fro ouermoche
talkyng at the table emonge them that eten and drynken / for thou ought to
be temperate in speech / to the end that they sayen not that thou art a liar
and a tidings maker / specially when thou will be holden and reputed for
humble curtoys and gracious / of this thou have experyence of the laborers
rustycal / when they been at a tauenne they make so great noise that none may
endure by them / for to have sooner done often they speak all together in such
manner that they wot not what they sayen / ne what the other sayen that are
with them / The wise man says that none ought to strive against his friend
when he eteth or drynketh / ne to blame him when he is joyous and merry /
Therefore every man ought to keep him self fro ouermoche talkyng as they eten
and drynken / For thou ought to speak to the point when it is time

Coniugis irate noli tu verba timere Nam lacrimis struit infidias dum femina
plorat
THou ought not to doubt the words of thy wife when she is wroth with the
/ for the wymmen been of such condycion that the more that they show them
wroth and full of wepynges and syghynges / so much more strongly they enforce
and enuertuen them for to deceive the and to take the in their grynnes / and
this they done when they see that by their wepynges syghynges and words they
may not overcome their husbondes / The woman ought to be subgett^^ to the man
/ and therefore thou ought not to doubt her for none thing that she does
or says / Saint crisostom says that one may chastyse his wife in two manners /
First in prayeng her swetety / and showing to her / her fawte by sweet words /
Secondly when she will not be chastysed ne amend her self by sweet words /
thou ought to smite and chastyse her with a good staff / but alwayees thou
ought to keep thy self fro the subtiltees and decepcions of thy wife when she
is evil and a shrewe / for the holy scripture says that there ne is heed so
evil ne so peryllous as the heed of a serpente / ne there nys so evil ire / as
the ire of a woman / for she is right bold and hardy for to do that she
thinks / and right subtyl for to let sum wha^ she will / for when she is
wroth she dare say and do that / that a man durst not do ne think it / for
it is the most wonderful and meruayllous be that is living when she is
wro^^he / and the most cruel / and of other part she is the most sweet be
that is living and most pyteous when she is good and wythouten wrath / we
reden that a woman by cause that her husbonde bet^^ her / bethoughte h^^ / that
she should give ^^o him a drink / of the which he wexyd and became drunk /
and as out of his wit / and as she thought and purposed hit / she did and
performed hit / Then when she had given to him this drink he became a fool
in so much that he wist not what he did / then she enbraced him (...) him
upon his bed / and after she ran unto a mynste^^ / ^^hyche was nyghe by /
and began for to call and cry as she had be al mad saying / Alas for
gods love come to socour me and to help my pour husbonde which deyeth and
has as of now lost his speech / alas when he was in his good health he ne
demanded of god other thing / but that he might become a monk / and I of the
other part have vowed chasty^^e and yet I vow hit of present / I will not
let ne empes^^e his sauemente / alas said she come ye lyghtlye and put on him
thabbyte of relygyon / to the end that he accomplysshe his auowe and that he
deye relygyous / Then the monks came thither and made him a great crown /
and after they put on him thabbyce of relygyon in the best wise that they
could / For he could not speak nor know no person living / And then when
the morn came that his dronkeshyp and fransye was passed / he beheld him self
and was al abashed when he found him self in a monks habyte / ne who had put
hit on him / ne made him so great a crown / Then his wife said to him alas
my right dear husbonde whereof (...) basshed / are you not remembryd how
yesternyght ye were made a monk when ye were in your great fransye / ye know
well that it is long a goo sithe ye made your auowe unto God to become a monk
/ Therefore I have sent for the monks which have ordained you unto a monk /
and to the end that I ne let nor empesshe your vow and your sauemente I have
promised and vowed to god chastyte / in such manner that I must be al allone
pour and as lost in this world / Of these words was sore abashed the pour
husbonde / and said to her that he knew no thing of that she said / ne that
he had no will for to be a monk / and would have taken aweye thabbyte fro
him / alas said his wife how are ye so hardy and so bold to put your habyte
aweye fro you and to kreke your vow ye will dampne both me and you also / For
I will well that ye know that never ye ne shall have felawshyp with me / for ye
are a very monk / and god forbede that I lie with any monk / and also ye
know well that if ye leave your habyte all the world shall mocque and wonder upon
you / and every one should say that ye were a postate / and all the world should
flee and void your felawshyp / by cause that ye were cursyd / So much and so
long she preached him that by her wit and fair words he entered in to the
order and relygyon / and gafe in her all his goods /

Ptete quesitis opibus sed ne videaris abuti Qui sua consumunt cum deest aliena
sequntur
THou ought to dyspende thy goods by mesure with out making of excess /
to the end that men sayen not that thou abusest them / also over nygarde thou
ought not to be / But thou ought to keep the myddel way For thou
ought not to be neither ouerlarge ne over scarce by cause that when the
goods fayllen many euyls often folowen thereof / and therefore every man ought to
keep him fro consumyng and dyspendyng of his goods folysshly / many euyls may
come by pouerte and by dyspendynges of goods without mesure / first the
spyrytuel goods ben therefore dyspreysed / and of the saints of paradyse they
setten not by / Secondly they are vergoynous and shameful to demand the bread
of god that men give for his sake / Thyrdly by pouerte they done many sins /
as is theft murdre and many other /

Fac tibi proponas mortem non esse timendam Que bona si non est tamen finis
illa malorum
THou ought not to doubt the death for the pains that folowen / that is to
wete that thou must do so (...) in this world that thou doubtest not the death
/ for though she be not good / that is to wete that she is not reputed for good
/ Nevertheless she is the end of all euyls and myseryes of this world /
Semblably men may say that the death is good as well for the evil folk as for
the good / for by the death the evil folk leave their contynuance and making of
sins / therefore is death good to them and prouffytable / But she is better to
the good folk as the psalmyste says / Which says that the death of saints
is right good and right precious /

Vxoris linguam si frugi est far memento Nam malum est non velle pati ne
posse tacere
THou ought to bear and to suffer debonayrlye the words of thy wife / when
they are prouffytable for the or for other / for it is ageynste right and
reason to keep no pees / but always though thy Wife be accustomed for to lie /
when she says true thou ought to escuse her benygnelye / and when she
spekyth evil / thou ought to chastyse her swetelye and to say to her
frendely that she should keep h^^r pees / The phylosophre says / that not
wythstondyng that the counceyl of wymmen be reputed of no valewe /
nevertheless when she says her oppynyon and gives her counceyll forthwyth
without to think tofore thereon / that she ought to say / men find it often
good and prouffytable and of great vtylyte /

Dilige non egra caros pietate parents Nec matrem offendas du^ vis bonus esse
parenti
THou ought to love thy fader and thy mother by good and true love Without
any faynyng / for it is great abusyon to anger his mother when he will be good
and be byloued of his fader / for he that shall do evil to his fader or to his
mother / in the end hit shall myshappe to him and he shall deye pour and unhappy /
The gospel says that if thou will lyu^^ long on earth thou must honor and
love both thy fader and mother / or else hit may be so exposed / Thou ought
not to anger thy mother / that is to wete holy church when thou Wylt be good
and be byloued of thy fader / that is to wete god thy creator which is fader
of al / Item it is one of the pryncypal commandments of our law / that is
to wete thou shalt worship god thy creator / thy fader and thy mother / after
the first commandment that says that thou ought to believe and love one
only god /

Incipit liber quartus
Securam quicunque cupis deducere vitam Nec vicijs haerere animum quae moribus
obsunt
tHOu ought to coueyte and desire oueral to lead good life and sure in this
world and to keep thy self fro falling in to sin / For thou ought of all
thy might to flee al vices and sins which are contrary unto good connycyons
and cause of the dampnacyon and losyng of both body and soul / for / for no
thing none ought not to leave him to be surmounted or ouercomen of sins /

Haec precepta feresque su^t relegenda memento Inuenies aliquid quod te vitare
magistro
tHou ought to set and to have in thy mind the commandments beforesayd
which thou ought often to read / for if thou consyderest well the foresaid
commandments and them that folowen herafter thou shalt find in them sum
things that shall be to the good and prouffytable for the governance as well of
thy soul as of thy body / and what thing thou ought to do and follow / and
which thing thou must flee and eschew / for in the place there as vice and
sin reygneth and has domynacyon / virtue may not abide in no manner / by
cause that they be contrary /

Despice diuicias si vis animo esse beatus Quas qui suscipiunt mendicant semper
auari
tHou ought to dyspreyse the rychesses of this world if thou will be well
happy and live surely for to acquyre the glory of paradyse which is eternal /
For they that have most of hit / ben ever more pour and more auarycyous than
the other / Therefore says the gospel / if thou will be parfyte and welhappy
in this world / goo thou and selle all that thou have in this world and give hit
for gods sake to the pour membris of christ / Saint austyn says that the
auarycyous may never have no suffysaunce / for the more that he has the more
he will have / and he is never assured / for he dredeth ever / Saint austyn
says that the auarycyous doubten the four elements / first they doubt the
water / to the end that hit drown not their marchaundyses / Item they doubten
the fire / left that hit brenne their howses and possessions / thyrdly they
doubten therthe / to the end that their fruytes perysshe not fourthly they
doubten the wind / to the end that by wyndes and rain they be not let ne
empesshed for to goo and do their marchaundyses / Item they doubten al
persons / lest that they should stele their goods / but tho that haten the
rychesses doubten no thing saufe only god their creator /

Commoda nature nullo tibi tempora deerunt Si contentus eo fueris quod postulat
vsus
tHou ought to be content of the goods and prouffytes that nature and
vsaunce of time gives to the / for if thou be content and have suffysaunce /
the goods and prouffytes of nature shall never faylle to the / for thou
ought not to require nor demand of god / but that which is vtyle and
prouffytable to the for to sustain nature humayn Boece says that nature is
contented of little / Therefore we ought to desire and demand first of god the
goods spiritual / For he that has the spyrytual goods ought to have hope
and to believe stedfastlye that he shall have enough of temporalle goods / For
it is seen selde / the Just to dekaye ne to have need in such manner / but
that he has ever good enough for to feed and sustain his life naturalle /

Cum sis incautus nec rem racione gubernes Noli fortunam que non est dicere
cecam
tHou ought not to say that fortune is blind which is no thing / but by
cause that thou art a fool and evil gouernest and rewlest the / for fortune is
not blind though the poets sayen and faynen her to be blind / but as the
wise man says thou ought to have in thy mind pouerte in time of
haboundaunce / that is to wete when thou art full and rich / thou ought to
keep and spare so^me goods for the time yet to come / Boece de consolacyon
says that fortune is no thing / but that as the people comyne ymagyne and
supposen / for fortune is no thing else / but only ymagynacion and fantasye
/ and therefore When thou mysrew^^est thy self / thou ought not to say ne to
call fortune blind nor evil / for she is no thing but ymagynacion and
folysshe believe /

Diglie denarium sed parce dilige formam Quam nemo sanctus nec honestus captat
habere
tHou ought to love the money only for the fedyng and susteynyng of thy
life / that is to wete moderatelye and for to have and bye that which is
necessary for thy corporal life / for no holy man nor Just out not to demand
but only that / that is nedeful and necessary for his substance and
corporalle life / and not to do as these vserers which assemblen and gadren
these great tresours whereof they make their gods and their ydolles / for they
trust more in their gol^de and silver than in god their maker / For as says
the scripture auaryce is none other thing but seruyces and worshyppynges of
ydolles / We reden of an auarycyous man which had much gold and silver /
Which on a day took his tresour and laid hit in the mids of his chamber
upon a fair clothe / and called to him his wife and his sone and showed to them
his tresour / and after he made them to goo out of the chamber and shette the
door / but yis sone held him without at the door and looked thorugh a little
hole in to the chamber / and saw that his fader knelid before his tresoure and
worshypped hit / saying ye be mine hope my glory and al my reffuge / for I ne
demand nor require help nor socour of none other god than of you / the
which man saying these words leyed him down al alonge on his tresour / and
emonge all the pyeces of gold he saw one which was fair and bryghte / to
whom he said / thou art much fair / I suppose and believe that thou art
much good for to ete / the which took and put hit in his mowthe and ete hit /
and yet ageyn he saw another pyece of gold which was gretter and fayrer than
the other beforesayd / and he took and ete hit as he did the other / Item he saw
another yet gretter than any of them both beforesayd and more fayrer / which
he supposed to have swolowed as he did the other / but by cause that it was
over large and thycke hit choked him / and after was his soul put and buried
in hell / and was found deed upon his (...) as a be / without fawte thus
shall hit happen to al them which louen their tresour more than god their
creator / and more than their bodies and fowls /

Cum fuetis locuples corpus curare memento Eger dives habet nummos sed non
habet seipsum
tHou ought to medecyne and do to be medecyned thy body when thou art
rich and mighty for to keep thy body in good health / for the rich man has
his rychesses and his silver to his will when it pleases him / but he has
not his body ne his health nor him self at his will / We have ensaumple of a
rich man which had lever for to lose one of his eyes / than for to give a
floryn to a physycyen for to help him / and of the other part it is found that
many one would rather deye / than they should give one penny for the health of
their bodies for to medecyne them / and this is that the wise man says / if
thou art evil and contrary to thyn own self how shalt thou be good toward
the other strangers / therefore hit apperyth clearly that the auarycyous haven
no charge ne retchen not of them self / though they have many of worldly
rychesses /

Verbera cum tuleris discens aliquando magistri Fer patris imperium cum verbis
exit in iram
tHou ought to bear and to suffer pacyently the correccion or chastysyng of
thy master if thou wylt learn well / semblably when thy fader is angry thou
ought to hold thy pees and to answer humbly and to do his commandments /
for by thy sweet words and meke answer / thou shalt pease his ire / For the
common proverb says / that sweet word refrayneth great ire / and thus if thou
have sometime suffered the betynges of thy master when thou dyddest learn /
semblably and more strong reason ought to suffer and to bear / the words
of thy fader when he is wroth / The phylosophre says that there ben three
persons to the which we may not render ne yield the goods that they have
done to us / First to god which has given to us our being and soul reasonable
and wit / the which we oughten to love and to doubt by cause that he has
made and created us when we were not Item he has boughte us ageyn when we were
lost / And has given to us wit and understanding / for to dyscerne the good
from the evil /

Secondly to the master that lernyd and taught the science and doctrine / For
for all the tresour in the world me^^ should not mow bye neither wysdom ne
science / Thyrdly to thy fader and to thy mother which have given unto the thy
being / and al thyn hole membris natural / who were he that should mow bye one
eye or one hand / who should be he that should mow bye science / ne who should
be he that should mow save yt but only god thy creator / all the tresour of the
world should not do it / and therefore none should not mow render or yield the
well that these three persons beforesayd have done unto us /

Res age que profunt rursus vitare memento Inquibus error inest nec spes est
certa laboris
tHou ought to do things prouffytable and vtyle and to flee them that are
vnutyle / contrary and with out prouffyte / For it is folly for to do thing
that prouffyteth naught to the ne to other / ne of which men have no hope of
sum prouffyte / in time present / ne for to come / Item hit ne suffiseth not
for to do al only the things which ben to the prouffytable / but also to the
other /

Quod donare potes gratis concede roganti Nam recte fecisse bonis in part
lucrosum est
tHou ought sone to give to him that demands and requires of the if thou
have whereof and may do hit after thy faculte and might / and ought for to
give things well acquyred and gotten of thyn own / For of no things evil
gotten none may not lycytly give / our to do any alms / and if thou gyuest
Justly of thy goods thou shall be partyner to the wynnyng and prouffyte / and
shall be rewarded of hit before god thy creator in the other world / and also
perauenture in this world / There ben sum simple folk that wenen that hit is
well done for to rob a rich usurer for to give to the pour people /
Certeynlye such thought is wicked and deuylly / and they do not Well thereof /
For though they given all that they robben of the rich yet done they more
sins / than alms / as witnesses right canon and the holy scripture /
Therefore every man ought for to give of his own and propre good Iustlye and
lawfully gotten /

Quod tibi suspectu^ confestim discute quid sid Namque solent primo que sunt
neglecta nocere
tHou ought sone to dyscute and inquire the truth of the things doubtous
and suspecious in all the works and deeds which thou will do and begin /
for thou ought for to know of hit the certeynte or thou procedest any
ferther / and ought for to see and look what thereof may follow / For often
the things of which men doubten not of / and of which they have no charge ne
retchen not for to know the truth nor to what end it may come / ben sometime
right greuable and dommages / and comen thereof many Inconuenyentes / to the
which if men had purueyed in time had not mow grown ne borne no dommage /
Therefore says the common proverb that evil aduysed has often pain /

Cu^ te detineat veneris dampnosa voluptas Indulgere gule noli que ventris
amica est
tHou ought to be sobre of mete and drink if thou will flee the sin ot
lecherye / specially when thou art enclyned and abandonned unto the said sin
for the mowthe is byloued of the belly / wherefore thou ought for to keep thy
mowthe from ouermoche wynes and meets so that hit be not cause of thy sin /
For when thou art enclyned to the said sin / thou ought to fast and to
ymagen all the ways and manners whereby thou shall best mow chastyse thy flesh
fro evil desires lecherous / whereof comen many euylles

Cum tibi preponas animalia cancta timere Vnum precipne hominem plus esse
timendum
tHou ought to dread the man more than any other be living / though thou
have purposed in thy wit for to doubt all the other beestys / to the end that
they do not to the no harm / yet always thou ought to doubt more the man
than any other be / by cause that the man is made and formed to the image
and semblaunce of god / and also by cause that in to the service of man been
made and created al beestys / Item by cause that the man has within him self
more of science subtyltee and cautele than any other be / Saint austyn says
that god created first the man racyonel / to the end that he should understand
the souerayn well that god his creator had done to him and given / and also
that he should serve and love him With al his heart and thought so that he
might come to the pardurable glory of paradyse /

Cum tibi preualide fuerint in corpore vires Fac sapias animo si tu poteris vir
fortis hab^eri
tHou ought to learn and acquyre science / sith god has given to the wit
and understanding to do hit / For if thou have wysdom and sapyence within the
/ thou shalt be reputed and holden for strong and for worthy and valyaunte /
Therefore says salamon that wysdom and sapyence been more worth and more
prouffytable than the force and valyaunce corporell / For the man prudente and
wise is better worth than the man strong anth valyaunte of his members / and
therefore thou ought for to learn science for to tempere and to modere the
might corporalle /

Auxilium a notis petito si forte laboras Nec quisquam melior medicus qua^
fidus amicus
tHou ought to demand counceyl and help of thy friends when thou art
fall in to sum fortune or need / to the end that they comfort and counceyl
the in thy myserye and fortune / for there nys no better a medecyne than the
good and feythful friend / for as the medecyne is vtyle and prouffytable for to
hele al sekenesses / thus a good friend is good and vtyle for to help and
comfort his friend in his fortune and trybulacyon / and there nys no thing
that men oughten to hate so much ne to have in anger and ire / than him that
is enemy when he feyneth and shows sign and token to be friend / For they
oughten better to love a very friend than gold or silver or other worldly
goods / It is found in the scryptures three manners of diverse friends / First
sum ben the worldly friends / by cause that they love the vanytees and
Inyquytees of this world / The second ben the friends of the devil / for such
friends louen but for to do evil / The third ben the friends of god / by cause
that they love god and obseruen and keep his commandments /

Cum sis ipse nocens moritur cur victima pro te Stulticia est in morte alterius
sperare salutem
tHou ought not to make sarefice unto god of dombe beestys / ne to have hope
in the de^^he of them / as had thauncyente which made sacrefyse to god of
dombe beestys / For they had in this all their feythe and believe /

Certeynlye it is greter folly for to have hope of salvation for the love of
sum creature than al only in the death of Ihesu christ thy redemptour / For
no synnar ought not to suppose for to have pardon nor remyssyon of his sins
by other death / than only by the death and blessed passion of Ihesu christ /
It is read in the holy scripture that the auncyents erryd folysshly and hadden
a folysshe oppynyon / For they slew diverse beestys of the which they made
sacrefyse to god / and byleuyd that by the death of beestys god gafe to them
pardon / and thou ought to know that such folysshe cerymonyes that the
auncyentes maad been put now down and set at naught by the new law of our
redemptour Ihesu christ and by the death and passion of Ihesu christ ben put
and brought to naught al such errors / by cause that the very feythe and
believe c^^me forth in the coming of our Lord Ihesu christ /

Vtere quefitis opibus sed fuge nomen auari Quid tibi diuicie prosu^t si pauper
habundas
tHou ought to dyspende thy goods by such manner that men sayen not that
thou art a nygarde and auarycyous / that is to wete in doing almesses / and
with them with whom it is expedyente for to dyspende and to give / What should
auaylle to the a great tresoure or a garette full of whete or a celer full of
wine / if hit were so that neither to thy self nor to none other thou sholdest
not take nor give sum what thereof / certeynlye all this should auaylle the
no thing / but should be lettyng and chargeable both to thy soul and to thy
body / and sholdest be thereof blamed and dyspreysed of the world / For every
man should say that thou were a nygard^^ and that thou sholdest deye pourely
beside or nyghe thy goods / Saint Iherome says cursyd be al tho which lyuen
only / to the end that they may gadre and assemble worldly rychesses which
are so sone passed / and that are so transytorye and of so little valewe / and
by the which they l^^se the rychesses if great valewe and eternal without
end /

Si famam seruare cupis dum viuis honestam Hac fugias animo que sunt mala
gaudia vite
If thou will have and keep good fame or renomee in this world / thou ought
to flee al vices and sins for the evil joys and worldly plesures been often
cause and mater^^ of evil renomee / and in the end of dampnacyon perpetual / The
wise man says that the good renomee and good preysyng is better than all the
rychesses and tresoures of this world / by cause that the good and famous name
endures longer than the rychesses /

Dum sapias animo noli irridere senectam Na^ quocumque seen sensus puerilis in
illo est
tHou ought not to mocque and scorn old age / that is to wete the old and
ancient folk / though thou be wise / and that god has given to the wit and
understanding for to rewle and govern the wisely / for thou sholdest be
therefore blamed of al men that have wit and understanding For as Job says
sapyence comes and grows in man within short time / but prudence comes by
^^nge space of time and prolongeth thexperyence of the wise m^^n / In every
old man is sapyence / but by sum accidents and wantynges of nature
thauncyent retournen and becomen as children been in their yongthe / and every
old man has comynly the manners and countenaunces of a child / therefore men
ought not to mocque them / but ough^^en to suffer pacyently their fawtes and
their symplenesse / for thou must consydere that without any fawte thou must
come to such estate or else to deye in thyn young age /

Disce aliquid nam cum subito fortuna recedit Ars remanet vitamque hominis non
dese rit vnquam
tHou ought to learn sum craft or sum science for teschewe fortune
which sodaynlye departs and goes fro the / but thy craft or connyng shall
never leave the unto the time of death / but if by fortune thou losest thy
worldly goods / by thy craft or connyng thou myghtest recover and get hem
ageyn / but if thou had neither co^nyng nor craft at al / and fortune were
to the contrary thou sholdest abide pour and mysheaunte and myghtest fall in
to many Inconuenyentes and perils both of body and of soul / It is said in
a common proverb / that craft is better / than the sparhawke / Item craft and
science eschewen great Inbygence / and taken the man from great myserye and
danger /

Prospicito cuncta tacitus quoth quisque loquatu^^ Sermo hominum mores celat et
iudicat idem
tHou ought to hold thy pees and ^^o be moderate / and to look and herke
what every man shall say / and to note and set hit in thyn understanding / for
by the words of the folk thou shalt mow understand and know their co^nyng
and prudence / and their fol^^e^^e mauayste / ^^or of haboundaunce of the heart
the mow^^e speaks and says what the heart thinks Therefore says the gospel
/ Ha thou evil man I Judge and condemn the by thy mowthe and by thy words /
for comynlye every person says and speaks as he thinks / The good person
says never but well / and the evil and wicked says ever evil / and therefore by
the words of the folk men known their condycyons whether they be good or
auyl /

Excerce studiu^ qua^uis percepe^^is a^^tem Vt cura ingenium fit et manus
adiuuat vsum
tHou ought to excercyce and follow the study though that thou have the
art and science of many things / for right so as al crafts which is used
daily renders and makes the hand able and ready for to excercyse and do
lightly the said craft / In like wise by often studyeng and to haunte the
study and the clerkys / men able them in what someuer science that it be / and
they acquyren the usage of al arts and scyences for to use and study them
often / For hit is much better to have the art or the experyence of sum
science or craft / than to have the science without experyeence or use / what
should avail to the thy science or thy craft if thou can not use and help
thy self therwyth / and thou ought to study in such manner and so long
that thou may get and acquyre the experyence and use of the connyng or
craft of the which thou purposest for to help thy self /

Multum venturi ne cures tempora fati Ne mortem metuit qui scit contempnere
vitam
tHou ought not to have cure ne retche for ^^enquyre of thy fortune ne when
thou sholdest have hit / nor of many other things of which enquyren many
simple folk / that will know the secrets of god / for none may know such
things / but by deuyne reuelacyon / For he that can dyspreyse this life mortal
and do good werkys / and to keep the commandments of god / doubts not the
death / and he gives not force nor retcheth not for to know his fortune / ne
when he shall deye / For he sets all in god his creator which knows all
things / The wise man says that the naturalle death is none other thing /
but the coming out of a prison / for to come in to the hows / Item the death is
end of al exylyng and banysshyng / for to come in to fraunchyse and at lyberte
/ Item death is consumacyon and end of al pain and labor for to come to
rest of life / Item she is eschewyng of al evil / for to have al goods / Item
death is despoylyng and alegeaunce of a right great and heavy far^^el / that is
to wete of our flesh / Item death natural is none other thing / but way and
connyng for to goo and return in to his land / that is to wete in to the
glory of paradyse / and therefore none ought to doubt the death naturelle
when he is of good living / and that he keeps the commandments of god his
creator and maker / but of the death eternal is all the contrary / for every
man ought to doubt hit above all things /

Disce sed a doctis indoctos ipse doceto Propagada est etenim rerum doctrina
bonarum
Hou ought to take and learn thy science and thy gouernemente of the wise
men / and after thou ought to teache to the ygnorauntes good condycyons and
good doctrynes / that is to wete how they ought for to rewle and govern them /
and how be it that it is good for to learn of every man / Nevertheless the
science and doctrine of wise men is more prouffytable and better than of other
/ and therefore when thou have learned well and have had good counceyl of the wise
men / after this thou ought for to learn and teache the ygnoraunte / he
techeth and lerneth him self when he techeth and endoctryneth the other / by
cause that no science ne none art or craft may not endure long wythouten
use and excercyce / that is to wete without hit be used and ocupyed oftymes
For use and practyke maken the scyences and crafts for to grow and endure /
The phylosophre says that there ben two things which are of no prouffyte /
that is to wete the tresour which is closed and hid in therthe / and the
connyng which is enclosed and shette within man / without to be used
practyked communyked and taught to the other /

Hoc bibe quoth possis si tu vis viuere sanus Morbi causa mali namque est
quecu^que voluptas
tHou outest to drink the wine in manner that thou be not hurt therwyth / for
thou must take of hit but as much as suffiseth to thy complexion if thou wylt
live in health both of body and soul / for dronkshyp and all superfluyte of
wine ben cause of lecherye and of many euyls and sekenesses and also of many
stryues and dyscencyons / He that takes the wine by mesure and temperately
prouffyteth to him much and to him does much good / First hit causes good
color naturelle / Item it causes good dygestyon / Item hit keeps the mete
within the body fro corupcion / Item hit boylleth the mete within the stomach
and purefyeth and ledeth hit by all the members of the body / till hit be
converted and turned in to pure / clean and subtyl blood / Item hit makes the
heart ioyeful / Item hit comfort and opens the wit and understanding of
the person / Item hit makes man to speak well and hardely / and causes good
appetyte in all things /

Laudaris quodcunque palam quodcunque probaris Hoc vide ne rurfus leuitatis
crimine dampnes
tHou ought never to blame ne dyffame what someuer person the which thou
shalt have preysed and approved openly to be good and just / Ne also other
thing what someuer hit be / For hit were sign or token of Inconstaunce / and
yet ageyn thou myghtest be repreuyd of the crime and blame to be to light and
Inconstaunte / and every man should say that thou sholdest bow with al wyndes
/ that is to say / that in the should not be steadfastness ne no trust / and by
so thou sholdest be defiled and dyspreysed of al persons / we reden of four
phylosophres which dysputed and argued togyders of thynconstaunce and
mutabylyte of the things / The first said that the most Inconstaunte and
most mutable thing in this world was the woman / The second said that it was
the wind / The third said that it was the light / the fourth said that it was
the man's heart / and this last oppynyon was approved and found true / To
this purpoos says saint gregorye that there nys thing so mutable as is the
heart and thought of the man /

Tranquillis rebus quo sunt aduersa caueto Rebus in aduersis melius sperare
memento
tHou ought to eschew and flee the contrary things when thou art in good
prosperyte and in good fortune / and to consydere how men have great pain for
to get and acquyre the goods / and great dysplesure and malencolye to lose
them / and yet ageyn if by adventure thou come fro prosperyte in to aduersyte
/ thou ought for to have hope that thou shalt have better in time yet to
come and more of goods than ever thou had / for the goods and euyls comen
sodaynlye / The poets feynen that the goddess Syrces said that she was
daughter of the son / and by her they understood the prosperyte of this world
/ and sayen that on a day vlyxes being upon the sea saw the palace fro far
of the goddess Syrces / but this goddess had such prosperyte and propyrtee
that she turned the folk in to such form as she would / Then the said
vlyxes sent sum of his felawes in to the said paleys of Syrces for to bye
mete and such things as they neded / but when the goddess saw them she made
semblaunte to receive them ioyously and to make hem good chere / the which
made sone the tables to be leyed and couerd and gafe to them both mete and
drink / and as soon as they had dronken of the drink that she gafe unto them
/ they were turned in to the figure of suynes / then when vlixes saw that
his felawes came not ageyn / he yede forth unto the paleys for to speak with
the goddess / and demanded of her where his felawes were become which he had
sent unto her for to have had such things as they neded / but without
answer the said Syrces presented to him the cup for to drink the which
drink vlyxes refused / and so he was kept fro the figure and form of a
swyne / and did so much by fair words that the said goddess took him to
her husbonde / And therefore she made his felawes to become men ageyn as they
were before / and when the said vlixes had dwelled a year with the said
goddess / he and his felawshyp returned in to his contreye and left the
goddess sirces great with child / the which child thas named thelagonus /
the which afterward by ygnoraunce slew his fader vlyxes / To speak morally /
by this goddess thou must understand the prosperyte of this world which is
like the sea / And by the felawes of the said Vlyxes which were turned in to
swynes thou ought to understand them that come to the prosperyte of this
world / the which as soon as they have dronken of the delyces of this world /
ben turned and fygured in to the form of swynes / that is to say that by
their vices and sins they lose the use and knowledge of rayson and
understanding / and becomen as swynes or other dombe beestes / But when
Vlyxes comes / that is to wete the wise man and prudent he keeps him self well
fro drinking of the delyces of this world / And thus he may well be married
with the said goddess / that is to wete with the prosperyte of this world /
and that more is / they that are turned in to swynes that is to wete they that
have lost rayson / the which man by sweet words and ensamples makes hem to
return in to Reason that is to wete in to their first figure /

Discere ne cesses cara sapiencia crescit Rara datur longo prudencia temporis
vfu
THou ought not to cesse fro learning / though that thou be of hard wit /
For by contynuacion and to study strongly / thou shall mow acquyre great
connyng and prudence / For men have but l^ytell science and prudence if it come
not by long vsaunce and long contynuacion / For it is Impossyble for to
acquyre science and prudence / ne none other art ne craft within little time /
For hit is of need / that such scyences and arts comen by long contynuacion
/ Therefore said a wise Senator of Rome that if he had one foot in his grave /
yet would he ever learn / as he would say / that all science is gotten and
acquysyte by contynuacion and long use

Parce laudato nunquam tu sepe probaris Vna dies qualis fuerit monstrabit amicus
THou ought to preyse thy friends by mesure unto the time that thou have
approuued them / that is to wete / unto the time / that thou have true
experyence that they ben thy friends / and by especialle that thou have
approuued them in parylle of death / For men known wh^^^e ^^ey are in parylle
of death / he that is a true friend / Therefore ^^ou ought by mesure and
temperatly to preyse thy friend / For the day shall come / that he which thou
have preysed shall show if he be thy friend or not / And if he be such / as
thou had do supposed / The signs or toknes of very love ben showed in four
manners / First by words / for when the person has the heart fulle of
hertelysshe love / the mouth then speaks habundauntly and affectuelly / For
it is said comynly / that by thabundaunce of the heart / the mouth speaks
Secondly men know true love by yeftes and the same token is gretter than the
first / For many one hel^peth other by words that should not help of his
goods / Thyrdly one knows his friend by the seruyse that he does with his
person / And the same is yet gretter than any of the both tokens before said
/ For many men shall help other both of their words and goods / that would
not serve of their person / as Jacob did / which served fourten year for his
friend Rachel / Fourthly men known their friend in aduersyte and paryll of
death / And the same sign or token is gretter / than any of the other before
said / For they may not find gretter token of love / For many one should
habondonne their persons in the seruyse of their friend / that would not put
their bodies in ^^o the peril of death / For none may show gretter charity /
than to put in parylle of death his body and his soul for his friend / As did
a Senator of Rome called papinia / of which recounteth Valere in his book /
For right so as men proves the gold in the fornays / Right so they prouue
their friend in aduersyte / For many one be founden which are only friends at
the table / that is to say at dinner and souper / and not in aduersyte /

Ne pudeat que nescieris te velle doceri Scire aliquid laus est pudor est nil
discere velle
THou ought not for to have shame ne vergoyn if an other techeth the that
thou can not / Care thou not of whom thou lernest / but that thou may
know / for hit is gretter honor and praysynge and right gre^^e prouffyt for
to conne sum thing / And by the contrary / is great dishonor and right
great dommage to know no thing / ne to will ought learn / It were great
folly to a man servant and in the danger of all the world / if he had lever
to be prisoner and in seruytude all the days of his life / than to demand
grace and mysericorde and fredome / certainly it were great folly / thou wost
well / that science is fontayne of all goods / And Ignorance is fontayne and
mother of all euyls

Cum venere et bacho lis est et iuncta voluptas Quod iustum est animo
complectere sed fuge lites
THou ought to flee dronkeship and lechery and al her voluptuosites / For by
dronkeship and lecherye comen many and Infynyte euyls and inconuenients / by
cause that there as regneth dronkeship and lecherye / may never be good pees ne
concord / For there as dronkeship and lecherye regnen / ben none other / but
voluptuosytees stryues and debates / Therefore thou must flee dronkeship and
lecherye / and be sobre in metes and drynkes / and in all things that might
trouble thyn understanding and courage / And thus thou shall eschew al
stryues and debates / and al evil voluptuosytees / And also al evil and carnal
desires / And know thou that the work man that is drunk of customme shall
never be rich ne puyssaunt / The wise man says / that by wyn and by wymmen
comen many euyls and inconuenyents / first by wyn comes lecherye / stryf and
debate murdre theft and many other infynyte euyls / Item by a woman comes
ydolatry / as thou have ensample of Salamon / which adoured the ydolles for
the love of a woman / Item by women have be many wise men brought unto folly /
as was Arystotle that suffered him to be ryden of a woman / And to have the
brydell in his mouth as he had be a horse / Item by wymmen many have been
deceived and begyled many / as vyrgyle that was hanged by a woman at a wyndowe
within the Cite of Rome / the which woman promised to him for to have drawn
him up in to her chamber / but when he was half upward / fro the ground unto
her chamber she left him there so hanging unto the morrow next / in so
much that every man might see him who so would

Dimissos animo tacitos vitare memento Quo flumen est placidum forsan latet
alcior vnda
THou ought to flee them that speken but lytyl and sobrely / that is to say
tho that speken symply / feynyng thypocrysye / For such folk ben full of
malice and of falshede / as thou see that the flood which is stylle and
renneth not is often more deep and more peryllous / than that same which
renneth strongly / Tullius says in his book that men oughten to doubt more
them that speken little and symply as maidens and ypocrites than them that
speken boldly and soon / and that sayen clearly all that they think and have
in their hertes without making of any fyctions / ne ypocrysye /

Cum tibi displiceat rerum fortuna tuarum Alterius specta quo sis discrimine
peior
THou ought not to take to dysplaysyr the loss and fortune of thy goods /
and if by adventure thou have displesau^ce of the fortune of thy goods
considere and look well and thou shall find / yt many one that are better than
thy self art / have nothing / and that demaunden their bread for gods sake
/ Item thou shall find and may know daily / that many that are Just and of
good life / and better than thou art lose often al their goods by fortune / and
comen unto great myserye and pouerte / And therefore if thou considere and look
well on all these things / thou shall have pacyence of the loss and
Infortune of thy goods / Therefore says Right that it is joy and solas to the
pour meschaunts and Infortunat for to have felauship /

Quod potes id tempta nam litus carpere remis Tucius est multo quam velum
tendere in altum
THou ought to proune and to assaye thy self for to do that thou may do
/ and to abide and led hit to good end and perfection / For when thou
he^^ynnest and enterprysest for to do sum thing / thou ought to look the
begynynge / the myddel / and the end / that is to wete that when thou
enterprysest for to do any thing / hit is more sure for to hold the myddel
way / and common estate after thy might and puyssaunce / than for to enhaunce
thy self so hyhe / that thou must descend or fall down / For it is grette
honor to be enhaunced upward / but it is great dyshonoure to descend / and to
be cast dounward / Item thou ought not for to begin a thing that thou
may not bring to an end / For hit is great vergoyne and shame for to leave a
thing vnparfyghte / It is said comynly / that who ouerladyth him self / shall
not bear far his fardell / Therefore ben they well happy / that goo and holden
the myddell weye / For who that enhaunceth him self more than he ought / he
shall fall down from hyher than h^^ ne would / And therefore it is more sure
for to lead his ship with oores unto the Ryuage / than for to have up his
saylle and goo and led hit in to the hyhe (...) / ^^hat is to say / that it
is more sure to lead the myddell stat^^ / than for to row in to the hyhe see /
being in parylle to be drowned

Contra hominem iustum praue contendere noli Semper etenim deus iniustas vlatur
iras
THou ought not to strive / ne to take debate against the man Just and
Innocente / for our lord punyssheth ever the ire and wrathes unjust /
specially / when they are done unjustly / and without cause against the Just
and Innocents / And hit is that the holy scripture says / Nevertheless when the
Just and Innocente ben Iniuryed and molested vndewly and without cause / they
ought to have pacyence and to pardonne and forgive all the men that have done
or said wrong to them / As did our lord which forgaf to them / that
crucyfyed / and put him unto death unjustly and without cause /

Ereptis opibus noli merere dolendo Sed gaude pocius si te contingat habere
THou ought not to weep ne to discomforte the when thou losest the Rychesses
and temporalle goods of this world / but thou ought to be ioyeful thereof
having desire and good will for to acquyre and get other goods in time to
come / For the rychesses of this world ben not our own / but owen to fortune /
by cause that they ben out of us / and all at adventure / Saint Ambrose says /
that we have no thing of our own / but that we bear with us / It is read of
a man / which was much discomforted and soroufull by cause that be had
lost his sone and his silver / the which demanded counceylle of a wise
philosophre for to wete what he should do / Then the philosophre said / weep
no more of that thou have lost thy sone / but be ioyeful and glad of that our
lord has given to the a sone / and that thou haste lost him / Item to this
that thou say that thou have lost thy silver / of this thou ought not to
weep / ne to have malen^^lye / For wete thou for truth / that thy Silver has
lost many one / And by adventure / if thou had not lost hit / it had lost
the / therefore care thou not of nothing / all is subgette to fortune /
therefore think for to win and get now good and to engendre and make now
children /

Est iactu^^a g^^auis que sunt amittere dampnis Sunt quedam que far decet
pacienter amicum
THou ought to suffer more for thy Friend / than for any other thing erthely
/ that is to say / though it is grievous thing to lose his goods /
nevertheless hit is gretter dommage / and that men oughten more to doubt of the
loss of their lawfulle and true friend / than for to lose all the goods and
Rychesses of this world / For one may well recouere the loss of his goods /
but he may not recouere the death of his good Friend / And notwithstanding /
that hit greueth one much for to lose his good / which he has acquyred / and
won with great pain and trauaylle / Nevertheless thou ought for to bear
and suffer more for thy lauful friend / than for the rychesses of this world /
which are transytorye / and so soon lost / All wise men and virtuous owen
(...) suffer four things for her virtuous frend^^ / First be owes to suffer
death / and be pryued of life corporal / Secon^^ly pryuacion of all worldly
goods / Thyrdly pryuacion of all dygnytees and offices / And fourthly
pryuacion of virtues /

Tempora longa tibi noli promittere vite Quocu^que ingrederis sequitur mors
corporis vmbra^
THou ought not to promytte to thy life / that thou shall live long / that
is to say / that thou shall not suppose ne promytte to thy life / that thou
shall live long / ne to have hope of long living / For thou ought to wete
/ that thou haste no morrow / And that the death is nyghe to the / And that
none may naught length his life / And in what someuer place / that thou ghost
/ the death follows the / as does the shadow of thy body which follows the
where someuer thou goo / The death and the life are as two rennars / which
rennen strongly one ageynste the other / the which fynden and mete soon both
together / For as soon as the man is borne / he renneth naturelly and
demands the death / For hit is nature / by cause that for to deye he is come
in to this world /

Thure deum placa vitulum five crescat aratro Ne credas placare deum dum cede
le^^atur
THou ought to pease god with encence and by good works and by good
oracions and prayers / and leave the calf for to grow and to draw the pl^^ugh
/ For thou ought not to suppose for to pease god by slaughter of beestes as
men dyd^^ in thauncyent law of Moses / For how be hit that it was commanded
that in the law of Moses for to make sacrefyce of beestes / Nevertheless this
commandment was but figure and mysterye of the new testament / by which /
are to us forboden and deffended such sacryfyces / For in the new testamente
we have commandment for to sacrefye to with encens which is odoryfyrous and
of sweet smelling / and for to pray god deuoutely by humble and devout
oracions and prayers /

Cede locum lesus fortune cede potenti Ledere qui potuit aliquando prodesse
valebit
THou ought to give place to fortune / and to thy better also / For if
fortune is of present contrary unto the / she shall mow help / and to be
profitable unto the in time to come / Item if a gretter than thy self vexes
or troubles the of present or now / he shall mow help the in time coming /
therefore thou outest to have pacyence and to bear patiently al fortune / for you
outest to bow with all wyndes yt is for to say / that thou must have pacyence
/ as well in aduersite as in prosperyte / And of this thou have experyence by
the copwebbe / which breketh often / by cause that he may not be bowed / ne
humble ageynste the wyndes / as does the reed / which boweth on all sides
as the wind blows hit /

Cumcquid peccaris castiga teipse subinde Vulnera dum sanas dolor est medicina
doloris
THou ought to chastyse the by thy own self of thy own sin / that is to
wete by true confession / For so as as a sore or an euylle is medycyne and
health of another sore or euylle / Right so penytence he^^h th^^ / that is to
say / when thou take and receyuest hi^^ (...) good heart / And that thou
have good and true contricion and repentance / And when thou have
acoomplysshed the penytence which the priest has given to the / For saint
gregorye says / that better hit is / for to suffer sum lytelle pain in this
mortal life / than for to suffer in the other world pain and tormente eternalle
/ Intollerabile and without end / Our sauyoure Ihesu Christ punyssheth sum
folk in this world for five causes / The first is / to the end / that by their
punycyon / the Just may have the gretter merit / as hit appyereth by Job /
and by Thobye / which were right Just / And nevertheless they have been sore
and grievously punysshed in this world / The Second is / to the end / that the
virtue be kept and deffended fro the sin of pride / As hit appyereth by
saint Powle / which was colaphysed / and beat by the Aungelle Sathanas / The
thyrdde is to the end that they chastyse them self of their sins / As hit
appyereth by Marye suster unto Moses / which was long time Leper / to the end
/ that she should chastyse her self of her sins / The fourth is to the end
that the glory and might of god may be manyfested / as it appie^^ed by the
child which was borne as blind / Of the which saint Johan speaks in this
manner / This child / neither his parents have not sinned / wherefore he ought
to have be borne blind / but he was borne al blind to the end / that the
works / that is to wete / the Miracles and the glory of our lord be
manyfested and showed on him / The fyfthe is that the beginning of pain and
of trybulacion be continued perpetuelly in them / as hit appears by Herodes
and by the Zodomytes that are / and shall ever be perpetuelly in to the pains
of hell with the dampened /

Dampnaris numquam post longu^ tempus amicum Nutauit mores sed pignora prima
memento
THou ought not of light to depart and leave thy friend / that is to wete /
whom thou have had by long space of time a good friend / And if he by any
manner has mysdone ageynste the / thou ought not soon to depart therefore
fro his friend ship / though that thoffence by him commysed ageynste the be
grievous and right strange And notwithstondynge that he has turned his
condycions and gretely mysdone ageynste the / Nevertheless thou must yet
remember within thy self the old love and the first friend ship that thou have
had in time passyd with him / For he may yet torn and change his euylle
conditions in to good conditions / The scripture says that he that is sometime
a good friend and not contynuelly / shall not be true friend for to socoure
the in thy trybulacion / when thou shalt have need of him /

Gracior officijs quo fis mage carior esto Ne nomen subeas quoth dicitur
officiperdi
Thou ought to be sweet / gracious and humble in thyn office or in thy
seruyse without to be proud to them / the which shall have somewhat to do
with the / and that shall do to the seruyse and playsyre / to the end that thou
be not reputed for unkind / proud or mysknowynge the good and seruyse which
they have done to the / Item also to the end that they sayen not that the name
which is called office lost is their own name / that is to say / that the
seruyse which they have done to the is l^^ste / Item also to the end / that
thou lesest not the office in the which thou art Instytued by thy pride and
unkindness For thou ought ever to be good and curtoys and to have mind
and knowledge of the goods and seruyses / that other have done do the /

Suspectus caueas ne fis miser omnibus horis Nam timidis et suspectis aptissima
mors est
THou ought not to be doubtous ne suspicious in what someuer manner that it
be / For he that is suspicionus / that is to wete when he trusts no body
he is meschaunt / And ever he shall be reputed for meschaunt and miserable /
And he shall never have pees ne rest neither of body ne of conscience in this
world / wherefore hit appears that the death were more couenable to the
doubtuous and suspicions than the life / For better it were to them for to deye
than to live long in such pain and myserye / But when thou art Just /
lawful / and of good life / thou ought not to doubt neither old nor young /
pouer ne rich / ne noble ne vylayne / neither death nor life / but thou ought
to live having no doubt / but only of god / Seneque says in his book of the
remedies of fortune that dread or fere comes to the man and says to him /
Thou shall deye / Surete answered and says / Death is to man thing natural and
not pain / by cause he is come in to this world for to deye and to return in
to the other world from whens he comes / For the life of this world nys none
other / but a pylgremage / For when the man has gone enough fro one side to
another / He must rotorne there wheroute he came first / Item fere says / thou
shall deye / And surete ansuereth / if I deye / I shall not be the first / ne
the last / For many one deyde before me / And all tho that shall come after
me shall deye also / For this rewle is generalle without any excepcion Item as
soon deyeth young as old / Item fere says / Men sayen euylle of the / Surete
ansuereth / if I were gylty / I should be ferefulle / specially / if hit were
said in Judgment And that men might prouue in Judgment that hit were as they
sayen of me /

Cum seruos fueris proprios mercatus in vsus Et famulos dicas homines tamen
esse memento
THou ought to traicte and to hold thine own servants swetly / the Which
thou have chosen for to do for the seruyse / For though that they be servants
/ thou ought to have in thy mind that they ben men as thou art / For thou
ought to know / that at the beginning of this world nature and fraunchyse
were both like and egalle to all men / Therefore says Seneque / He that is now
lord and great master / the time shall mow come by fortune that he shall
become a servant / by cause that the honors and fortunes of this world are
soon turned / therefore none ought to have trust in them / Item Seneque
says / that thou ought to live with thy servants and to repute and hold
them for thy friends and thy servants / For how be hit that they be
servants / Nevertheless they be men as thou art / It is said comynly that
there is no little friend / nor none lytelle enemy / It is read of a man which
had three friends / And the first he loved more than he did his own self The
second he louyd as much as he did him self / And the thyrdde he louyd less
than he did him self / It happed that this man had great need of his friends
and for to have help and socours he yede toward his first Friend / which he
loved more than his own self / to whom he exposed his caas and need / and
said to him / Ye wot well / that I love you more than I do mine own person / I
require and pray you / that ye will now help me at my great need / The which
answered to him / Man I wot not well what thou art / I have many other friends
which most be festyed of me this day / Nevertheless said he / here ben two
shetes for to couere the / which I give to the / Then the good man as al
concluded yede toward the second friend / which he loved as much as his own
self / to whom he exposed his caas as he did to the first friend and demaun^^ed
of him comfort and help / The which answered to him in this manner / Fair
and sweet friend / I have now other thing for to do / than for to help the /
ne for to counceylle the of thy faytte / but nevertheless I shall hold the
company unto the yate / And after I shall return to my hows / for to do and
go about my business / Then the good man woeful / and as desperate went
toward his thyrdde friend / which he loved less than him self / to whom he
exposed and told his need as he had done to the other two before said / saying
/ Allas I have no mouth / that ought to speak to the / For I have not loved
the so much as I should have done / but nevertheless I require and pray the
that thou ne wylt faylle me now at my need / For I am relynqued and forsaken of
al my friends sauf of the / The whi^^che thyrdde friend answered to him ioyously
and said / Certainly I hold and repute the for my lauful friend / For I shall
gladly go with the for to speak with the king / and shall pray him for the /
and for thy faytte / to the end that he condemn the not and delyuere the in to
the hands of thyn enemies / Moraly to speak / By the first friend thou
ought to understand the rychesses of this world / the which men love more
than their own self / but when they be cyted before the king / that is to
wete / before god of paradys / they bear with them of all their rychesses /
but only two little shetes / By the second friend thou must understand thy wife /
thy Children and thyn other parents / for as soon as they have accompanied
their fader unto the yate / that is to wete unto his grave / and that he is
buried in the earth / soon after they return to their howses for to go about
their business / and for to depart and dele their faders goods / which is
deed / By the third friend thou ought to vnd^^rstand^^ feythe / hope /
charity / almesses / and all good deeds which one has done in his life / the
which gone before us / when we are cyted before the king of paradys for to
keep and deffende us fro our enemies / that is to wete from the pains of hell
/ when the soul sh^^lle depart out of our bodies / By this Hystorye
appyeret^^ clere^^ / that he which is true friend / loves ever as well in
time of aduersytees as of prosperyte / And how we bear nothing out of this
world / sauf only (...) and ^^uylle de^^s that we did during our ly^^ / (...)
^^how and look for to do ever well / and treat thy ^^^uauntes / like as thou
would be treated of them / if thou were in such caas as they be / For how be
it that by cause of fortune sum be servants and in seruytude / Nevertheless
we are all brethren in Ihesu Christ / And they be men as thy self art /

Quam primum capienda tibi est occasio prima Ne rursus queras que iam
neglexeris ante
^^Hou oughtese to take the first and good auentures that happen and comen to
the / that is to wete the first good fortunes that thou know to the
profitable and necessary / to the end that afterward thou ne demaundest nor
ask not that which thou myghtest have had without any request nor demand /
and without danger / therefore says the proverb that one ought not to set
and put at his feet that which he holds in his hands / That is to wete
that the thing which thou may have the day which is vtyle and profitable
to the / thou ought not tabyde unto the next day for to take hit / For by
adventure that which thou may have to day without danger / if thou abydest
unto the next day / thou shalt not have hit at thy playsyre and without
danger / wherefore it ensieweth that none ought to be slouful and neclygent for
to labor and work for his body and for his soul both when it is time /
For thou must do as the Ante does / which makes his purueaunce in the somer
for to ly^^e in time to ^^ome in the winter /

Morte repentina noli gaudere malorum Felices obeunt quorum sine crimine vita
est
THou ought not to have joy of the sudden death of euylle folk / that is
to we^^e of the pour sinners / but ought to have thereof displaysyr and woe /
For hit befalls often / that as well the good folk as the euylle and wicked
folk deyen suddenly / For the Judgment and sentences of Ihesu Christ ben
dyuerses / Therefore well happy are they / which deyen in the feythe of Ihesu
Christ our redemptour / There ben five causes / why men ought to have
dysplaysyre and woe for the death of wicked folk / The first is by cause that
they be perpetuelly dampened / if they deye in sin mortal or dedely / The
second is for the great shame / that they take of their death before all the
world / The third cause that they be pryued fro the vysyon of god their
creator / The fourth is / the cruel pain and passion that they suffren at
their d^^th / The fyfthe is for the horrible image or figure that they (...)
after their death / For they be like unto that horrible bees^^ of the which
speaks thapocalips in the fourtenth chapter /

For five causes pryncipall men oughten to have joy of the death of the good
and Just folk / the first is by cause / that after the death corporalle they
regnen and comen in to the glori^^ of paradys / the second is by cause that
they have fayrer howses and gretter place for to dwell in / the third is by
cause / that they have better metes for to ete / the fourth is by cause / that
they have g^^etter light for to see / the fyfthe is / by cause / that they have
more better air for to smelle / These five goods acqueren the Just and good
folk after their death / when they be in the glory of paradys

Cum coniunx tibi sit / nec res and fama laborat Vitandum ducas inimicum nomen
amici
THou ought to flee and eschew all hate and melancolye of thy wife / that is
to say when thou have a fair wife / And that thou have not well / wherewith to
sustain her estate / ner wherewith to govern her / keep and ^^ke well / that
none deceive the / for often many one shall make semblaunt to be thy good friend
for love of thy wife / though that they be thyn enemies / And they shall find
the manner for to give euylle praysynge to thy wife and to take her worship fro
her / therefore thou ought for to repute and hold such folk for traitors /
and not to give to them the name to be thy friends / For enymytee and hat^^ are
contrary to friendship and concord / And if by adventure hit happed that men
spoke euylle by thy wife and of thy friend / and that hit were not so / And thou
ne supposest ne bileuest in thy conscience that hit he so / though that
oueralle be renommee that it is so / thou ought for to add gretter feythe
to the truth of this that thou know / than to the renommee that is given
to thy wife or to thy friend / For hit happeth oftymes / that the folk blamen
and speken euylle by sum persons which thing is not true / and sometime
hit is truth / And thus both the one and the other of the causes before may
befallen and be true /

Cum tibi contingerit studio cognoscere multa Fac discas multa vita nesare
doceri
^Hou ought not to be proud for thy great conning and science / that is to
wete / if hit happed / that thou have learned by thy dylygence and to have well
studied many of arts and scyences / thou ought not for to be the more
proud thereof / Ne yet to cesse of learning / ne for to have shame for to be
taught / and to learn of him which is less than thy self art / For thou
ought to suppose that thou woste little to the regard of other / For there is
none so wise a man / but that he fyndeth yet sum for to learn / Therefore says
the proverb that one may not al know / nor one may not have all / For none is
parfyghte in no science /

Miraris verbis nudis me scribere versus Hec breuitas sensus fecit coniungere
binos
THou ought not to be merueylled if this little book conteyneth two
sentences in two verses / For that have I do pryncipally for two causes / First
for to eschew prolyxyte / and long words / For if I had written many verses /
the sentence had be so great / so derke and obscure / that uneath my wit had
mow comprehend conceive / ne expowne hit / And therefore I have made this
little book in double verses / the which conteynen two short and vtyle
sentences for the simple folk / Also by cause that this day many one ben glad
to see or here short words or sentences / The second cause why I have done
and made this little book in two verses is by cause that the doctrine and
government both of the body and of the soul is contained in hit / For which
thing men may intytule this little book the myrour of the regyme and
government of the body and of the soul /

Here fynyssheth this present book which is said or called Cathon translated
out of Frensshe in to English by William Caxton in thabbay of Westmynstre

Rychard the third the xxiij day of decembre
