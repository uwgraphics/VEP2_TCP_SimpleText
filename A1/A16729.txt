THE ARBOR OF amorous Devises.

Wherein, young Gentlemen may read many pleasant fancies, and fine devises: And
thereon, meditate diverse sweet Conceits, to court the love of fair Ladies
and Gentlewomen By N. B. Gent.

Imprinted at London by Richard Iohnes, dwelling at the sign of the Rose and
Crown, near Saint Andrews Church in Holborne. 1597.

To the Gentlemen Readers: he^lth, wealth* and welfa^e.
R^ght courteous Gentlemen, your absence, this long time of vacation hindered my
poor Press from publish^^g any pleasing Pamphlet, to recreate your minds, as
it was wont: ^et now, to give you notice that your old Printer forgetteh not
his best friends, he has thought i^ meet to remember his duetifull good will
he bears to you all, publishing this pleasant Arbor ^or Gentlemen, being
many men's works excellent Poets, and most, not the meanest in estate and
degree: and had not the Phoenix prevented me of some the best stuff she
furnished her nest with of late: this Arbor had hi^ somewhat the mote handsomer
trimmed up, beside a larger scope for gentlemen to recreate them selves. Please
it you (sweet Gentlemen) to take it in worth as it is, though nothing
comparable with your pleasant Arbors of the country: view it over I pray you,
and praise it as you find it: in the mean time ( I beseech you) pardon me* and
p^otect me against cau^lling Find faults that never like of any thing, but
what they do themse^ues, and that, ^or the most part, is nothing at all: so
shall I acknowledge my self most bounden unto your flourishing d^gr^^, and
pray unto God to keep you al^ in health: and such (...) are in the country,
God send them a happy and speedy re^^rn^ to Lond^^, to the pleasure of God,
their h^rts content, and to the rejoicing of all Citti^ins, and specially to
the comfort of all poor men of Trades.

Yours, most bounden, R. I. Printer.

A LOVERS FARWELL To his Love and joy.
AD^e mine only joy whose absence breeds my smart,
whose parting did a^aze my mind and damped much my heart*
Adue mine only love, whose love is li^e to m^*
whose love once lost* no life can taste within my corpse to be.
Adue mine only friend whose friendship cannot fade,
whose faith is firm upon the which my health and hope is stayed,
Adue the vital spirits o^ these my ^ences all,
for dead each part will still remain until I hear thee call.
Farewell my self and all, farewell more dear then li^e:
Farewell the constant da^e on earth: farewell Ulysses wise.
Since spite ha^h playde his part, to part us now in twain,
my help ^h^l rest in h^ppy hope, till we two meet ag^ine:
Which hope does he^^e my heart above the hauty heaven*
and carries m^ with good s^ccesse a^oue the Plannets ^eo^en.
Si^h that the Sun m^st lodge within the Ocean seas.
As oftime as the hours be with in four co^^leat day:
So must Danaes face be rownd and horned thrice
and for her light a debtor be unto Sir P^ebus wise:
Before I shall enjoy the presence of my choice,
till which time comes, I Will cloy the skies with plaint^ and bitter voice*
That Fortune now which frowns with all her fatal dames,
shall have for praise most piteo^s plaint^, and infamy for names:
Until the rhyme that she does turn her face again.
and give me her that may redress my grievous pinch ing pain:
God grant that none behold thy face and beauty brave,
thy comely co^ps and featured form and countenance so grave,
Thy hairs in tresses tied, thy veins so Azure blew,
thy Lilly with the rose in che^kes does show a gallant hew:
Thy eyes wi^h smiling babes, thy lips vermillion like.
thy dimple in thy chin so brave, thy teeth as Crystal white,
Thyneck so white and fairt, thy breast so ^ound and so^t,
thy fingers fine and body small which I embraste so often.
No pen can well describe* no^ wit can well declare,
thy feature, form and comelynes, thy beauty passing rare.
^pelles cease to paint, Pigmalion leave to grave,
Da^e Nature has despisd your works, and has made one more brave.
The graces all attend the Muses make request,
still for to wait upon my dear, and be at her behest:
Blush now you bashles dames that vaunt of beau^ie rare,
for let me see who dares come in, and with my dear compare*
No, no, you are all fled, you walk like owls by nigh^,
my dear so fair, that of the world she is the only ^ight:
Then farewell heart and joy till time has run her race*
farewell delight, welcome annoy, till that I see thy face.
Which will delig^t my heart, which will revive my mind
which will delight my senceles corpse, which joy none else can find,
Take here my speech last spent* until thy home return.
take here my heart, but leave the corpse which shall in torments burn*
My scalding sighs I Will send throughout the skies to thee,
my tears shall water still my couch, vn^ill thou be with me.
Finis.
A Lovers complaint.
THe restles race that I have run,
the peril and the pain
That I from time to time have past,
and daily do sustain,
Does make me deem that when I first
this light began to see,
The ^tarrie sky no planet had,
that happy was for me.
The fatal Sisters three, alas,
my file do twist awry,
And Fortune, she in frowning sort
from me does swiftly fli^:
Which makes my carking cares abound,
thus am I wrapped in woe,
But how to find relief, alas,
poor man I do not know.
When that Sir Phoebus decks the sky
with his fair fulgent light,
I wish alas to gain with tears
the dim and darkesome night*
And when that V^sp^r with her veil
exiles the glittering Sun,
I will again^ the dawning day
the night might ouer-run*
Thus neither day nor night can serve
to mitigate my grief,
But still I pine and live in woe,
and cannot find relief.
Such torments toss my senses sure
and ransack every vain,
That I do wish to end my care,
the grave I might obtain.
The cause that coucheth care, alas,
with in my secret breast.
Is fell Cupid^es dreadful wound.
chief cause of mine unrest:
My suits, my plaints and friendline^.
is guarded with d sdaine:
And woefully whith Iphis I
must pass my days in pain.
I live and love, I serve in hope,
yet day by day I die,
Yet does my love disdainefully
her friendship sure deny:
The want whereof in forrowing sort,
to mourn does me constrain,
Ye Gods above grant grace to me.
abate my carking pain.
And suffer Cupid God of love,
to d^aw his regent da^^e,
And piercing joys to wound my dear
that she may rue my smarte:
And salve my wound that now am pressed
to die in seas of woe*
You heavens, your helping aides I crave,
to me your favors show.
Finis.
A poem of a Maid forsaken.
AS late I lay within an Arbor sweet,
^he ay^e to take amongst the flowers fair:
I heard a Maid to mourn and sorely weep,
That thithe^ vsd to make her often repair.
Alas, poor wench, quoth she, drowned in despair*
What folly ^ond does breed me my unrest?
Will spitfull love increase continual care,
To work her wrath on me above the rest.
And will she still increase my sorrowing sighs,
With pinching pain of heart, with torments torn*
Are these rewards, or are they Cupids slights,
To kill the heart which is with sorrows worn?
Then witness bear, you woods and wastes about*
You craggie rocks, with hills and valleys low,
Recording birds, you beasts both strong and stout,
You fishes deaf, you waves that ebb and flow.
Here have in mind that love has slain a heart
As true as truth unto her froward friend,
Whose dying death shall show her faithful part,
What so my dear has always of me deemd.
The red breast then did seem to be the Clarke.
And shrouded her under the moss so green,
He calls the birds each one to sing a part:
A ^ight full st^ange and wo^thy to be seen,
The Lark* the Thrush and Nightingale,
The Linnets sweet, and eke the Turtles true,
The chattering Pie, the lay, and eke the Quail,
The Thrustle-Cock that was so black of hew.
All these did sing the praise of her true heart,
And mournd her death with doleful music sound:
Each one dug earth, and plied so their part,
Till that she was close closed under ground.
Finis.
The counsel of a friend to one in love.
CLime not too high, for fear thou catch a fall,
Seek not to build thy nest within the Sun,
Refrraine the thing which brings thee to thrall,
Least when too late thou findste thy self undone:
Cause thy desires to rest and sleep a space,
And let thy fancy take her resti^g place.
The Tiger f^erce cannot by ^orce be tamed,
The Eagle wild will not be brought to fist,
Nor women's minds at any time be framed,
To do ought more then what their fancies li^t:
Then cease thy pride* and let thy plumes down fall,
Least soaring still thou purchasts endless thrall.
Finis.
A Ladies complaint for the loss of her Love.
COme follow me you Nymphs,
Whose eyes are never dry,
Augment your wayling number now
With me poor Em^lie.
Give place ye to my plaintes,
Whose joys a^^ pincht with pain*
M^ love, alas through foul mish^p,
Most cruel death ha^h slain,
What wight can well, alas,
my sorrows no^ indite?
I wail and want my new desire
I lack my new delight,
Gush out my trickling tears,
Like mighty floods of rain,
My Knight ^las, through foul mishap
Most cruel death has ^laine*
Oh hap alas most hard,
Oh death why did thou so?
W^y could not I embrace my joy,
for me that bid ^uch woe?
False Fortunu out, alas,
Woe worth thy subtle tr^ine,
W^ereby my love through foul mishap,
Most cruel death has slain.
Rock me a sleep in woe,
You woeful Sisters three,
Oh cut you off my fatal thread,
Dispatch poor Emelie.
Why should I live, alas,
And linger thus in pain?
Farewell my life, since that my love
Most cruel death has slain.
Finis.
The lamentable complaint of a Lover.
ACcord your notes unto my woeful songs,
You chirping birds which hant the cloudy sky,
Cease off your flight* and come to hear my wrongs
Compeld by love* mixed with crue^^^^*
Leave off I say, and help me to lament
My woeful days, until my time be spent.
With sorrow great I pass a way the time*
The which too long I feel unto my pain,
Too childish is this fond conceit of mine*
That void of hope does helpelesse still remain*
Yet will I rest til time does fu^ther serve,
That A^ropos does me of life bereave.
But fie fond fool, I complain of disease,
And faultlesse Fortune I begin to blame,
Venus her self does seek me ^or to please,
In causing me to love so rare a dame:
But if (^aire Nymph) I might enjoy thy sight,
Thy favor fa^re would force in me delight.
But I am bannisht from thy comely hew,
Oh thy sweet love, but yet I will remain
For ever thine as perfect lover true,
Without all guile, although thou me disdain:
And th^s I end, although not rest content,
Until such time wy wretched days are spent*
Finis.
A Poem both pithie and pleasant.
IF right were rackt and overrun,
And power take part wi^h open wrong*
If force by fear do yield too soon,
The lack is like to last too long:
If God ^ot goods shall be vnplac^d*
If right for riches leaves his shape,
If world for wisdom be embraced,
The guess is great much hur^ may hap
Among good things I prove and find*
The quiet life does most abound,
And sure to the contented mi^d,
There is no tiches may be found*
Riches does hate to be content,
Rule is enmie to quiet ease,
Power for the most part is impatient
And seldom likes to llue in peace,
I heard a Shepherd once compare,
That q^iet nig^^s he had m^re sleep,
And ha^ more m^rrie days to spare,
Then he which ought his Flock of sheep.
I would not have it thought hereby,
The Dolphin swim I mean to teach,
N^ yet to learn the Faulcon fly,
I roue not ^o far past my reach*
But as my part above the rest,
Is well to wish and good to will:
So till the breath does fail my bsest,
I shall not stay to wish you still.
A Poem.
THe time was once that I have li^ed free,
And wandered here* and where me likes best,
But in my wandering I did chance to see
A Damsel fair which causd in me small rest:
For at her sight mine he^rt was wounded sore,
That lived free and void of love before
Which when I felt, I got me to my bed,
Thinking to rest my heavy heart: but then
There came strange thoughts in^o my troubled head,
Which made me think upon my thoughts a gen:
And thus in thinking on my thoughts did sleep*
And dreamed that another di^ her keep.
With this same dream I sudainly awoke,
And orderly did mark it every point:
And with the same so great a grief I took,
That as one scard, I quaked every joint:
Yet at the last supposd it but a dream,
My troubled spirits did revive again.
Finis.
Fantasma.
IN fortune as I lay, my fortune was to find
Such fancies as my careful thought, had brought into my mind,
And when each one was gone to rest, full soft in bed to lie,
I would have slept, but then the watch did follow still mine eye:
And suddenly I saw a sea of sorrows pressed,
Whose wicked waves of sharp repulse brought me vnquie^ rest.
I saw this world, and how it went, each state in his degree,
And that from wealth granted is both life and liber^ie:
I saw how Envy it did reign, and bare the greatest price,
Yet greater poison is not found within the Cockatrice:
I also saw how that disdain, of^ times to forge my woe,
Gave me the cup of bit^er sweet, to pledge my mortal foe*
I also saw ho^ that deceit, to rest no place could find,
But sti^l constraind an endless pain, to follow natures kind.
I also saw most strange, how Nature did forsake
the blood that in her womb was wrought, as does the loathed snake*
I s^w how fancy would remain, no longer then ^er lust,
And as the wind how she does ch^nge, and is not for to trust:
I saw how stedfastnes did fly, with wings of often change,
A bird, b^t truly seldom seen, her nature is so strange:
I saw how pleasant Time did pass, as Flowers in the Mead,
To day that rises r^d as Rose, to morrow lies dead.
I saw my time how it did run, as sand out of the Glass,
Even as each hour appointed is, from tide ^o tide to pass:
I saw the years that I had spent, and loss of all my gain,
And how the sport of youthful playe^, my folly did retain*
I saw how that the little Ant in Summer still does run,
To se^ke her food, whereby to live in winter for to come:
I saw eke virtue, how she sat the thread of life to spinne,
Which shows the end of every thing before it does begin*
And when al these I saw, with many more perdie,
In me my thoughts each one had wrought a perfect property*
And then I said unto my self, a Lesson this shall be,
For other that shall after come, for to beware by me*
Thus all the night I did devise which way I might constrain.
To form a plot that wit might work the branches in my brain.
Finis.
The complaint af one being in love.
Leave me O life, the prison of my mind,
Since naught but death can take away my love*
For she which likes me well is most unkind,
And that which I love best my death does prove.
Love in her eyes my hopes again revive,
Hopes in my thoughts do kindle my desires,
Desire enflamed through love and b^auty strive,
Ti^ she (displeasd with lou^) my death conspires:
That love for me, and I ^or Love do call,
Yet she denies because she graunts not al.
Finis.
A Lovers resolution.
TRue, though untried, de^irous in despair,
Patient with pain, faithful though yet not sound,
In car^s unknown my youthful days I wear,
More s^re t^en safe my youth and beauty bound.
What shall I say? the time serves not to wail*
Let it suffice, my faith shall never fail.
Finis*
A Lovers complain^.
THE fir^ to see my wrongs for anger bur^eth*
(...) air in ^aine for mine ^ffec^ion weepeth,
The sea to ebb for grief his f^^wi^g turns,
The earth with pity dull the center keeps,
Fame is with wonder blazed,
(...) a way for so^^ow,
Place stan^eth still amazed,
To see my n^ght^ of evil which have no morrow.
Alas, only she no pity takes
To see my mis^rie^, but chaste and cruel,
My fall her glory mak^^h,
Ye^ ^^ll her eyes gives to my flames their fuel.
Fire burn me quick, till sense of burning leave,
Ay^e let me draw my breath no more in anguish,
Sea drown me in thee, of teadious life bereave me,
Earth take this earth, wherein these spirits languish:
Fam^ sa^ I was not borne,
Time d^aw my dismal hour,
Place see my grave vp-torne,
Fire, Air, sea* earth, Fame, time, place, show your power:
Alas, from all their helps I am exiled*
For hers am I, and death fears her displeasure:
Oh death thou art beguiled,
Though I be hers, she makes of me no treasure.
Finis.
A sweet lullabie.
COme little babe, come silly soul,
Thy fathers shame, thy mothers grief,
Borne as I dou^t to all our dole,
And to thy self unhappy chief:
Sing Lullabie and lap it warm,
Poor sou^e that thinks no cr^ature harm.
Thou little think and less do know,
The cause of this thy mothers moan,
Thou wantst the wit to wail her wo^,
And I my self am all alone:
Why do thou weep? why do thou wail?
And know not yet what thou do ayle*
Com^ little wretch, ah silly hear^,
Mine only joy what can I more?
If there be any wrong thy smart,
That may the destinies implor^*
It Was I, I say, against my will,
I wayle the time, but be thou still.
And do thou smile, oh thy sweet face,
Would God himsel^e he might thee see,
No do^bt thou would ^oone purchase (...)
I know right well for thee and me:
But come to mother babe and play,
For father false is fled away.
Sweet boy if it by fortune chance,
Thy father home again to send,
If death do strike me with his lance,
Yet may thou me to him commend:
If any ask thy mothers name,
Tell how by love she purchased blame*
Then will his gentle heart soon yield,
I know him of a noble mind.
Although a Lion in the field,
A Lamb in town thou shall him find:
Ask blessing babe, be not afraid,
His sugared words has me betrayde*
^hen may thou joy and be right glad,
Although in wo^ I seem to moan.
Thy father is no Rascal lad,
A noble youth of blood and boane:
His glancing looks if he once smile,
Right honest women may begui^e.
Come little boy and rock a sleep*
Sing lullabie and be thou still,
I that can do naught else but weep,
Will sit by thee and wail my fill:
God bless my babe and lullabie,
From this thy fathers quality.

A Trembling hand, but not a traitors hear^,
Writing for fear and fearing for to write,
Loath to reveal, yet willing to impart,
Such secret thoughts as ^it not every sigh^.
Must leave to you in sweet conceit to know ^he^,
For I have sworn that I will never show them.
I know not what, but sure the grief is green,
I know not when, but once it was not ever,
I know not how, but secretly unseen,
And make no care if it be ended never,
And yet a wound that wastes me all with woe,
And yet I would not that it were not so*
But oh sweet God, what do the^e humo^s move?
Alas, I fear, God shield it be not love.

A Lover in despair.
BVrne burn desi, e, while thy poor fuel lasts,
Young wood enflamed does yield the brauest fire,
Though long before in smothering heat it wastes
With froward will to conquer his desire:
But fire suppressed once breaking into flame,
Does rage till all be wasted in the same.
Most tyrannous and cruel element,
So to Envy the Substance of thy life,
As to consume thy vital nourishment,
Till death it self do end this mortal strife:
Yet work thy will on me O raging fire,
And lea^e no coals to kindle new desire.
Ne let the glowing heat of ashe^ left,
Yield to my fainting senses fresh relief,
But as my soul from comfort thou have re^t,
So end my life in this consuming griefet
For well I see, nor wit nor will now serves,
To recompense desire as he deserves.
Finis.
A Dream of the arra^gnement o^ Desir^.
A Court was lately kept in secret of conceit.
To call desire unto his death, or clear ^im of deceit,
^ayre Beauty was the Queen, and love was all her Laws,
Who had appointed per^em sense to sit upon the cause.
The wretches that accused desire of ill desert,
Where Envy, packt with Injury, to kill a careful heart*
The whole Inditemen read against desire, was this,
That where he most auowed best he meant not least amiss*
The Lawyers that did plead against this poor desire,
Where wicked wit with eloquence, whom hate and wrong did hire.
But to defend desire was plain simplicity,
Who knew the bounds and kept the bonds of perfect amity:
A grand Inquest in haste was panneld by the Court.
Of whom Tom-troth was foreman made* and so begun the sport.
Suspect did half affirm, that witness should not need,
And yet self-will would feign have sworn that al was true indeed.
But reason wild regard, the treason should be tried,
And deep conceit should be the man that should the truth decide.
Suspect in Natures sense laid shrewdly to his charge,
But care had brideled Natures course, love never lived at large,
And conscience plain replied in reasons secret thought,
That good wines need no Iuie-bush, and eloquence is naught.
^o sound the depth of all did senses all assemble,
And poor goodwill came swearing in, that love could not dissemble*
When patience fully heard the pleading of the case,
She called to reason to reveal who had deserud di^grace,
Good-wil was earnest still* and ^ware that live or die,
Suspect did sore abuse desire, for lovers could no^ lie.
With that the people laughed, and reason chargd Tom-troth
To give up unto perfect ^ence the verdict of his oath.
The Jurors were the thoughts that did posse the mind,
Where flattery was but fancies fool while faith did favor find*
Who when they had at full considered of the cause,
Gave Enui^ up for enemy to love and al his laws.
And wit was but a fool to follow false suspect,
And eloquence was little worth to carry such effect.
And hate and Envy both were had in great disgrace,
And eloquence for taking part, was hissed out of place.
And sweet desire was clear, in Reasons secret sense,
And perfect sense gave judgment so, and quit him of offense.
And beauty that before was thought did quite disdain him,
Did grant him favor by desert, and love did entertain him.
Suspect to silence put, good Nature g^n to smile,
To hear them judge to loves disdain that would desire beguile.
And sweet desire the force of enuies overthrow,
And therewithal the Court brake up, and I awaked so.
Finis.
Brittons Divinity.
FRom worldly cares and wanton loves conceit,
Begun in grief and ended in deceit:
I am coniur'd by hope of happy blis,
Where heavenly faith and highest favor is,
To call my wits and all my thoughts together,
To write of heaven, and of the highway thither.
The holy spirit of eternal power,
Vouchsafe his grace to guide my soul aright,
That patient heart may find the happy hour*
When I may see the glory of that sight,
That in conceit so fully may content me,
As naught on earth be able to torment me.
I ask no aid of any earthly muse,
Far be my fancy from such fond affect:
But in the heaven where highest Angels use,
To sing the sweet of faithful loves effect,
Among those spirits of especial grace,
I wish my soul might have a ^itting place.
Where first the tears of true repentant heart,
With faithful hope may happy favor move,
And sighing sobs of sorrowe^ bitter smart,
May see the life of undeserved love:
Thence would I crave some excellence divine*
To set my foot in this discourse of mine.
To judge of heaven it is a place of joy,
Where happy souls have their eternal rest,
Where sweet delights do suffer no annoy,
But all things good and only on the best.
Where comfotts moer then ^an can comprehend,
And such contents as never can have and*
It is the Throne ofhigh (...) sweet,
The God of power, of glory and of grace,
Where virtue dwe^s, and her adherents meet,
In joyful fear to see his heavenly face*
Where holy saints and highe^^ Angels sing*
An Alleluia to their heavenly King.
There is the day, and there is neue^ night,
There ever joy, and there is never sorrow,
There never wrong, bu^ there is ever right,
There eue^ have, and never need to borrow.
There ever* love, and there is never hate,
Never but there was ever such a state.
There all the graces do agree in one,
There lives brethren in one ^inke of love,
There all the saints do ferue one King alone,
Who gives the blis of highest hearts behoue.
There is the place of perfect paradise,
Where conscience lives and comfort never die^*
There is the Sun, the beauty of the sky,
The Moon and Stars, the candles of the night,
Th^re is the essence of that hea^enly eye,
That blinds the proud and gives the humble light,
There is the rain^bow bended by his hand,
Who does both heaven, earth, se^, and hell command
There sits God in glory of hi^ throne,
With Virgins, saints and Angels all attended,
Who in his ^re has Kingdoms overthrown,
And in his love has little things defended,
Whose glory more then may by man be known,
And glory most is in his mercy showen.
There does he sit in highest of his power,
Calling the poor unto his ^ich relief,
Sowing the sweet that kills every sower,
Giving the salve that heals every grief:
Makieg them live that long were dead before*
And living ^o, that they can die no more.
By him alone the dumb do speak ag^ine,
O^ him alone the blind receive their seeing,
With him alone is pleasure without pain,
In him alone have blessed hearts their being:
To him alone, and only but unto him,
All glory due that all the world may do hi^*
Now have I writ, though far beneath the worth,
Of highest H^auen, what happy heart conceiuet^
Now will I try in order to set forth,
Direction such ^s never hope deceives,
How care may climb the hill of happiness
Where is the heaven of highest blessedness.
Grace is the gro^^d of every good that is,
The ground once good, how can the work be ill*
Then that the mind may not be lead amiss,
Beseech the help of his most blessed will:
Whose only word ^^ts down the pa^^age be^^
Of humble souls ^o their de^i^ed ^est*
Begin to leave, and make an end to love,
Such wanton thoughts as woeful sorrow give,
Be once resolved and never do remove,
To live to die, as thou may die to li^^:
Which hell to hate, and seek for heavenly bli^
Read of the world, and tell me what it is.
The world (in ^rueth) is b^^ ^ wof^ll vale,
Where grief for grass, and si^nes do grow for feed,
Where substance, sense and s^ules are set to sale,
While hoorders heap that naked people need:
And for the gain but of a simple groat,
One man will seek to cut another throat*
What is the^e here that can con^ent the heart?
That knows content or what it does contain:
What thought so swee^ but brings as sower a smart?
What pleasure such but breeds a greater pain?
What thing so good but proves in fine so evil?
As (but for God) would bea^e men to the devil*
What is the earth? the labor of the life.
What is the sea? a gulf of grisly lakes.
Wh^t is the air? a stuff of filthy strife.
What is the fire? the spoil of that it takes.
Since these are al whence every thing does spring
What is the world, bu^ even a woeful thing?
What thing is man? a clod of mirie clay,
Slime of the earth, a slave to filthy sin,
Springs like a weed, and so does wear away,
Goes to the earth where first he did begin:
Think with thy self, when thou thy self art suc^
What is in man that man should be so much?
What has the world to lead thy mind to love?
In true effect, a fardle full of toys,
For wey the pith what every man does prove,
The perfect Gems are most imperfect joys:
Consider all what fancy brings forth,
The best conceit will fall out nothing worth.
What worldly things do follow fancy most?
Weal^h beauty love, fine diet, honor, fame
What finds aff^ct? both love and labor lost,
D^sdai^e* disease* dishonor, death and shame.
Where care and sorrow, death and dead^ie strife*
Do rule the roste in this accursed life*
What thing is beauty? a color pu^cklie gone.
And what is wealth when riches fall to rust?
What thing is love? a toy to think upon*
Fine diet, dross to feed a filthy lust:
What worldly honor often unworthy praise?
What ease, the cause whereby the life decays?
What is disdain? the scorn of proud conceit,
And what disease, the death of discontent?
Dishonor next the fruit of fond deceit.
And what is death? the end of ill intent.
Now what is shame? a shameful thing to tell*
What is the world but wickeds way to hell?
For beasts, for birds, for fishes, flowers and trees,
And all such things created for our use,
What thing is man to take such things as these,
By want of grace to turn unto abuse?
Oh wretched world, when man that should be best
In beastly things proou^s worse then all the rest.
Thus have I showed the world and wh^t is,
A wicked place and full of wretched woes,
A sincke of sin shut out from heavenly blis,
Where lack of grace does wit and r^ason loose:
So vile a thing as who in kind does prove it.
Will soon confess he has no cause to love it.
Now how to leave this loath some life of outs,
The h^tefull hell the ground of every grief,
Implore the help of those assured powers,
Who never fail the faithful soul relief:
Lay by these thoughts that are to be abhord,
And set thy heart upon the heavenly Lord.
First know thy God, and what a God he is*
Without beginning and can have no end,
Who in his love created only his,
And by his hand does eue^ his defend*
Whose glorious essence of his excellence,
Makes highest powers to tremble at his presence*
He made the world and what it does contain,
Only but man he made unto his love,
And man's good will was his desired gain,
Till proud attempt did high displeasure move*
He plagued his pride, yet when he saw his pain.
He gave the salve that heald the wound again.
He gave the rules to guide the soul aright,
What it should do, and what it should not do,
He showed the su^me of his desires delight,
And what the heart should set it self unto:
And in the good of his most gracious will*
He showed the good that healed every ill.
He gave the sun, the moon and stars a course,
That they observe according to his will:
He makes the tides to take their due recourse,
And sets the earth where it does settle stil^*
He made the substance of each element,
And sets his foot upon the firmament.
He gives us knowledge, and we will not know him
He bids us ask, and we will never move him:
He bids us come* and we are running from him:
He gives us life, and yet we never love him:
He is our King, and we do not respect him:
He is our God, and yet we do neglect him.
And naught but man that can o^ dare devise,
How to offend that holy will of his,
In only man that cursed humor lies,
That makes no care ^o run his course amiss,
But day by day does more and more offend him.
Whose only hand does from all hurt defend him*
Ungrateful man whom God did only make,
In love to love, and with his love preserves,
And for his love endured for his sake
Such death of life as dearest love deserves:
What cursed heart would in displeasure move him
That giving all, asks nothing but to love him.
Oh love, sweet love, oh high and heavenly love,
The only love that leads to happy life,
Oh love that lives for liui^g hearts behoue*
And makes an end of every hateful strife:
How happy he that kindly can attain it,
And how accursed that dare for to disdain it.
Love was the cause that first we were created,
Love is the life that we have given to lead,
Love is the cause we never can be hated,
Love is our life when other life is dead,
Love is ^he grace that highest good does give,
Learn but to love, and it is enough to live.
First love thy God that taught ^hee how to love,
Then love the love that he in love has taught thee.
That love so fixed as nothing can remove.
The hope of life that highest love has wroght thee
Thus if thou love, thy love will be a friend,
To gain the life where love will never end.
Finis.
A Lovers complaint.
TO love, alas, what may I call thy love,
Thy uncouth love, thy passions wondrous strange
A mischief deadly such as for to prove,
My heart would shun if power I had to change.
To change said I? recant again that sound,
Recant I must, recant it shall indeed.
Since in my heart ^o many things abound,
As yields desert how ere my fancies speed.
Sweet is the lewre that feeds my gazing eyes*
Sweeter the looks that whet me hot desire*
Sweet is the harbor where my quiet lies,*
But too unsweet the means for to aspire.
Yet must I love I love, and so I do,
Suppose it hard the thing whereat I retcht,
Who doubts but pearls are for the best to woe,
And greatest minds to highest actions stretch.
Be witness yet my friends of all my pain,
And powers divine that know my just complaint,
Let all my love within my bark remain,
Whom harmefull force has never power to taint.

A dialogue between Caron and Ama^o^.
A. COme Caron come with speed:

C. What haste? who calls me?

A. A woeful wight drowned in despair,
which now has need of thee.

C. Who craves my help wants hap:
But what afflicts the so?

A. My hope is turned to despair,
My friend become my foe.
Who vowed her self to me,
But perjured of her faith,
Performs not she promised,
As careless what she says,

C. Ah tyrant that she is:
But what do thou intend^*

A. That with one death ten thousand deaths
might have their final end.

C. Oh man for ferrie boat,
Go do what is assignd,
Despairing souls of Lovers faind
May here no passage find.

A. Oh Caron cruel wretch,
That thus have mocked me:
These hands of mine shall make a boat
To pass in spite of thee.
These eyes that stand with ^^ares
Shall make a flood to flow*
This heart shall stuff my sails with sighs,
And force my boat to go.

A Sonnet.
Give me leave to love thee less,
give me leave to love thee:
Thou see that I can do no less,
then give me leave to love thee.
THy golden hair, thy forehead fair,
Thy dainty brows, thy eyes so clear,
Those pretty dimplets to them near,
Do cause me thus to love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Thy comely cheeks like damask rose,
Y^mixt with Lillies I suppose,
Even parted by thy comely nose,
Would cause a man to love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Thy mouth from thence divided is,
By such proportion ofblis,
What treasure can be like to this,
that makes me thus to love thee?
Give me leave, etc.
Thine Amber breath, thy pretty chin,
Indimpled where it does begin,
Does make me think it were a sin,
If that I should not love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Thy Lilly neck, that pillar dear,
Like Alablaster white and clear,
Twixt upright shoulders does appear,
To make a man to love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Thy long smooth arm, thy silk soft hand,
I wish were to my neck a band-
So might I let thee understand,
how well that I do love thee.
Give me leave* etc.
Upon thy breasts more white then snow,
Two pretty pamplets euenly grow,
O^ venus gifts the richest show,
to make a man to love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Thy middle sm^ll, that curdie rock,
That there lies hid under thy smock,
Do move my spirits, I do not mock,
Exceedingly to love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Thy hidden parts I recommend,
To his conceit who is thy friend,
Whose labor sure does only tend,
in part and whole to love thee.
Give me leave* etc.
Thy brawned thigh, thy whirled knee,
Thy leg, thine anckle prettily,
Do give such comfort unto me
that I of force must love thee.
Give me leave* etc.
Thy heel, thy foot, thy toes so straight,
That trip and tread with such a slight,
Do with my senses all so freight
that needs I must thus love thee.
Give me leave, etc.
Each comely part from top to toe,
Will breed my silly heart much woe,
Unless it please thee for to show
that thou again wilt love me.
Give me leave, etc.
Then said my love, since that you say,
And do protest to love me aye.
My love to you I Will not denay,
in sort as you do love me.
Give me leave, etc.
So had I leave to love my Less,
So had I leave to love her,
Now should I be too much an Ass.
If I would not then prove her,
Give me leave etc.

A Poem.
MY Mistress all alone my service I did vow,
She swear, as she a woman was, no love she did allow.
Alas, then grew my pain, it greu d me to the heart,
My senses then so senseless were, as that I felt no smart.
And standing in a maz, as Aspis on the charm,
She said and swore (to save my life) she wished no good nor harm,
Alas, what bitter sweet, alas what pleasant pain.
What shiuering heat, what chilling cold, did pass through every vain^
And when I would have sworn her heart would never move,
By Jesus Christ she took that oath, that she did never love.
Alas what was I then? alas what am I now?
Too weak to love, too strong to die* quick, dead, I know not how.
Finis.
A Poem.
Wear happy I as others are,
Then might I live as others do:
But fortune gives a sundry share,
And more to one then others too,
The mind does yet content it self*
What ever fortune do befall,
And makes no count of cankred pelf,
Nor cares for any care at all.
For health it is the gift of God,
And give him thankts, and so have done,
And want of wealth a heavenly rod,
To punish natures eldest son.
Is friends do frown, then farewell they,
This worldly love will never last,
And if it be a rainie day,
The sun will shine when storm is past,
If troubles come a thwart thy mind,
Why it is a rule, there is no rest,
And he that seeks and cannot find,
Must take a little for a feast*
If Ladies love, then laugh for joy,
And if they do not, farewell love:
If thou be lost, it is but a toy,
And if it hold, it will not move.
Fair b^a^tie soon will fade a way.
And riches q^icklie fall to rust,
Thy youthful years will soon decay*
And age will soon give over lust.
The greatest horse is but a beast,
The highest H^wk is but a bird,
The sweetest b^nquet but a feast,
The brauest man is but his word.
To promise much does please the ear,
B^t to perform contents the heart.
And where performance comes, there
A vowed love can never part.
But they that have the world at will,
And shrinketh at a shower of rain,
May h^p to wish and want there will.
Unless their hands have greater gain,
But hap what will my heart is set*
I am resolved of this conceit,
If by desert I cannot get,
I loath to live upon deceit.
For stayed mind is of that state,
As every fortune cannot find,
For hope nor fear, nor love, nor hate,
Can ever change an honest mind.
^ut either die in secret grief,
Where care shall ever be conceald*
Then send abroad to seek relief,
And have a hurt unkindly heald.
And only trust in God on high,
For in the world there is no friend,
And loath to live and long to die,
And know the world shall have an end.
But if I die, and you do mis,
The sweet con^ention might command,
Then think but what a death it is*
To want d^sert without demand.
And think upon t^^ nights and days.
When beat^n brains and broken heart.
Did r^adie serve at al assayes,
For to discharge an honest part.
And if that you do hap to need,
As other men do now and than.
Think when that virtue stood in steed,
I. R. was a right honest man.
The time draws on* I hear the bell,
That calls for death my dearest friend,
But live or die I wish you well,
Though your unkindness were my end.
Finis.
A Poem upon this word truth*
IN truth is trust, distrust not then my truth,
Let virtue live, I ask no greater love,
Of such regard repentance not ensues,
And hope of heaven does highest power prove.
In truth sometime it was a sweet conceit,
To see how love and life did dwell together*
But now in truth there is so much deceit,
That truth in deed is gone I know not whither.
Yer lives truth, and has her secret love,
And love in truth deserves to be regarded,
And loves regard in reason does appear,
Approved truth can neuet be discharged:
Then try me first* and if that true you prove me,
In truth you wrong me if you do not love me.
Finis,
A Poem upon the word sweet.
SWeet is the life* that is the sweet of love,
^weet is the love, that is the sweet of life,
Sower the conceit that does unkindness move,
But kind the sweet that ends such a strife*
Then for the sweet of sweetest lovers vain,
Sweet if thou love me, sweetly come again.
Oh sweet and sweet, where nothing is but sweet,
Sweet be thy motions, and sweeter be thy mind,
Which shew^^ (...) sweet where sweet affections meet
In sweet content that cannot prove unkind:
Then sweetest heart that to this humor moouest me,
Sweet come again, that I may see thou love me.
Sweet I began, and so with sweet I end,
There is no sweet unto the sweet of love,
Nor love so sweet as in so sweet a friend,
Which shows the sweet no sowernesse can remove,
Let tha^ sweet thought unto this sweetness move thee,
Sweet come again, for by my sweet I love thee.
Finis.
A Lover finding ^is love unconstant, makes his lact farewell.
NO faith on earth, sweet fancy then adu^,
No fancy firm, why then there is no friend,
No friend but fained, what vice will then ensue,
Since trust does prove b^t treason in the end,
Farewell false love, thy trial is not just,
No faith on earth, there is no friend to trust.
Fancy farewell, which I have loved so,
And farewell love that makes me loath my life*
And life adue which bred me all my woe,
And farewell woe, the forger of all strife,
And spite adue, which breeds all contempt,
Contempt adue, whose mischief I repent.
And thus I end, repenting still my life,
Craving for death to make a speedy end,
To rid me soon from all this cursed strife
And ease my heart which sorrow still does rend:
With some contempt to shoulder off my pain,
Whose faith still stands in spite of all disdain.
Finis.
A Poem.
Love makes me loath my life,
Yet do I live by love.
This life brings death, and death brings life.
Both these and that I prove:
I sigh and sing for joy,
I laugh in pain to lie,
Thus moan works mirth, and mirth weaues woe*
Twixt both I live and die.
My color shows my care,
My care does work my pain.
My pain my grief, my grief my death,
My death mine endless gain,
In vain is beauties blaze.
If beauty want her meede.
The blossom fruit, the fruit his flower*
The flower will have his seed.
My youth does show my years,
My years should show my joy*
I haste to wed, I have no will,
I stoop, yet am I coy,
Though outward face does show
Mine inward heart not payn'd,
Yet does mine inward heart well know,
Mine outward face is fayn'd.
I fast, I pray, I play,
What diet can I prove?
But ah I see the ripest wits*
Are soonest thrall to love.
Since so it is, I sigh,
And to my self I sing,
Heygho, my heart* heigho* alas*
Love is a cruel thing.

The moan of a Lover in despair.
Go paper all be blurd* be blurd,
with bootles tears in vain*
Go tell, go tell the heavy news.
Of my consuming pain:
Go tell go tell unto my friends,
But if they a^ke thee why,
Let this suffice, it is enough,
I am re^ol^^d to die.
My head can take ^o q^iet rest,
Mine eyes recei^e no sig^ht*
My mouth no taste, my nose no s^ell,
Mine ears hear no delight,
My silly panting heart does faint:
but if they ask thee why
Let t^is suffice, it is enough,
I am resolved to die*
My feeble han^s withold their help,
m^ feet do let me fall,
My t^^gue ca^ harbor no delight*
to comfort me at all,
My wit and senses all do fail,
but if they ask thee why*
Let this suffice it is enough,
I am resolved to die.
I have bespoke the Clarck in haste,
to toll my passing knill,
I have in order as I ought,
my self set down my will:
I cannot long time here remain:
but if they ask thee why,
Let this suffice it is enough,
I am re^olu'd to die,
I have prepared my shrowding sheet,
my grave I have begun,
I have almost performed the race
my weary corpse must run*
I tarry but a little while,
but if they ask thee why,
Let this suffice it is enough,
I am resolved to die.

A Poem.
A Lively face and piercing beaut^y bright*
Aath linckt in love my s^^e senses all,
A comely port, a goodly sh^ped wight,
Has made me slide that never thought to fal^*
Her eyes, her grace, her deeds and manners mild
So strains my heart that love has me beguiled.
But not one dart of Cupid did me wound,
A hundred shafts light all on me at once,
As though dame kind a new devise had sound
To tear my flesh and crash a two my bones,
And yet I feel such joys in these my woes,
That as I die my spirit to pleasure goes.
These my fond fits such change in me does breed.
I have the day, and drive to darkness, lo,
Yet by the lamp of beauty I do feed,
In dimmest days, and darkest nights also:
Thus altring state and changing diet still,
I feel and know the force of Venus will.
The best I find is that I do tonfesse,
I love a dame whose beauty does excel,
But yet a toy does breed me my distress,
For that I dread she will not love me well:
Thus all my sweet still turn to bitter bale*
Ready to kill me ere I end my tale.
Oh Goddess mine* yet hear the voice of ruth,
And pity him that heart presents to thee.
And if thou will but witness for my truth,
Let sighs and groans my judge and record be,
Unto ^he end a day may come in haste,
To make me think I spend no time in waste*
For naught preuailes in love to serve and ^ue,
If full effect join not with words at need
What is desire or any fancies now,
More then that which is spread abroad indeed:
My words and deeds (...) in one agree,
To pleasure her whose sir^^a^e would I be*
Finis.
Of his Mistress love.
TTo try whose art and sttength did most excel
My Mistress, L^ue and fair Diana met,
The Ladier three forthwith to shooting fell,
And for the prize the richest Jewel set.
Sweet Love did both her bow and arrows gage,
Diana did her beauty rare lay down,
My Mistress pawnde her cruelty and rage,
And she that wanne had all for her renown:
It fell out thus when as the match was done.
My Mistress gat the beauty and the bow,
And straight to try the weapons she had won*
Upon me heart she did a shaft bestow.
By beauty bound, by Love and Vigor slain,
The loss is mine where hers was all the gain.
Of a discontented mind.
POets come all, and teach one take a pen,
Let all the heads that ever did indite,
Let Sorrow rise out of her darkest den,
And help an heart an heavy tale to write.
And if all these or any one can touch,
The smallest part of my tormenting pain:
Then will I think my grief is not so much,
But that in time it may be healde again.
But if no one come near the thought,
Of that I ^eele* and no man else can find,
Then let him say that dear his cunning bought,
There is no death to discontented mind.

WHat ailes mine eyes, or are my wits distaught,
Do I not see, or know not what I see,
No marueil though to see that wonder wrought,
Tha^ on the earth another cannot be.
What meant the Gods when first they did creat you,
To make a face to mock all other features,
Angels in heaven will surely deadly hate you,
To leave the world so full offoolish creatures.
Che^kes that enchaine the highest hearts in thrall,
Is it set down such fair shall never fade you.
Hands, that the hearts of highest thoughts appall,
Was not Minerua made when she had made you,
Fair: look on you, and farewell beauties grace,
Wise: why your wits the wisest does abash.
Sweet: where is sweet but in your sweetest face,
Rich: to your will all treasure is but trash.
Oh how these hands, are catching at those eyes,
To feed this heart that only lives upon them,
Ah, of these hands what humors do arise,
To blind these eyes that live by looking on them.
But heart must faint that must be going from you,
And eyes must weep that in you loose their seeing,
Heavens be your place, where Angels better know you*
And earth is too base for such a Goddess being.
Yet where you come a^ong those highest powers,
Crave pardon then for all these great offenses,
That when you dwelt among these hearts of ours,
Your only eyes did blind our wits and senses.
Now if you s^e my will abo^e my wit,
Think of the good that all your graces yield you:
A mazed Muse must have a madding fi^,
Who is but mad that ever has beheld you.

THose eyes that hold the hand of every heart,
That hand that ho^ds the heart of every eye,
That wit that goes beyond all Natures art*
The sense too deep for wisdom to discrie.
That eye, that hand, that wit, that heavenly sense,
Does show my only Mistress excellence.
Oh eyes that pearce into the purest heart,
Oh hands that hold the highest thoughts in thrall,
Oh wit that weyes the depth of all desar^,
Oh sense that show the secret sweet of all.
The heaven of heavens with heavenly power preserve thee.
Love but thy self, and give me leave to serve thee.
To serve, to live, to look upon those eyes,
To look, to live, to kiss that heavenly hand*
To sound that wit that does amaze the mind,
To know that sense, no sense can understand.
To understand that all the world may know,
Such wit, such sense, eyes, hands, there are no more.
A Pastorell of Phillis and Coridon.
ON a hill there grows a flovver,
Fair befall the dainty ^vveet:
By that flovver there is a bovver,
Where the heavenly Muses meet.
In that bovver there is a Chair,
Fringed all about with gold:
Where does sit the fairest fair,
That did ever eye behold.
It is Phillis fair and bright,
She that is the shepheatds joy:
She that venus did dispight,
And did blind her little boy.
This is she the wise, the rich,
And the world desires to see,
This is Ipsa quae the which,
There is none but only she.
Who would not this face admire,
Who would not this Saint adore,
Who would not this sight desire,
Though he thought to see no more:
Oh fair eyes yet let me see,
One good look, and I am gone,
Look on me for I am he,
Thy poor silly Corridon.
Thou that art the shepherds Queen,
Look upon thy silly swain:
By thy comfort have been seen,
Dead men brought to life again.
The complaint of a ^orsaken Lover.
Let me go seek some solitary place,
In craggie rocks where comfort is unknown:
Where I may sit and wail my heavy case,
And make the heavens acquainted with my moan,
Where only Echo with her hallow voice,
May ^ound the sorrow of my hidden sense:
And cruel chance the cross of sweetest choice,
Does breed the pain of this experience.
In mourning thoughts let me my mind attire,
And clad my care in weeds ofdeadlie woe:
And make disgrace the grave of my desire,
Which took his death wh ereby his life did grow,
And ere I die engraue upon my tomb,
Take heed of Love, for this is Lo^ers doom.

WHo takes a friend and trusts him not,

An Epitaph on the death of a noble Gentleman.
SOrrow come si^ thee down, and sigh and sob thy fill,
And let these bleeding bitter teare^, be witness of thine ill.
See, see, how Virtue si^s, what passions she does prove.
To think upon the loss o^ him, that was her dearest love.
Come Pall^^ careful Q^eene, let all thy Muses wait,
About the grave, where buried is, the grace of your conceit*
Poets lay down your pens, or if you needs will write,
Confess the only day of love has lost her dawning light*
And you that know the Court, ank what beseemes the place,
With grief engraue upon his tomb, he gave al Courts a grace*
And you that keep the fields, and know what valor is,
Say all too soon was seen in this untimely death of his.
Oh that he lived in earth, that could but half conceive,
The honor that his rarest heart was worthy ^o receive,
Whose wisdom far above the rule of Natures teach,
Whose works are extant to the world, that all the world may teach
Whose wit the wonder-stone, that did true wisdom tuch,
And such a sounder of conceit, as few or never such.
Whose virtue did exceed in Natures highest vain.
Whose life a ^anthorne of the love that surely lives again.
Whose friendship faith so fast, as nothing could remove him,
Whose honorable courtesy made all the world to love him
What Language but he spoke* what rule but he had read?
What thought so high? what sense so deep but he had in his head.
A Phoenix of the world, whom fame does thus commend,
Virtue is life, Val^r his love, and Honor was his end.

The Court al stricken in a dumpe, the Ladies weep and wail.
The Knights in careful sighs bewail their secret loss,
And he that best co^ceales his grief, bewraies he has a cross
Come Scholars bring your books, let reason have his right,
Do reverence unto the c^rse, in h^nour of the Knight.

Give him a volley o^ your hearts, that all the (...) may ^^are ye,
And ye that live at ^ome, and pass your time in p^^c^,
To help ye sing his ^ole^ull dirge, let sorrow never c^ase.
Oh could I mourn enough, that a^l the world may see,
The grief of love for such a l^sse, as greater c^nnot be.
Our Court has lost a f^^end, ou^ Country such a Knight,
As with the to^m^^t o^ the thought, has turned day to night,
A man, so rare a man, did never England breed,
^o excellent in every thing, that all men did exceed.
So full of all effects, that wit and sense may s^an
As in his heart did want no part to make a perfect man.
Perfection far above the rule of hum^ine sense*
Whose heart was only set on heaven, and had his honor thence
Whose ma^ke of hiest aim, was honor of the mind,
Who both ^t once did worldly ^ame, and heavenly favor find
Whom virtue so did love, and learning so adore,
As commendations of a man, was never man had more,
Whom wise men did admire, whom good men did affect.
Whom honest men did love and serve, and all men did re^pect.
Whose care his Countri^s love, whose love his Countries care,
Whose careful love considered well, his Country could not spare
Oh Christ what ruth^ull cries about the world do ring,
And to behold the hea^ie sighs it is a hellish thing.
The camp, the doleful camp* comes home with all a Mort,
To see the Captain of their ^are, come home in such a sort*
The Court, the solemn^ C^u^t, is in a sudden trance,
And what is ^e but is amazde to hear of this mischance,
The City shak^s (...) head, as it had lost a pillar,
And kind affect is in such care, a little more would kill her,
(...) Oxford sits and we^pes, and Cambridge cries outright.
To loose the honor o^ their love, and love of their delight.
The Clergy singing Psalms, with tears beblot their book,
And all the scholars follow on, with sad and heavy looks.
The Muses and the Nymphs attired all in black,
With tea^ing ^eares and wringing hands, as if their hearts would crack.
The father, wife and friends, and servants in degrees,
(...) blubbred eyes bewail the life that faithful love did leese.
My self that loved him more, then he that knew him much,
VVil leave the honor ofhis worth, for better wits to tutch:
And said but what I think, and that a number know,
He was a Phoenix of a man* I fear there are no more.
To set him down in praise with men of passed fame,
Let this suffice who more deserved: I never read his name.
For this he was in right, in brief to show his praise,
For Virtue, Learning, Valor, Wit, the honor of our days*
And so with honor end, let all the world go seek,
So young a man so rare a man, the world has not the like.
Whose only corpse consumes, whose Virtue never dies,
Whose sweetest soul enioyes the sweet ofhighest Paradise.
The sum of the former in four lines.
GRace, Virtue, Valor, Wit, Experience, Learning, Love,
Art, Reason, Time, Conceit, Devise, Discretion, Truth*
All these in one, and but one only prove,
Sorrow in age, to see the end of youth,
In the praise of his Mistress.
POets lay down your pens, let fancy leave to feign,
Bid all the Muses go to bed, or get a better vain.
There musicks are to base, to sound that sweet consaite,
That on the wonder of the world, with wonder may awaite.
But if as yet v^knowne, there be some dainty Muse,
That can do more then all the rest, and will her cunning use*
Let her come whet her wits, to see what she can do,
To that the best that ever wrote, came never near unto,
For Venus was a toy* and only feigned fable,
And Cresed but a Chawcers ^east* and Helen but a babble.
My tale shall be of truth, that never treason taught,
My Mistress is the only svveet, that ever Nature wrought.
Whose eyes are like those stars that keep the highest skies,
Whose beauty like the burning Sun* that blinds the clearest eyes,
Whose hairs are like those beams, that hang about the Sun,
When in the morning forth he steps, before his course be run
And let me touch those lips, by love, by leave, or luck,
When sweet affect, by sweet aspect may yet some favor suck*
They are those little foldes, of Natures finest wit,
That she sat smoothing while she wrought* and will be smacking yet.
And for that purest red, with that most perfect white,
That makes those cheeks the sweetest chains, of lovers high delight.
What may be said but this, Behold the only feature,
That all the world that sees the face, may wonder at the creature
I will not stand to muse as many writers do.
^o seek our Natures finest stuff to like her lims unto.
Foe if thou were on earth that could in part compare:
With every part of every part, wherein her praises are:
Either for Natures gifts or Virtues sweetest grace:
I would confess a blinded heart, were in unhappy case.
But what does Nature* Sense, and Reason does approve,
She is the only saint on earth, whom God and man does lou^*
Let this in sum suffice for my poor Muse and me,
She is the Goddess of the earth, and there is none but she.
FINIS.
