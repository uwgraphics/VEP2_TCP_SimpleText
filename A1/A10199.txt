TO THE CHRISTIAN READER.
CHristian Reader, I here present unto thy view and censure, a rough and brief
discourse: whose subject, though it be but course and vile, consisting of
Effeminate, Proud, Lascivious, Exorbitant, and Fantastique Hairs, or Locks,
or Loue-lockes, (as they style them:) which every Barba^ may correct and
regulate: Yet the consequence of it may be great, and profitable in these
Degenerous, Unnatural, and Unmanly times: wherein as sundry of our Mannish,
Impudent, and inconstant Female sex, are Hermophradit^d, and transformed into
men; not only in their immodest, shameless, and audacious carriage, (which is
now the very manners and Courtship of the times;) but even in the 1 Cor
11.5.6.15.
unnatural Tonsure, and Odious, if not Whorish Cutting, and 1 Timothy 2.9. 1 Pet.
3.3.
Crisping of their Hair, their Natural veil, their Feminine glory, and the
very badge, and Character of their subjection both to God, and Man: so diverse
of our Masculine, and more noble race, Conuerter^^^ in muliebre^ toller a^tia^
viri, non vsum tantu^ atque naturam, sed etiam vultum, incessum, ha^itum, and
totu^ penit^^ quicquid aut in sexu est, aut in vsu viri: ade^ vers^ sunt in
diuersum omnia, vt cum viris nihil magis pudori esse opporteat, qua^ si
muliebre aliquid in se habere videantur: nunc nihil turpi^^ viri^ quibusda^
videtur, quam si ^^ aliquo viri viderentur. Saluian. De Gubernat. Dei^ l. 7. p.

are wholly degenerated and metamorphosed into women; not in Manners, Gestures,
Recreations, Diet, and Apparel only; but likewise in the Womanish, Sinful,
and Unmanly, Cr^sp^ig, Cu^ling, Frouncing, Powdring, and nourishing of their
Locks, and Hairie excrements, in which they place their corporal Excellency,
and chiefest Glory. Strange it is to see, and lamentable to consider, how far
our Nation is of late degenerated from what it was in former Ages: how far
their Lives, and their Professions differ. We all profess^ our selves t^ be
Heroical, Generous, and true-bred Englishmen, yea Zealous, downright, and
true-hearted Christians, desirous to conform our selves to Christ in every
thing: and yet we are Pu^e^ eos Nationis suae quod non German^ aut Galli sint
procreati, ita patriam capillo tranferunt^ Tertul. de cultu. ^aem. c. 4.
quite ashamed of our English Guise, and Tonsure, and by our Outlandish,
Womanish, and Unchristian Locks and Hair, disclaim our very Nation,
Country, and Religion too: Alas, may I not truly say of too to many, who
would be deemed not only Englishmen, but Devout, and faithful Christians:
that the Barber is their Chaplain: his Shop, their Chapel: the
Loo^ing-glasse, their Bible; and their Hair, and Locks, their Pro Deo quisque

God? that they bestow more cost, more thoughts, more time, and pains upon
their Hairie Locks, and B^shes, from day to day, then on their peerelesse^ and
immortal Souls? that they consult more seriously, and frequently with the
G^asse, and Comb, then with the Scriptures? that they confer more oft^n with
their Barbers, about their hairie Excrem^^ts; then with their Ministers, about
the means, and matter of their own Salvation? Are not most of our young
Nobiliti^^ and Ge^trie, yea, the Elder too, under the Barbers hand^ from day,
to day? Are they not in daily thraldom, and perpetual bond^ge to their
curling Irons, which are as so many chains, and fetters to their Heads, on
which they leave their Stamp, and Impresse? Good God, may I not truly say of
our Gentry, and Nation, as Sen^ca once did of his: Qu^d illo^ o^tiosos vocas,
quibus apud tonsorem multae horae transmittuntur, du^ decerpitur si quid
proxima nocte succreui^^ d^m de singulis capillis in consilium itur: du^ aut

virum t^nderet? Quomodo excandescunt si quid de i^^a sua decisum est, si qu^d
extra ordinem i^cu^t, nisi omnia in annulos suos reciderunt. Quis est istorum

That they are now so vain and idle, that they hold a Counsel about every
Hair, sometimes Combing it back, another time Frouncing, and spredding it
abroad: a third time Combing it all before: in which, if the Barber be any
thing remiss, they will grow exceeding angry, as if they were trimming of the
men themselves: do they not rage excessiuely, if any Hair be but cut to
short, if it lie not to their liking, and fall not readily into its rings, and
circles? Would they not rather have the Commonwealth disturbed, th^n their
Hair disordered? do they not sit all day between the Comb, and the Glass?
are they not more sollicitous of the neatenesse of their Hair, then of their
safety? and more desirous to be neat, and spruce, then Honest? Capillum

Is it not now held the accomplished Gallantrie of our youth, to Frizle their
Hair like Women: and to become Womanish, not only in exilitie of Voice,
tenderness of Body, leuitie of Apparel, wantonness of Pace, and Gesture, but
even in the very length, and Culture of their Locks, and Hair? Are not many
now of late degenerated into Virginians, Frenchmen, Ru^^ians, nay, Women, in
their Crisped-Lockes, and Hair? have they not violated the Gra^e, and A^^^ent
Cut, and decent Tonsure of their Ancestors; and broken the very Ordinance, See
1 Cor. 11^14. Ezech. 44.20. Reu. 9.8.
and Law of God, and Nature, by their Womanish, 1 Timothy 2.9. 1 Pet. ^.3. See Mr.
Byfields S^rmon on 1 Pet. 3^3.4.
Embroidered, Colored, False, excessive Hair, and Loue-Lockes? and shall they
yet profess themselves to be Englishmen; or Mortified, Humble, Chaste, and
pious Christians? What, did ever any of our English Ancestors; did ever any
Christians in former Ages; did ever any Saints of God, that we can hear, or
read of, wear a Lock? or Frizle, Powder, Frounce, Adorn, or Deck their
Hair? or wast their thoughts, and time, or lavish out so great expenses on
their Heads, their Hair, and Locks, as we do now? If not, then let us be as
well conceited of our selves, as may be, yet certainly, as long as these
newfangled Locks, and Badges of our inuirilitie, Adhuc in processu vitia

or more then Womanish, and unnatural Effeminacy, which still increase,
multiply, and remain upon us, we can neither truly challeng the name of
Englishmen, nor style of Christians. For, 1 Cor. 6.14.15.16. Iam. 4.4. 1 John
2.15.16.17.
what part or portion can they have in Christ, who wear the very Badge, and
Livery of the World? who complie themselves to the Guise, and Tonsure of the
Deboistest, Rudest, and most licentious Ruffians? or give themselves over to
the Vanities, Fashions, and Customs of the very scumme, and worst of Men? Is
this to be a Christian, to follow every Guise? to take up every newfangled,
Deboist, and Ruffianly fashion? to submit to every Vain, and Sinful humor of
the Times? to deny our Selves, and Lusts in nothing; and to go as far in
all external Emblems, or Symptoms of Vanity, Pride, Licentiousn^sse,
Effeminacy, and Profaneness, as any others: and to exceed even Turks, and
Pagans in them, who are not yet so Effeminate, Idle, Proud, and Vain as we?
Alas, what is all this, but to be professed Enemies, and Rebels, unto Christ?
to be Deuill-Saints, or Bondslaues to the World, the Flesh, and Satan? this is
not to be Christians, but Antichristians, Infidels, Pagans, if not monsters: He
that is a Christian indeed, is a man of another temper^ His Wisd 2.1^.
Life is not like other men's, and His ways are of another fashion, C^loss.

habitum pudicitiae competentem. Tertul. De Cultu. Faem. cap. 7.
He fashions not himself to the Customs, Cultur^^, Guise, and Vanities of the
World, which He has renounced in His Baptism: 1 Pet. 4 2.3.
He lives not to the will, or lusts of carnal Men: Rom 13.13.14.
neither makes He any provision for the Flesh to fulfill the Lusts thereof: all
His desire and labor, is to conform himself to Christ in every thing: 1 John
2.6.
to walk as Christ walked; live as He lived: and to 1 Pet. 1.15. and 2.21.
follow His words and footesteps, in all the passages, and turnings of His
life: His Life is heavenly, Phil. 3.10.

His Hair, and Habit, such as answ^res His profession, and do well become the
Gospel of Christ: 1 Cor. 10.32 33.
not giving any just offense, or scandal to the Godly, Col. 4.5.
nor any encouragement, or ill example to the Wicked: Nusquam Christia^^^ aliud

vulneretur. Tertul. De Cultu. Faem. cap. 7. Deus s^ fuerit in pectore,
cognoscetur and in capite Faeminarum. Tertul. De Velandis Virg. c. 14.
His very Head, and Habit, do, yea, will declare Hi^ m^eke, and gracious
Heart, and proclaim His Christianity unto others: How then can such approve
themselves to be true, and humble Christians in the sight of God, or Men: who
are the only Minions, Sycophants, and Humourers of the World; following it
close at every turn, and complying themselves so fully, and exactly to its
dissolute Fashions, and Lascivious guises: Ia^ religionis antiquae non solu^ un
tutem amisimus, sed nec specimen re^inemus: Ecce enim habitus noster qui
humilitatis solebat esse insigne, in signum gestatur superbiae. Bernard^ ad
Gul. Abb. Apol.
That they have not only lost the inward e^^icacie, life, and power; but even
the very superficies, and outside of Religion? What evidence can such produce,
to prove their interest, or title unto Christ, who have nothing ^lse to show,
or plead for it, but the V^^ habitu negant quod toto suggest^ profitentur.
Tertul. De veland. Virg. c. 11.
Counterpanes, and Indentures, or the Cultures, Pompes, and Vanities of the
World, which they have long since in w^rds at least, renounced in their
Baptism? What, will the b^re name of Christi^ns, or the slight, and cold
performance of some out-ward duties of Religion, convey you safe to Heaven? or
will such a cold profession of Religion save your Souls, which is so far
from changing the in-ward frame, and structure of your Hearts, that it has not
yet so much, as altered your Vain, and Sinful guises, and Attires^ nor
differenced you in out-ward appearance, from the most Graceless, Vain, and
Sensual persons that the World affords? Alas, if we look upon the outsides
of men, (...). 23.26. Elingua Philosophia vita content^ e^t, ipse habitus sonat
Si^ denique auditur Philosophus dum videtur, de occursu meo viti^ suffundo.
Tertul. de Pallio. cap. 8.
which would certainly be reformed, if all were right within:) what outward
difference can you find between^ many young Gentlemen, who profess Religion,
and the d^boist^st Ruffians? Video et inter matronas, atque prostibulas nullum
de habitu discrimen relictum. Tertul. Apolog. aduers. Gent.
between many Grave Religious Matrons, or Virgins, who pretend De^otion, and
our common Strumpets? between us Christians and the most Lascivious Pagans?
are they not all alike Vain, Effeminate, Proud, Fantastique, Prodigal,
Immodest, and Unchristian in their Attires, Fashions, Hair, Apparel, Gesture,
Behavior, Vanity, and Pride of Life? are they not all so Irregular, and
Monstrous in their antique Tonsures, and Disguises, that men can hardly,
distinguish Good, from Bad: Continent, from Incontinent: Gracious, from
Graceless: Believers, from Infidels? See Tertul. De Pallio: and de cultis
Faeminarum. Cypr. De Habit: Virginum. Ambros. De Virg. lib. 3. Hierom. Epist.

There was once a time, when as Christians were differenced from Pagans, and
Infid^ls, by the modesty, and meanness of their Apparel, and their abandoning
of those external Cultures, Ornaments, and Attires, which the unbelieving
Gentiles, and themselves before their true conversion, did admire: but alas,
these times are now so altered, and inuerted; that we may better know a
Christian, by these Characters, and Badges of Paganism, then a Pagan: For what
Idolatrous, or Heathen Nation is there in the world, so Proud, so Vain, so
Various, so Fantastique, Effeminate, Lascivious, o^ Unchristian in their
Apparel, Fashions, Hair, or Head-attires, as we English, who profess our
selves the prime of Christians? Do we not transcend, and far surpass the
Persians, Tartars, Indians, Turks, and all the Pagan Nations in the World, in
these? and may they not lay more claim to Christ, and Heaven in all these
respects, then we? Let Christians therefore who are now thus strangely carried
away, with the Stream, and Torrent of the Times, and the Vanities, Fashions,
Pompes, and Sinful guises of the World; Quid non inuertat consuetud^? quid non
assiduitate duretur? quid non vsui ce^at? quantis quod prae amaritudine prius
exhorrebant, vsui ipso male in dulce conuersum est? Primum tibi importabile
videbitur aliquid; processis temporis ^i assuescas iudicabis non adeo grave;
p^ulo post, nec senties: paulo post etiam delectabit. Ita paulatim in cordis
duritiam itur, and ex illa in auersionem: Bernard^ de Consid. lib. 1. cap. 2.
which their own Hearts, and Consciences condemned at the first, before they
were hardened, and enchanted by them, by degrees, and custom:) look well unto
their Souls, and to their interest, and right in Christ, in these
backe-sliding seasons; when many fall off from Religion by degrees, unto the
World, the Flesh, and Satan, whose snares, and grand 2 Pet. 2.11^19, 20.
pollutions they had, (at least in out-ward show:) escaped heretofore; for
fear their Evidence for Heaven, prove counterfeite at last: And if they
find, Psalm. 24.4.
their Hearts inclined, or lifted up to vaniti^, or their affections and
practice, biassed to these Effemi^ate guises, Locks, and Cultures of the
World: they have reason, and cause enough to fear, In hoc cognoscim^^ quod
seculum diligimus, quia praciosa vestiment^ ^mamu^. Qui seculum no^ diligit,
pr^c^^^sa vest^ment^^ non quaerit. Quando hom^ gaudet de pulchritudi^e
c^rporis, men's eiu^ elongatur ab amore Creatoris. Quanto amplius in corporis
compositione laetaemur, tanto magi^ ae superno amore disiungimur. Bernard. De
modo been viuendi. Sermo. 9.
that their Hearts are yet devoted to the world, and quite estranged from the
Lord: Ex cordis Thesauro sine dubio procedit, quicquid for as ap^aret vitiosum.
Vanum cor vanitatis notam ingerit corpori, and exterior superfluitas,
interioris vanitatis indicium est. Mollia indumenta animi molliciem indicant.
Non tanto curaretur corporis cultus, nisi prius fuisset neglect^ men's inculta
virtutibus. Bernard^ ad Gu^ielm. Abbatem. Apolog.
that all things are not yet sincere, and right within them, because their
outsides are so Vain, so Proud, Fantastique, and Unchristian: and that their
claim to Christ, is merely counterfeite, because his Graces, Stamp, and
Image shine not in them, but the Worlds alone. If therefore we desire to
assure our Souls, and Consciences in the sight of God, that we are true and
real Christians; that we have any share, or portion in Christ, or any
inheritance in the highest Heavens: Let us be sure now at last, James 1.27.
to keep our selves unspotted from the World: Galat. 5.24.
to crucify the flesh with the affections, and lusts thereof: 1 Peter 2.11.
to ab^taine from all these fleshly lusts, which war against our Souls:
Romans 1^.13.14.
to walk honestly as in the day: not in Chambering, and Wantonness; but
putting on the Lord Jesus Christ, and making no provision for the flesh, to
fulfill the lusts thereof: yea to cut, and cast off all those Loue-Lockes,
Paintings, Powdrings, Crispings, Curlings, Cultures, and Attires, Mundicies
corporis atque vesti^us, ^nimae immunditia: quibus signis animus ^ibid^^osus
ostenditur: and per ex^e^^orem hominem, interi^oris hominis v^tia

which b^wray the great Deformiti^s, ^ilth, L^sciu^ousnesse, Pride, and Vanity
of our So^^es, b^t are no luster to our bodi^s: that so we may ad^^ne the
Gospel of Christ, and beautify our Christian pro^essi^n, by an humble, lowly,
examplary, and corespondent conversation. And if these Fashions, Lock^s, and
Cultures s^^m^ such Niciti^s, Tr^fl^s, Toys, or nee^lesse scrupul^sities unto
any, as may admit an easy disp^nsation, and may be still retai^ed without any
h^rt, ^r danger to men's Souls, or scandal to Religion: I answer^; that if
they are not Sinful, and Unlawful in themselves, as they ar^ proved in this
present Treatise by the consent of all Antiquity: yet they are but See Calvin:
Comment. on Numbers 6. v. 5. Mayer Exposit: on 1 Pet. 3.4.
E^feminate, Ridicul^us, Vnpro^itable, and Foolish vanities, or Cultures of the
World, in their very best acception; which Christians should not dot^ upon,
since they have renounced them in their Baptism; and since they have far
greater things then these, on which to busy, and impl^y their thoughts and
time. Christians have their rich and precious Souls to beautify, Talis
misericordia crudelitate ple^a est, qua videlicet it a corpori seruitur vt
anima iuguletur. Qua enim charita^ est carnem diligere, and spiritum negligere?
Quaue discretio totum d^re corpori, and animae nihil? Qualis vero misericordia

which they unmercifully butcher, and neglect, whiles they are to c^rious, and
exa^t in the Culture of their bodies; they have a great, and holy God to serve
continually; they have sundry Heavenly graces to procure, cherish, and enlarge:
they have a multitude of Christian duties, and Heavenly ex^rcises to discharge
from day to day: they haue^ See Mr. Perkins T^eatise of Callings.
or should have callings, and sundry warrantable employments, both for their
own, and others good, and Gods own glory; all which will quite ingrosse their
time, Tamdi^ discendum est quem. adm^dum viuas, quandiu viu^^. Vi^ere tota vita

Seneca. Epist. 76. and De Breu. Vitae. cap 7.
their lives, and thoughts, and take them off from all these head-altiring
cares, in which too many wast, and spend their days: No reason therefore have
they to allow themselves in these bewitching, and time-deuouring Vanities,
which steal away their Hearts, and Lives from God, and better things. And why
should Christians take any liberty to themselves at all, in these nugatorie,
and Unchristian vanities? Is it not exceeding scandalous unto others, and
d^ngerous to themselves to do it? does it not Quam blasphemabile est, si quae
sacerdotes pudicitiae aicimur, impudicarum ritu procedatis cul^ae aut expictae
Tertul. de cultu. Faem. c. 7.
blaspheme, and scandalize Religion, and make it odious unto Pagans, who are
not half so Vain, so Proud, and Vicious in this kind as Christians? Men's
Deodicata sic caveat minora vitia vt ma^ora: quia a minimis incipiunt, qui in
maxim^ proruunt. Bernard. de Ordine vitae. Col. 112^. C.
and will it not draw all such, who take this liberty to themselves, to
greater, and more scandalous sins at last, to the wrecke, and hazard of their
Souls? Alas, such is the strange deceitfulness of our Hearts, and the inbred
prauitie of our Natures: that if we once Vanitas ad iniquitatem l^bitur, and
dum ex al^is ad ali^ semper impellitur, suborientibus culpis inquinatur. Ex
vanitate ergo, ad iniquitatem ducimur: cum prius per leuia delicta defleuimus,
vt vsu cuncta leuigante, ^equaquam post commit^ere etiam grauiora timeamus. Na^
dum moderari lingua otiosa verbae negligit, audax ad noxia prorumpit: dum gula
incumbitur, ad leuitatis protinus ins^niam proditur: cumque men's sub^gere
delectationem carnis renui^, plarumque and ad perfidiae voraginem ruit. Si enim
curare parua negligimus insensibiliter seducti, audenter etiam maior^
perpetramus: quia si vanitatis culpa nequaquam caute compescitur, ab iniquitate
protinus men's inca^ta deuoratur. Vanitatis quippe finis est, vt cum peccato
mentem sauciat, hanc ex culpa audacem reddat. Et sit plerunque vt prauis
d^sideriis seruiens, a ^ugo se diuini t^moris excutiat, and quasi in malorum
perpetratione iam libera, omne quod volupt^s suggerit, implere conte^dat. Greg.
Mag. Moral. l. 10. c. 13.14.15.
begin to play, and dandle with small and petty Vices, yea, though it be but
with Vanities, Toys, and idle Fashions: they will quickly draw us on to
scandalous, great, and heinous sins at last; and so fetter us in the ginnes,
and snares of gross impieties; that we shall sooner sincke down into Hell
under their weight, and pressure, then shake off their bondage. He that
begins to nourish, or reserve a Lock, or to adorn, set out, and Crispe his
Hair but now and then: though he were a Modest, Sober, Chaste, Industrious, or
somewhat Religious person at the first: if he once but slack the raines of
his affections to these vanities, and keep no stiff hand over them, to curb
them in due season; will soon degenerate into an Idle, Proud, Vaineglorious,
Unchaste, Deboist, and graceless Ruffian: His Amourous, Frizled, Womanish, and
Effeminate Hair, and Lock, will draw him on to Idleness, Pride, Effeminacy,
Wantonness, Sensuality, and Voluptuousness, by degrees; and from thence to
Incontinency, Whoredom, Deboistnesse, and all Prophannesse, to the eternal
wrecke and ruin of his Soul. This the woeful, and lamentable experi^nce of
thousands in our age can testify, who by giving way unto the outward Culture
of their Heads, and Bodies, and yielding but a little to the sinful Guises,
and Fashions of the Times at first: have been at last precipitated into the
very sink, and puddle of all dissoluteness, and uncleanness, to the
inextricable loss, and hazard, not only of their Bodies, Goods, Estates, and
Credits: but of their rich, and peerless Souls. O therefore let us look
unto our Hearts, and Souls betimes, let us keep, and fence them against the
very Principi^s obsta: sero medi^ina paratur, Cum mala per long^s inualuere
moras. Ovid. de Remed Amoris. l. 1.

so captiuate, and inthrall us; that we shall hardly disposses, or quite eiect

these Monstrous, Strange, Ridiculous, and misshapen Fashions, and Attires:
which transform our Heads, and bodies into a thousand Antique, and Outlandish
shapes? to disrobe our selves, of all our Proud, and costly Plumes, which bid
de^iance to the Lord of Hoasts, and cause him to vnsheath his glittering Sword
against us, to our final overthrow, and utter desolation? and to cut, and cast
off all those Locks, and Emblems of our Vanity, Pride, Incontinencie,
La^ciuiousnesse, and gross Effeminacy, which Prognosticate some eminent, and
fatal judgment to our Land, and Nation? and hasten to accomplish, and draw it
down upon us to the full? Has not the Lord begun to smite, and ruin us for
these sins already? Has he not sent a man-eating Pestilence, and
d^populating Plague among us, which has cut off thousands, week, by week:

other men's Vanity can invent? to live in the very ruff, and height of Pride,
and Vanity? or purposely to sell our selves: yea to educate, and train up our
children, (who should Ephesians 6.4.
be brought up in the fear, and nurture of the Lord: as the common custom of
our Nobility, and Gentry is;) to Wantonness, Idleness, Voluptuousness,
Epicurisme, and all excess of Sensuality, Pleasure, Vanity, Pride, and
carnal iolliti^; as if we took delight, and pleasure in our own
destruction; or meant wilfully to incur the very worst, and uttermost of Gods
heauiest Judgments? What, have we not ^ggreuated, and multiplied our
iniquities, and sins sufficiently already, but that we must thus intend, and
increase them more, and more? are we not yet deep enough in Gods displeasure,
that we thus pro^oke, and grieve him further every day? or do we think to
auocate, or divert Gods Judgments, or to move him to compassionate us, by
filling up the measure of our unmeasurable sins against him? or are we
willing, and desirous for to perish, or to bring our selves, and Country unto
speedy ruin, that we are now more vile, more Sinful, Proud, and desperately
wicked, Esaias ^.9.
proclaiming our Impudency, Vanity, Idleness, Hautinesse, and Sin, as
Sodom did, not laboring once to hide it, though we expect, yea feel Gods
Plagues, and Judgments on us every moment? Alas, (my brethren,) what do you
mean to do, or which ways will you turn your selves? will you wilfully cast
away Gods Love, and Favor: and subject your selves, to the very utmost of his
wrath, and vengeance? will you still provoke the Lord to your destruction, even
beyond recovery? will you subject us to the Spanish yoke, and bondage? to all
the miseries that Rome, that Spain, that Heaven, or Hell can plot against us?
If this be your intended resolution; go on, and take your fill of Sin, of
Pride, and Vanity: I will not interrupt you.

But if you would avoid, divert, and quite escape that ouerrunning flood, and
torrent of Gods Judgments, (which is like to sweep us all away, we cannot
tell how soon,) which our sins now call for, and our Hearts presage is near
at hand: if your desire to enjoy more Halcyon days of Peace, or years of
Jubilee, and full prosperity, which may make your lives a very Paradise, or
Heaven upon Earth. If you expect any further repriuall at the hands of God, or
if you would still retain his Presence, Face, and Favor; his Gospel, and

courses by which W^e have wilfully cast our Selves into those present
miseries, which We fear, or suffer, and which our Friends about us have

take warning by our former stripes? which Deus crudeli^^ vrit, Quos videt

(Christian Readers,) if you have any sense, or feeling of our present miseries:
any apprehention of our future dangers, under the very thoughts, and fear of
which We pine, and languish: any Bowels of compassion, to your Selves, your
Country, or Posterity: any care at all to Remove, Divert, or Anticipate
those heavy Judgments, which We fear, or suffer: or to reuerse that fatal
Curse of God, which cleaues to all our public Enterprises, and Designs: any
forwardness to regaine our Ancient Glory, Victories, and Renown abroad: or to
establish Unity, Safety, Peace, and welfare in our Church, or State at home:
or any Cordial, and strong Desire, to retain Gods Word, his Blessing, Face,
and Favor still among us, which now withdraw themselves apace, as if they had
no pleasure in us: Let us now, even now at last, after so many warnings, and
Repriualls: so many days of Grace, and Mercy, so many Mild, and Fatherly
Chastisements, in the midest of all Mag^is i^imicoru^ circu^damur agminibus:

We are almost senseless of them, perchance, beca^se God means for to
destroy us:) abandon all our Bravery, Pride, and Vanity; and all these
Cultures, Loue-Lockes, and Disguises, which blemish our Profession, and Arm
our God, and all our Enemies against us, to our just destruction: If We will
now lay down these weapons of Rebellion, which bid defiance to the Lord of
Hosts: if We will reform our Heads, and Hearts, Morbid^ en^m capite, nihil

which distemper all our other members, with the Flux of sin; and make them
all unsound: if We will yet humble our Souls before the Lord for all our
sins, and turn our Heads, our Hearts, our Hand^s, our Eyes, and Feet unto
his Testimonies, without any more d^layes: Zeph. 2.3. Ionah^ 3.8.9.10
it may be there is yet a day of Grace, a time of M^rcy, Peace, and Favor
reserved for us in the breast of God, and we may yet esc^pe those sad, and
fatal Judgments, which God now threatens, and we feel, or fear: But if we
still walk on, as in a progress, in the Effeminacy, Pride, and Vanity of our
Lives, or in the stubbornness of our hard, and graceless Hearts, from evil,
to worse, heaping up sin, to sin, without all stinte, or measure, Ad
mundana gaudia, and temporalia bona multitudo procliuis est. Et quamuis
incertum, caducumq, sit quod cupitur, libentius tamen suscipitur labor pro

as We do: Let other men expect, and hope what good they will; I for my own
part, can Prognosticke nothing, but our final ruin. For if we still go on
in sin, in despite of all Gods Judgments, or Qui beneficiis non

ouercomming F^uours: God will, he must, proceed in wrath, and vengeance: so
that Ier. 15.1.2. Ezech. 14.14.14.18.20. Luke 13.3.5. Leuit. 26. Deuteronomy. 28.
though Moses, Daniel, Noah, Samuel, Job, and Abraham, should stand before him
in the gappe, to divert his Indign^tion, Wrath, and Judgments from us, yet his
mind could not be toward us, but he will cast us out of his sight; and send
us out to Death, to Sword, to Famine, and Captivity without Redemption, till
we perish. O therefore hearken, and Repent betimes, that so iniquity may not
prove your ruin. And if you would be rescued from Gods Judgments,
(especially from that fatal, and deforming sickness of the Pox: which God
has now certainly sent upon us, but especially, upon our Gentry, who are
most visited, and af^licted with it, Isay 3.16.17.24.
as he did upon the hautie Daughters of Zion, for our excessive Pride, and
ouer-curious decking of our Faces, which steal away our Hearts, our Thoughts,
and Time from God, and better things:) or else indeared in his Favor: then
wash, your Heads, your Hands, and Ier. 4.14.
Hearts from all their Vanities, Pride, and Wickedness, that you may be saved:
Quid pr^desse poter^t Antidotum cui superfunditur venenum! Salu. de Gub^ Dei.

Antidotes will profit nothing, as long as they are besprinkled, with Poison:
all our Wishes, Tears, and Prayers, or the Supplications of others of Gods
dearest Children for us, cannot auail^ to help, to succor, or do us any good,
as long as they are empoysoned with our sins: Psalm. 66.18.
If we regard but any iniquity in our Hearts, (much more when we practice
nothing but Sin, and all excess of Pride, and Vanity in our lives,) the
Lord will not hear us: Isai. 1.15. and 50.3.4 Prou. 1.24. to 33.
yea, though we make many Prayers to him, and add Fasting to our Prayers, to
make them more available; yet, he will not regard, but quite reject us: Mal.
1.10.
his Soul shall have no pleasure in us. O turn you, turn you, therefore from
all the Sin, and Evil of your doings: from that abundance of Idleness, and
superfluity of Pride, and Vanity which has ouer^pred our Nation: from all
those Antique, Effeminate, Meretricii enim pilorum plexus and catenarum nexu^

Deforming, Strange, and Unchristian Attires, Fashions, and Disguises, which
transform us into sundry Monsters, and almost deprive us of our Natural, and
Humane s^apes: that so we may cloathe our selves with Jesus Christ, Serico and
purpura indutae Chris^u^ indu^re non possunt. Cypr. De Habitu. Virg.
Proiiciamus orname^ta terren^ si coelesti^ optaemus. Tertul. de Cultu. Faem. c.

who will never comply, nor suite with such Attires, or those who are devoted
to them. And if we will be Pranking, and Tricking up our selves, let us deuote
our Thoughts, our pains, and Time, to the inward Culture of our Immortal
Souls, which now lie quite neglected, whiles our Hairie excrements are so much
adored. These Souls of ours, which now we so much undervalue, as to prefer
the very vainest Vanities of the World before them; are the Spouse, and Love of
Christ: the very Palace, and Temple of the Sacred Trinity: the very Wealth,
and total Sum of all we have: O then, let us cloathe, and de^ke these Souls
of ours, with the robes of Jesus Christ his Righteousness: with Psalm. 45.13.14
the clothing of wrought Gold; the raiment of Needle-Worke; the transplendent
Jewels, and Pearls of Grace, and with the whole Wardrobe, and Cabinet of
Heaven; that so we may even ravish the very Heart of Christ, Cant. 2.5. and 5.8
and make him sick of Love: And if we will needs adorn our bodies too:
Prodite vos iaem medicamentis and ornamentis extructae Apostolorum, sumentes de
simplicitate candore^ de pudicitia ruborem; depictae oculos verecundia: etc.
Te^tul: De Cultu. Faem. c. 9. See Cypria^ de hab. Virg. Clem. Alex. Paedag. l.
2. cap. 22. l. 3. c. 11.
let us Paint our Faces with the candor of Simplicity, and Vermilian-blush of
Chastity: and our Eyes with Modesty: let Silence, or Holy conference, be the
ornament of our Lips; the Word of God our Earings, and the Yoke of Christ our
Necke-bracelets: Let us submit our Heads to Christ, and then they are
sufficiently, adorned: Let our hands be busied with the Distaffe, or some
other honest employment, of our general, or special callings: and our Feet
shod with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace: which makes them more rich,
and lovely, then if they were clad in Gold: Let us cloathe our selves with the
Silk of Honesty, the Laune of Sanctity, and the Purple of Chastity: Taliter
pigmentatae Deum habebitis amatorem: So shall our God be inamored with us, and
attoned toward us: so shall his Judgments be diuerted, his Favor regained,
his Mercies enlarged, his Gospel continued, our Foes subverted, our Church
reformed, our Kingdom established, our Grieuances redressed, our Fears
removed, our Peace prolonged, and our Souls eternally saved, Isay 2.11. to 18.
in that Great, and terrible Day of the Lord, wherein the lofty looks of Man
shall be humbled, and the hautinesse of Men shall be bowed down, and the
wrath of the Lord of Hosts, shall rest upon every Proud, and Lofty person, who
is high, and lifted up, to bring him low, that the Lord alone, may be exalted
in that day.

Now this Lord, and God of Blessing, Bless this poor Treatise, to the Soul^s
of many, which I have presumed for to publish, not out of any Singular, or
Nouellizing Spirit, (as some may chance to think; because it treates of such a
Subject; in which none else have ever traveled to my knowledge:) or out of any
Vainglorious humor of purchasing applause from others, or venting of my own
conceits: but out of a sincere, and true desire, of confining Englishmen, and
such as bear the name of Christians, to English, Non solum enim pudicos ac

and true Christian Fashions, and Attires: to stop the ou^r-flowing Sins, and
Monstrous vanities of these our Times, (which far exceed all former
Precedents; and find either none, or little public Opposition:) and so, as
much as in me lies, to turn away that black, and gloomie Cloud of Wrath,
and Vengeance, which now hangs houering over all our heads, threatening a
sudden Storm of Blood, of Misery, Ruin, and Desolation to us, unless, we
thoroughly, and speedily Repent: In which if I have erred in any particular, as
well I may, because I have walked in an untrodden p^th, and had no foote-steps
but mine own to follow, (though some are so Malicious to report abroad; that
my Works, they Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter hono^es, etc. Donatus in

THE VNLOVELINESSE, OF LOVE-LOCKES.
INfinite and many are the sinful, strange, and monstrous Vanities, which this
Unconstant, Vain, Fantastique, Idle, Proud, Effeminate, and wanton Age of
ours, has Hatched, and Produced in all the parts, and corners of the World;
but especially, in this our English climate; which like another Aphric^ semper

sundry Pagans, have Sentenced, and Branded; as a mere invention of the
Devil: as an Unnatural, Detestable, Heathenish, Proud, Lascivious, Whorish,
and Infernal practice, peculiar unto none but audacious Whores, and Stu^pets,
or persons desperately Wicked: as a Bait, a Snare, or mere allectiue to
Inescate, and Inamour others with us; as an Art that offers violence unto God
himself, in obliterating that Natural, and lively Image, Form, and Beauty,
which he has stamped on his Creatures: in Correcting, Changing, and Nullifying
of his Work; and so taxing him for an Imperfect, Bungling, or Unskillful
Workman: in preferring those artificial Faces, and Infernal varnishes, which
Satan has Portraitured, and set out to Sale; before that Natural, and comely
Countenance, Face, and Feature, which Gods own Curious, and neuer-erring
Finger has carved out unto us: in changing that into a Counterfeite, False,
and fained Picture, or a Rotten, painted Statue, which he has made, a Real,
Lively, Rational, and holy Creature: and as a Pernicious, and Soule-deuouring
Evil, which without Repentance, Dammes all such as use it, to the depthes of
Hell, from which there is n^ Redemption: and causes God to forget, yea, not to
know them here; and to disclaim, and utterly renounce them in the day of
Judgment: because they want that royal Image, and Superscription, which He
had stamped on them; which I would our Painted Iezabels, Dames, and Ladies
would consider, in a Deliberate, Cordial, and Soule-affecting manner, for
fear they feel the smart, and terror of it at the last: Not to insist (I
say) on these, or many such like sins and vanities of our female sex, which
would requi^e a large and ample volume to batter and confound them: I have
resolved for the present, to single out one sinful, shameful, and uncomely
vanity, with which to grapple; which has lately seized on many effeminate,
loose, licentiou^, singular, fantastique, and vainglorious perso^s^ of our
masculine, and more noble Sex: to wit, the nourishing and wearing of
unnatural, shameful, and unlovely Lock^s, or Loue-lock^s, (as they style
them:) which now b^gin to grow into a C^pit esse (...) citu^ quod publicu^ est.
Cypr. Epist. l. 2. Ep. 2^
common, approved, and received fashion, or use among us.

These Loue^lockes, or E^re-lockes, in which too many of our Nation have of
late begun to glory: what ever they may seem to be in the eyes, and
judgments of many humorous, singular, ^ffeminate, ruff^inly, vainglorious,
or time serving persons, who repute and deem them a very generous, necessary,
beautiful, and comely orname^t: are yet notwithstanding^ but so many (...) s^d
cri^i^^ su^t Paulinu^ Epist. 4. ad. S^uerum.
badges of infamy, effeminacy, vanity, singularity, pride, lasciviousness,
and shame, in the eyes of God, and in the judgment of all godly Christians,
and Grave or Civil men: yea, they are such unnatural, sinful, and unlawful
ornaments, that it is altogether unseemly, and unlawful for any to nourish,
use, or wear them. Lest this should seem an harsh, a ^alse, or idle Paradox,
to Ruffians, and such fantastique persons as are delighted in them. I will here
propound some arguments, and reasons to euince this true, though strange and
new Conclusion:

That the nourishing, using, or wearing of Locks, or Loue-lockes, is utterly
v^see^ely, odious, and unlawful unto Christians: and thus I prove it.

First

That which had its birth, its sou^se, and pedigree from the very Devil
himself, must needs be odio^s, unlawful, and abominable, unto Christians.

But these our Loue-lockes had their birth, their sourse, and pedigree from the
very Devil himself.

Therefore they must needs be Odious, Unlawful, and Abominable unto
Christians.

The Mayor must be yielded, because no good thing can proceed from him, who
is all and only evil, both in himself, and all his actions, as the Devil
is: the Minor I shall back and evidence, by the authority of Tertullian, who
informs us: that Alterius esse non possunt nisi Diabol^, quae Dei non sunt.
Ter^ul. de Idolo^a^ria, c. 18. De Cult^ F^em. cap. 3, 4, 5.
all things which are not of God, are certainly the Devils: But the wearing,
and nourishing of these Loue-lockes, is not from God, (no, nor yet from any of
his Saints and Children, with whom they were never in use as we can read of;)
therefore they must needs b^e from the Devil: And that they were so indeed,
we have the express authority, of a learn^d, la^e, and reverend Historian;
who i^formes us in express terms: Mr. Purchase Pilgrimage. lib. 8. c. 6.
Sect. 3.
That our sinister, and unlovely Loue-lockes, had their generation, birth, and
pedigree from the Heathenish, and Idolatrous Virginians, who took their
pattern f^^^ their Devil Ockeus: who usually appeared to them in (...)e of a
man, with a long black Lock on the left side of (...) head, hanging down to
his feet: so that if we will resolve the generation of our Loue-lockes, into
their first and true original; the Virginian D^uill Ockeus, will prove to be
the natural Father, and inuentor of them. And shall we then, who profess our
selves Christians; we who have given up our names to Christ, and so solemnly
vowed, and protested unto God in our very Baptism: to forsake the Devil and
all his Works; turn such prodigious, and incarnate Devils, as to imitate the
very Devil himself, in this his guise and portraiture, which we have so
seriously renounced in our very first initiation, and admittance into the
Church of Christ? Certainly, if the Devil himself were the first inuentor of
these fantastique and vaineglorious Loue-lockes; this very thing does stamp
such an vnlouelinesse, and unlawfulness upon them, as should cause all such
who bear the name, or face of Christians, to abhor them: this is my first
argument.

Secondly.

Admit, that this objection should chance to fail me, (though I know not how
it can well be shifted off:) yet thus I argue in the second place.

That which was, and is an Idle, Foolish, Vain, Ridiculous, Effeminate, and
Heathenish fashion, use, and custom, of Idolatrous, Rude, Lascivious, and
Effeminate Infidels, and Pagans, must needs be Sinful, and Unlawful.

But such is the nourishing, and wearing of these Loue-lockes.

Therefore they must needs be Sinful, and Unlawful.

The Mayor is irrefragable: because God himself has expr^sly Commanded all
Christians whatsoever; Leuit. 1^.30. Deuteronomy. 12.29, 30. Ier. 10.2. Mat. 6.7,
8.31, 32. Ephesians. 2.1, 2 and 4, 17, to 22. Romans 12. 2 Col. 2.20, 21 22. 1 Pet. 1,
14, 18. and 4, 2^ 3. 2 King. 17.15 Zeph. 1, 8.
not to imitate, use, or follow, the vain, unnatural, ridiculous, Effemi^ate,
or Heathenish Customes^ Fashions, Guises, Rites, or Habits of Infidels, Pagans,
Wicked, or Worldly men, but utterly to abandon and disclaim them; because
Christ Jesus has shed his rich and precious Blood, of purpose to redeem and
free them from them:

The Minor I shall evidence by sundry Testimonies: It is storied of the

Tartars, do usually shave the forepart of their Heads to their Crowns, from

their Heads, like to our Women, of which they make two traces, or Loue-lockes,
which they tie up behind their ears. The Infidel, and Idolatrous Purcha^

Virginians, do wear a long Loue-locke on the left side of their Heads (as
our English Ru^fians do) in imitation of Ockeus their Deuill-god: whence it
was, that a Virginian coming into England, blamed our English men for not
wea^ing a long lock as they did: affirming the God which we worship^ to be
no true God, because he had no Loue-locke, as their Devil Ockeus has. The

Heathenish, and Pagan Inhabitants of Duharhe do cut their Hair, leaving

In Mexico there was a Monastery of young men, who shaued the former part of
their Heads, letting the Hair on the h^nder part to grow, about the breadth of

Herodotus lib^ 4. Sect. 125.
Maxyes did use t^ pole the lef^ side of their Heads, (as our Loue-locke
wearers do the right,) suffering the Hair on the right side to grow long, in
nature of our Loue-lockes. Alex. ab Alex. Ibid. Plu^arch. Theseus. Polid.

6. verse. 4, 5.
The Priests of Sybil^ called Curetes, the AE^olians, Arabians, Ionians,
Mysians, and Machlians, did use to pole the forepart of their Heads, lest their
Enemies should take hold of their Hair; and so gain advantage of them in
their Wars: leaving their Hair long behind. Sto^aus de Intemperantia Serm^
6. Fol. 6^.^.
Musouius in his Book de Tonsura^ makes mention of some Pagans, who did not
pole all their Head alike, but did cut their Hair somewhat short before, and
let it grow long behind: This (says he) though it may seem to be somewhat
comely, yet it has much deformity in it, neither does it any whit differ
from the culture, and elegancie of Women: for they do plaite some parts of
their Hair^; other parts of it they suffer to hang down at length, and the
rest they dress after another fashion^ that they may seem more beautiful. In
like manner men who are thus polled, bewray that they desire to s^eme fair to
those whom they study to please^ whil^s they cut away some of their Hair, and
compose the rest in such a manner, as may make them seem more beautiful a^ong
Women and Children, whose praise they do affect: which is an Effeminate,
Womanish, Voluptuou^, and Unmanly thing: A worthy censure of a Pagan on these
Effeminate, and Lascivious Loue-lockes, which should cause all Christians to
abhor them. And to conclude this proof: The Purchase Pilgrimage l. 4. c. 19.
Alexand. ab Alex. Gen, Dier. l^ ^. c. 18. Gotardu^ Hist. Ind Orient c^. 52
Maffaus Ind. Hist. lib. 6 p. 270.
Idola^rous Chinians, Persians, and Dacians, though so^e of them shave their
Heads full often, yet they leave a Lock, or Tuft of Hair upon their Crowns
about two foot long, that thereby ^hey may be more e^sily carried into Heaven
after their death: A very substantial and worthy reason for the use of
Loue-lockes, if men might be carried up to Heaven by them, as these Idolaters
and Mahometans dream: whereas in truth, they serve for no other purpose, but
to give the Devil holdfast, to draw us by them into Hell: a fitting place for
such vain, Effeminate, ruffianly, Lascivious, Proud, Singular, and Fantastique
persons, as our Loue-locke wearers, for the most part are: You see now by these
precedent Histories; that the nourishing, use, and wea^ing of these unlovely
Loue-lockes, was common among Idolatrous Infidels, and Vain, Effeminate,
Barbarous, Uncivil, and Lascivious Pagans, whose Custom, Guise, and
Graceless fashions, no Christians are to imitate: (...) for my own part, I
never heard nor read as yet, that they were ever worn, used, or approved by
any Sincere, Sober, Grave, or godly Christians in former ages: Wherefore it
must needs be a shame, if not a sin for us who bear the habit and name of
Christians, to deuiate from the use and custom of our Country, and from the
pattern, and practice of the Alienum est a Catholica Ecclesia, and a
praedicatione Apostolorum, coma extensa. Vir enim, inquit, non debet putrire
coma^, cum sit imago ac gloria Dei. Epiphan. cont. Haeres. l. 3. To^. 2. Haer.

Saints in former ages, in taking up these Vain, Effeminate, Lascivious, and
unnatural Loue-lockes, in imitation of these Rude, these Barbarous,
Effeminate, Idolatrous, and Graceless Pagans, whose Guise, whose Ways, whose
Fashions, Rites, and Customs, no Christians are to follow.

Thirdly.

If these two arguments will not convince our Loue-locke wearers, then let them
hearken to a third, from which there can be no evasion.

That which is contrary to the very Word of God, and Law of Nature, must needs
be Evil, Sinful, Unlawful, and Abominable.

But the nourishing, and wearing of Loue-lockes, is contrary to the Word of
God, and Law of Nature.

Therefore it must ne^^es be Evil, Sinful, Unlawful, and Abominable.

The Mayor no man dares control, unless he will Atheistically condemn both
God and Nature too: the assumption I shall prove in both particulars: First I
say, that the nourishing, or wearing of Loue-lockes is contrary to the very
Word of God: as is manifest by Ezech. 44. 20. compared with Leuit. 29.27, and
21.5. They shall not shave, nor round, nor make bald their heads, nor suffer
their Locks to grow long, they shall only pole their Heads, and by the 1.
Cor. 11.14. where the Scripture, and Nature it self inform us: that it is a
shame for a man to wear long Hair: Now those who wear, or nourish Love
locks: they do not pole their Heads: they wear long Hair; and they suffer
their Locks to grow long: therefore they expressly oppose, and contradict the
word of God. If any now reply, that these Scriptures extend not unto such as
nourish Loue-lockes, but to such as nourish all their Hair, suffering it to
grow out unto its full and largest length; as the Epiph. contr. Haeres^s, l. 3.

Idolatrous, Barbarous, and Heathenish Nations of Modern and Ancient times;
together with some ( n) particular men, are Recorded to have done; and not of
those who only suffer a little part, and parcel of their Hair to grow long,
cutting the rest as others do:

To this I answer first; that the same law which prohibites the nourishing of
the whole, does virtually, nay, positiuely disalow the nourishing of any part:
because every part is actually included in the whole; therefore these
Scriptures do condemn all such, as nourish only their Loue-lockes, as well
as such as suffer all their Hair to grow long: Secondly, I answer; that these
Scriptures admit of no apporciament: for they command men to pole their Heads,
not part of their Heads; and not to suffer their Locks to grow long: in the
number of which Locks, these Loue-lockes are included^ especially since this
Precept is a universal Negative: Loue-lockes, are Locks: they are long Hair,
which is a shame to men that wear it; therefore they are undoubtedly included
within, and so punctually condemned by these Scriptures: Thirdly, the wearing
of these Loue-lockes, is as great, (if not a greater) badge of Leuitie.
Vanity, Singularity, and Effeminacy, as the nourishing of all the Hair:
therefore both of them are equally condemned by the Scriptures:

Secondly, as the nourishing and wearing of Loue-lockes, and long Hair, beyond
the ordinary, and decent length of the more Civil, Grave, Religious, and Sobet
rank of men, is contrary to the Word of God: even so it is directly contrary
to the Law of Nature Mai^r est natura, quam patriae. Ambr. Irenaeo, Tom. 1. p.
233 G.
which no Custom can control: Which I prove, first, by the express
Testimony of the Scriptures: 1 Cor. 11.14
Does not Nature it self teach you (says the Apostle) that if a Man have
long Hair, it is a shame unto him? but if a Woman have long Hair, it is a
Glory to her, for it is given to her for a covering: the Apostle here informed
us; that the nourishing, and wearing of long Hair in men, is See Chrysostom.

Cor. 11. accordingly, Dan. 4 33.
contrary to Nature: and he confirms this assertion, by these reasons: That
(says he) which even by the voice, and verdict of Nature, is a shame to Men;
that which is properly, and Naturally a Woman's glory: and which God, and Nature
has bequeathed unto Women, for a special use; to wit, for a See Basil. de
Virginitate ver^, Tom. 2. p. 150.151.
natural Covering, or Veil, and for a Badge, or Emblem of their subjection
to their Husbands; must needs be Unnatural, and so Unlawful unto Men: But
the wearing, and nourishing of long Hair, (and so of Loue-lockes,) even by the
voice, and verdict of Nature, is a shame to Men; it is the Natural, and proper
Glory of none but Women, to whom God, and Nature have beque^thed it for a
special use; to wit, for a natural Covering, or Veil, and for a Badge, or
Emblem of subjection to their Husbands: therefore it must needs be
Unnatural, and so Unlawful unto men, even by the Apostles Testimony:
Secondly, that which Natural, and Civil men do loathe, abhor, and utterly
condemn, even from the very grounds and principles of Nature, must needs be
opposite, and contrary to the Law of Nature: But even natural and Civil men
do utterly abhor, condemn, and loathe the nourishing, and wearing of these
Loue-lockes, and Ruffianly, or excessive long Hair; their very Hearts, and
stomachs, do rise up in indignation against them, and abhor the very sight,
and thoughts of them, (as every man's own experience can sufficiently
testify,) and that from the very grounds, and principle^ of Nature, which has
stamped, and engraven in men's Hearts, a secret antipathie, and dislike against
these Loue-lockes, and long Hair in men: Hence was it, Gu^gui^^^ rerum Polon.
Tom. 1. p. 74.
that Pope Benedict the ninth enjoined all the Polonians upon release of
Cazimir the first their King, who had entered into Religion; to cut their Hair
above their Ears, and not to suffer it to grow long: Hence was it, that
Zo^ara^ Annal^um. T^^. ^ Fol. 174.
Theophilus the Emperor enacted a Law; that all men should cut their Hair
short, and that no Roman should suffer it to grow below his neck, under pain
of severe whipping: Hence was it, that M. Speeds History of Great Britt. l. 9.
c. 4. Numb. ^4. p. 442.
King Henry the first, commanded men's long Hair to be cut off (as our
Justices, and Judges at the Assizes often times do,) as being against God, and
Natures Law: (an Iniunction which would well befit our Ruffianly times:)
therefore they must needs be contrary to the Law of Nature.

Thirdly, the very Law of Nature does instigate, and teach all Civil, Grave,
and Sober men, who live under any Good, and Civil government, to wear their
Hair of a moderate, and decent length, and to avoid the wearing, and
nourishing of these Loue-lockes, and immoderate long Hair: What is the reason
that our Nation did generally heretofore, and does yet for the most part, cut
their Hair of a Decent, Grave, and Comely manner, without any reservation of a
Loue-locke; is it not more from the very direction, law, advise, or dictate of
Tenenda nobis vita esse, quam natura praescripsit, nec ab illa declinandum.
S^n. Epist 122.
Nature, which does secretly inform them of the decency, and fitness of it,
then from any binding Law, or custom of our Country? doubtless it is. If
then Nature does teach men thus to cut their Hair: the nourishing of
womanish, and long unshorn Hair, together with the reservation of these
Effeminate, Fantastique, Ridiculous, and uncivil Loue-lockes, must needs be
contrary to the Law of Nature.

Lastly, that which savors of Leuitie, Vanity, Pride, Vain^glory,
Singularity, Eff^minacy, Wantonness, Lasciviousness, Licentiousness,
Selfe-conceitednesse, or the like, must needs be contrary to the Law of
Nature, because Vitia superuenerunt, ingesta sunt: nulli nos vitio natura
co^^^liat. Seneca Epist. 94.
these sins and vices are so: But for men to wear long Hair, or
Loue-lockes, in any Christian, or civil Commonwealth (as ours is) contrary to
the common use and practice of our Country, does savor of all these:
therefore it must needs be contrary to the Law of Nature.

Now that you may know, that it is contrary to the law of God, and Nature, for
men to wear, or nourish Loue-lockes, or extraordinary long H^ire: consider but
what the Fathe^s, and others have Recorded to this purpose: Constit. Apostol.
l. 1. c. 4^^
Clemens Romanus (if the Book be his:) enioynes men to pole their Heads, and
not to suffer their Hair to grow long, least the nourishing, and perfuming of
their Hair, should be a means to inflame their lusts, and to illaqueate, or
inamour Women with them: yea, he says ^xpr^^sely, that it is Unlawful for
any Christian, or Man of God, to frizell, or frounce, to powder or color his
Hair, to suffer it to grow long, or to fold it together, or tie it up with an
hairelace, because it is Effeminate, and contrary to the Law of God. Padag. l.

coloring, poudring, frizeling, curling, and Effeminate, and Meretricious
dressing, adorning, and composing of the Hair, both in the male, and female
sex: (a vice and fault to rife among us,) so he likewise commands men to wear
their Hair of a moderate, and decent length, and not to suffer it to grow
long, not yet to bind it up in fillets like women, as the Frankes, and
Scythians do: They says In dom^re^gis Diaboli sunt, qui capillis muliebribus

Epiphanius condem^es the Massalian heretics very much, for nourishing their
Hair like women; informing them, that long Hair was contrary to the
Catholic Church, and Apostoli^ue Doctrine; which teach us, that a man must
not wear long Hair, in as much as he is the Image, and Glory of God: so that
he which wears long Hair, does dishonor Christ his Head, and sins
against the Law of Nature, which teaches us; that it is a shame for a man to
wear long Hair: Epistola 4. ad Seuerum.

Saint Ambrose, and Him. 26. in 1. Cor 11 hom. in Matt. 88.
Saint Chrysostom, informs us, that it is a shame, yea, a great sin, for a
man to wear long Hair at any time, because it is contrary to the order of
Nature, and the Law of God; because it is given to Women by the constitution of
God, and Nature, (which ought not to be violated,) for a covering, and for a
ba^ge, and token of subjection: whence Chrysostom condemns such, who thought
Coment. in^ Soph. cap. 1. Tom. ^. p. 210.
it no small part of their Religion to nourish their Hair: Saint Hierome,
certifieth, that all such men as do Effeminately nourish their Hair, and set
it out by the Looking^glasse; (which is the proper passion and madness of
Women,) shall surely perish: Yea, Tom. 1. Epist. Ep. 8. c. 10. Ep. 10. c 4. Ep.
1^. c. 5. Ep. 47. c. 3. Com in Ezech. 44.
he condemns the wearing of long Hair, together with the Coloring,
Crisping, Frizling, and Poudring of it, as a sin and vanity: and advises
men not to shave nor make bald their Heads, as the Priests, and Worshippers of
See Baruch. 6.31.
Isis, and S^rapis did in former times; (and as the Popish Monks and
shauelings now:) nor yet to suffer it to grow long, which is proper unto
Soldiers, Barbarians, and riotous persons; but to cut it of a moderate, and
decent length: Com. in 1. Cor. 11.
Primasius informs us, that Saint Paul did expressly note, and tax the
Corinthians, for suffering their Hair to grow long: as being a scandalous, and
an offensive thing: In 1 Cor. 11 Enarratio.
Theophylact affirms, that the man who nouri^heth his Hair, is worthy of
reproof, because he does transgress the Laws of Nature, and take upon him
the habit, and form of a Woman, and a sign of subjection, against Gods own
institution; who has ordained him to be a Prince, and a Ruler: Ad militos
Templi Serm^. cap. 2. and. 4.
S. Bernard does expressly condemn all such (though they are Soldiers) who
wear long Hair; commanding them to cut their Hair, because it is a shame for
a man to nourish it: So that by these authorities, to omit See Master Dike of
the Deceitfulness of Man's heart^ cap. 17. p 1^5. Bishop Babingtons Not^s on
Numbers c. 6. Sect. 2. Stobaeus Ser. 6. De Intemperantiae.
others, the wearing of excessive long Hair, or Loue-lockes, is directly
contrary to the Law of God, and Nature: If you now object, Numb. 6.5.18. Judge.

that the Nazarites were to nourish their Hair, and not to suffer any rasor to
pass upon their heads, during the time of their vow, or separation: therefore
men may wear Loue-lockes, and long Hair: Now I answer first, that the
Nazarites had a special Command to nourish their Hair; not continually, but
till their vows were out, and then they were to cut it off: but we have now no
such command, therefore Babingtons Notes on Numbers ^. Sect. 7.8
we must ^ot do it. Secondly, they did nourish their Hair, out of obedience,
and holy devotion unto God: whereas men in our days, do nourish their Hair
and Loue-lockes, out of vainglory, pride, effeminacy, singularity,
lasciviousness, and such like sinister, and sinful ends: Thirdly, they during
the time of their separation, did nourish all their Hair, and not one small or
little portion of it, as our Loue-locke wearers do: Fourthly, they only by
the Law of God were to nourish their Hair, and none else: therefore, this
example does evidently prove; that all men else, are not to nourish, but to
clip and cut their Hair: Fifthly, the nourishing of their Hair was typical;
typifying unto us; either Christ himself, or the graces, and beauty of Christ:
or the Saints, and Church of Christ, as Ambros. de Virgin. lib. 3. de Spir.
Sancto. l 2. Pr^aemium lib. 10. in E^a^g. Luca c. 21. Babingtons Note^ on
Numbers, c. 6. Sect. 6
some observe: therefore we may, we must not imitate them, because all types
are ceased now^ Lastly, God himself commands 1 Cor. 11, 5, 6.7.15.
all such as are to pray unto him with uncovered heads, to sheare and cut their
Hair: yea, 1 Cor. 11.5, 6
if a Woman will come, and pray to God with her head uncovered (as many do)
she also is to be shorn, because she is uncovered: But all 1 Cor. 11.4, 7
men are to pray to God with uncovered heads, for as much as they are the
Image, and glory of God, and to express that holy reverence, and fear which
they owe to him: (especially in the Mat. 21 13.
House and place of Prayer, or Presence Chamber of their Lord and God, where
most men now a days sit covered; as if they owed no reverence, fear, nor
service, to the Lord; or as if they came for to outface him, and not to pray,
and stoop unto him:) Therefore all m^n are to cut their Hair, and not to
nourish it as the Nazarites did; because it is against the Law of God, and
Nature: Loue-lockes, and excessive long Hair beyond the ordinary, grave, and
decent length, are both against the Laws of God, and Nature, as I have already
proved; and will any man then be so ungodly, or unnatural, as still to wear
and nourish them, and not to cut them off? Let Ru^^ians, and professed
Loue-locke wears, now at last consider this; that they transgress the Laws
of God, and Nature. If then they are, or will be Christians, as they profess
themselves to be, let this Law of God instruct them: if they are but natural
and carnal men, let then this Bonorum vnum propositum est consentire naturae
Seneca Epist. ^6. Leges natura euertere magnae est impudentiae, and non solum
nobiscum, sed eti^m cum natura pugnare. Chrysostom. hom 26. in 1 Cor. 11.
Law of Nature teach them, to cassheere their ruffianly Hair, and Loue-lockes
for the time to come, for fear they fight against thems^lues and nature; and
so incur the everlasting penalty, and censure, both of the Law of God, and
Nature, at the last.

But it may be some will here object and say; that the Hair, and Loue-lockes
which they wear, are supposititious, false, and counterfeit, and not their
own: therefore they violate no Law of God, nor Nature, since the long Hair
they use, is but borrowed, and aduenticious, their own being sh^rt enough:
perchance, but little or none at all.

To this I answer first; that the wearing of counterfeite, false, and
supposititious Hair, is See Bishop Halls Quo vadis, Sect. 21. Mr. Bolton in
his general Directions for our comfortable Walking with God, p. 195.20^.
accordingly.
utterly unlawful, though it be now so rife and common, both in our
Masculine, and Female sex: First, because we have no Precept, no Record, no
Warrant, nor Example for it in the Scriptures, Psalm. 119.9, 105. Gal 6.1^. 1

Medes, (not any Saints, nor Christians that we can read of,) were the first
that used this false, and counterfeite Hair: therefore Christians may not use
it. Secondly, because God has given every man and woman such Hair, as is most
natural, and suitable unto them, of purpose that they should wear and use it,
and not contemn it, nor be ashamed of it: those therefore who dislike the
quantity, or quality of that Hair, which Gods wisdom has assigned to
them, and therefor purchase the hairie excrements of some other person, to
Adorn and Beautify their Heads with all; must needs incur Gods Judgment;
because they tax and censure God, and labor to correct, and change his Work:
Thirdly, because this wearing of false and counterf^ite Hair, does always
arise from pride and vainglory: in that we desire to Faemina canictem.

be more beautif^ll, and comely then God has made us: or from concupiscence, ^r
vncleann^sse, in that we seek to inescate, and inamour those with this
artificial and acquisite Hair, and beauty, which our own natural Hair,
and feature would not move: or from a vain, and sinful leuitie of mind,
whereby we desire to take up, and follow ^he vain, abominable, wicked, and
worldly guises, fashions, and customs of the times, which Christians must,
Romans 12.2. 1 Pet 1.14.1^. Col. 2.20.22.
abominate: or out of a vainglorious, and fantastique desire of singularity,
or differencing our selves from others: or out of an intent, or purpose to
delude, and cosen others, by persuading them by this Hellish wile: that our
Hair, and so our Complexions, Constitutions, and Conditions, (which are often
discovered by the Hair,) are not the same they are: or out of a cursed
obstinacy, Rebellion, and Disobedience to God, and to his Laws, or to the
Counsel, Advice, and Admonition of his Saints, and Ministers, whom we purpose
and intend to cross, to thwart and grieve, by our Rebellious, Graceless,
Wanton, and Ungodly lives: These I say, or some of these, are the only true,
and proper grounds, and ends, why Men or Women wear this false, and
counterfeite Hair; now these are all Unlawful, Wicked, and Abominable:
therefore, the very wearing of this ascititious Hair, must be so too: This
Clemens Alexandrinus knew full well: whence he informs us; Paedag. l. 3. cap.
11.
That false and counterfeite Hair, is utterly to be rejected, and that it is a
very wicked thing, to attire the head, with dead and ascititious Hair. For on
whom does the Elder lay his hands? Whom does he bless? Not the Man or
Woman, who are thus attired; but another Hair, and by it, another head. If
then the Man be the Woman's head, and Christ the Man's: how can it but be a
wicked fact for a Woman to wear false Hair, by which she falls into a double
sin? For they deceive their Husbands by their excessi^e Hair; and they
disgrace the Lord, as much as in ther^ lies, whiles they are whor^shly attired
to the deceit of the truth, and accurse that head, which is truly beautiful;
thus far Clemens. Tertullian writing against the pride and vain attires of
Women, condemns their false, and counterfeit^ Hair among the rest: De C^ltu
Famin^ru^ ^^p. 4.5.
Moreover ye annex (says he) I know not what enormities of Periwiges, and
counterfeit^ Hair; sometimes upon the crown of the head like an Hat;
sometimes behind in the poll: It is a strange thing, that they thus strive
against the commandments of the Lord. It is written, that no man can add to
his stature: yet you add unto your weight, by adding Bracelets, and Bosses to
your necks: If you are not ashamed of the enormitie, yet be ashamed of the
defilement; lest thou annex to thy Christian and holy head, the excrements, or
spoil of some strange, perhaps some unclean and sinful head, that is
destinated unto Hell it self: wherefore thrust away this bondage of attire
from your foreheads. You labor to seem beautiful in vain; in vain do you
send for the most exquisite Tire-women: God commands you to be veiled; lest
any part of your heads should be seen. Would to God I wretched man could lift
up my head among you in the day of Christ's exaltation, to see whether or no you
should rise again, with the same varnish, painting, and head attire, which now
you bear; or whether the Angels should take you up into the Clouds, to meet
Christ Jesus as you are now attired, and set out: If these things be good, and
of God now, they would then accompany you, and enjoy their places in the
Resurrection: but nothing can rise again, but pure flesh and Spirit; therefore
these things which rise not again, neither in the flesh, nor spirit, are
condemned, because they are not of God. Abstain from damned things, for the
present: Let God now find you such, as he shall find you then. Tom. 1.

Saint Hierome, and Saint Chrysostom, tax all such, for Graceless, Carnal,
and Worldly persons, who paint their faces, who frounce, and curle their Hair,
or adorn, attire, and set out their heads with false, and borrowed Hair: De
habitu Virgin. ^ract. Epist. 4. ad Se^^rum.
Saint Cyprian, and Paulinus, also do the like; therefore, by the voice and
verdict of the Fathers, concurring with the precedent reason, the wearing of
false and counterfeite Hair, either in Men or Women, must needs be sinful
and unlawful: Fourthly, it must needs be so, because Fieri non potest, non
potest, inquam, fieri vt ver^m ostendat animam qui capu^ habet adulterinum.
^lem. Alexand. P^^ag. l 3. c. 3.
it is impos^ible, that he or she, should have a true; a sound, sincere, and
upright heart, who has a false, a counterfeite, and deceitful head: A false,
a vain, or proud head, is always a presage, resemblance, or concomitant of an
hollow, vain, and hautie heart. Hence was it; Plutarch. Apotheg.
that King Philip associating a friend of Antipaters, with his Judges,
perceiving him afterward to color his Hair, and Beard, removed him from
his place: affirming, that he could not believe, that such a one would prove
Just, and Faithful, in the determination of causes, who was so perfidious, and
treacherous to his own Hair: As a proud head, and an humble heart, or a
lascivious, vain, and meritricious head, and an honest, modest, chaste, and
sober heart, do seldom, or never go together: So Nihil sani dicere potest,
qui non animum tantum gerit mendacem sed etiam caput. AElian. Variae Hist. l.
7. cap. 20.
a false, a counterfeite, an artificial, or aduenticious Head, or Face, and an
Honest, Upright, Faithful, Tr^e, and gracious Heart, do seldom (and if I am
not much mistaken,) never meet, in one, and the selfsame person. Such as the
Head is, such is the Heart, there being such a mutual, and reciprocal
intercourse between the Head, and the Heart: that a false Heart, will quickly
vitiate, and corrupt, an honest, natural, plain, and modest Head; and a
counterfeite, and artificial Head, an upright, true, and humble Heart. Since
therefore, the wearing of aduenticious Hair; (which the Lascivious Alteriu^

proud, deceitful, and immodest Heart; it cannot but be evil, and utterly
unlawful unto such, who practice, or profess Religion. Lastly, the Clem.

else out of a desire to cover, and conceal their baldness, (for which

injury to the work, and Wisdom of God, and to this speech of Christ, as
those that color, powder, paint, or dye their Hair: therefore they must
needs offend God in it: and so by consequence, the wearing of false, and
coun^erfeite Hair, or Love locks, must needs be evil. But admit that it
were Lawful, either for men or women, to wear this borrowed, false, or
apposititious Hair, which I can never grant: yet for men to wear it of an
excessi^e length, must needs be evil: As men who wear false Hair, or
Periwigs, do commonly affirm, lurat capillos esse, quos emit, suos Fabula,

and swear them to be their own, (pe^haps, upon this evasion, that they have
paid well for them:) and would have all men deem them for their natural, and
native Hair; so they ought to wear them of the same proportion, length, and
fashion, as if they were their proper Hair, without the reservation of a
Lock: because the rules for naturall^ must regulate, an^ square out the length
of artificia^l Hair. So that a man must neitheir wear a natural, no^
artificial, borrowed, or aduenticious Lock, because it is contrary to the
Word of God, and Law of Nature: which is my third, but not my meanest argument,
against these Loue-lockes.

Fourthly.

That which is an ordinary, and common Badge, or Emblem of Effeminacy, Pride,
Vainglory, Lasciviousness, Inciuilitie, Licentiousness, and Deboistnesse:
must needs be Odious, Unseemly, and Unlawful unto Christians.

But the wearing^ and nourishing of these Loue-lockes, is an ordinary, and
common Badge, or Emblem of Effeminacy, Pride, Vainglory, Lasciviousness,
Inciuilitie, Licentiousness, and Deboistnesse.

Therefore it must needs be Odious, Unseemly, and Unlawful unto Christians.

ribbands: by the suffrage of Fortem vocemus, cuius ^orrentes comae maduer^
nardo? Hercules Furens.
Seneca the Tragedian: who au^rreth; that none can style him a valiant man,
whose long staring Hair is bedewed with spicknar: and by the practice of
Aristodemus the Tyrant: Dionis. Hallicarnas. Romans Antiqu. l. 7 c. 1
who when he would Effeminate the Cumaeans, for fear they should rebel
against him: enjoined them to nourish their Hair, and to bind it up in trusses
or fi^^ets like Women. Long haeire then (much more the nourishing of a Frizled,
Poudred, and fantastique Loue-locke) must needs be an Effeminati omnes fucato
com^ nitore gaudent: ac palam quidam ^j qui in lupa^ari prae^tant: quasi hoc
maxim modo muliebre genus imitari possint. Nos vero aedolescente^ Pathicorum
modo muliebria appetente^, capillis significam^s. Synesius: Caluitij En^omium.
Emblem, and Ensign of Effeminacy, Lasciviousness, and Vainglory. And
does not our own experience testify as much? What Wise, what Grave, what
Religious, or Judicious man among us is there; but when he beholds a man that
wears a Lock, will presently repute, and deem him, either an Eff^minate,
Lascivious, or Wanton person: or a Proud, a Singular, Humourous, Fantastique,
or Vainglorious Spirit: or a Deboist, a Riotous, Licentious, and Prodiall
Ruffian; or a Summo apud imperitos coma in praeti^ est. Ibid.
vain, a shallow pated, a giddy-headed, or newfangled Nouice: even from this
very ground, because he wears a Lock: Most that wear these Locks, are
notoriously known to be such as these: wherefore men upon the very first view
deem them such; because their Locks describe, discipher, and proclaim them
to be such. The Minor therefore must be granted, and the conclusion too.

Fifthly.

That which is Odious, Non ^p^rtet solum a vetitis absti^ere, sed etiam a
co^cessis, quando fuerit Scandalum. Chryost. Hom. 26 ^n 1 Cor. 12. i
Scandalous, Offensi^e, and of ill report among the Best, the Holiest, the
Wisest, Grauest, and Ciuiler sort of Men, Int^r^st t^^ p^rfectionis and
^^l^^res, and m^l^ pariter ^p^^tes deui^^re. In alter^ conscienti^, i^ alter^
fa^^ consulis. Pu^ ^ t^b^ (...) licer^ (ets^ alia^ fortasse liceat) quicquid
^ale fuer^t coleratum. Bern. de Considerat. l. 3. c. 4.
^^^t needs be Evil, Sinful, and Unlawful unto Christians: witness Romans
12.17. 1. Cor. 10.32, 33. Phil. 2.15, 16. and chap. 4.8. which are expre^^e in
point.

But such is the nourishing, and wearing of Loue-locke, as experience
testifies: for the Best, the Holiest, the Wisest, Gra^est, and Ci^iler sort of
Men, both young and old: as they condemn it in their practice, in that they
wear, and use no Locks as others do; so they reject, and censure,
Loue-lockes in their Judgments, as Vain, Effeminate, Odious, Uncivil,
Fantastique, Lascivious, Unnatural, Licentious, Humourous, and indecent
Vanities, which suite not well with Civil Men, much less with Christians.

Therefore they must needs be Evil, Sinful, and Unlawful unto Christians.

Sixthly.

That which in its very best acception, is but a mere Ridiculous, Foolish,
Childish, and Fantastique toy, or Vanity; must needs be Evil, Sinful,
Unlawful, and Unseemly unto Christians.

But the nourishing, and wearing of Loue-lockes, in its very best acceptance,
is but a mere Nihil aliu^ s^nt, qua^ d^liram^^t^ i^consider^t^ leuitati^:
Lact. De Fals^ Sapientia. cap. 2^.
Ridiculous, Foolish, Childish, and Fantastique toy, or Vanity.

Therefore it ^ust needs be Eui^^, Sinful, V^lawful, and Unseemly unto
Christians.

The Mayor is without control; because God himself enioynes us: Psalm. 4.2.
Psalm. 119.37. Prou. 30.8.
not to delight in vanity; 1 Samuel 12.2^ Isay 55.2.
not to follow after vain things, which cannot profit, nor do us good in our
latter end; Ps. 24.3.4.
not to lift up our hearts unto vanity, for they which do so, shall never
ascend into the hill of the Lord. For the truth of the Minor, I appeal not
only to the voice, and verdict, of all Ci^ill, Grave, Religious, wise, and
sober men; who deem these Loue-lockes, Foolish, and Fantastique toys, and
Vanities; but likewise to the Consciences, and Judgments of Firmum est genus
probationis, quod etiam ab aduersario sumit^r; vt veritas etiam ab ipsis
veritatis inimicis probetur. Te^tul. de Trinit. lib.
such as wear these Loue-lockes, and are most of all devoted, and inclined to
them: who when they are demanded, why they nourish them; can yield no other
true, or solid ground, or reason for it, but only this, which is far worse then
none at all: that it is only the Leuitie, and Vanity of their minds: or the
Foolish, and Fantastique custom, Humor, and fashion of the Times, and nothing
else, that mooues them to it. So that these Loue-lockes, even in the eyes, and
Judgments of such as do adore them most, are but idle toys, and foolish
vanities: and therefore Christians may, nay, must not use them.

Seventhly.

That which is a badge, a note, or Ensign, of wilful, and affected
singularity: a violation of the decent, laudable, and received fashion, guise,
and custom of our Country: and a kind of breach of civil society among
men: must needs be odious, unseemly, See Bishop Halls Contemplations l. 15.
Hanun and David's Ambassadors, accordingly.
Unlawful, and unwarrantable.

But the wearing, and nourishing of Loue-lockes, is a badge, a note, or
Ensign, of wilful, and affected singularity: a violation of the decent,
laudable, and received fashion, guise, and custom of our Country: and a kind
of breach of civil society among Men.

Therefore it must needs be Odious, Unseemly, Unlawful, and Unwarrantable.

The Mayor is warranted, not only by the grounds of State, and Policy: which
condemn all innouations, and factious singularity, as well in habits,
fashions, manners, and attiers, as in Laws, and Government: and deem the
Co^suetudi^es patriae nihil minus qua^ leges obseruandae sunt. Stobaeus. S^r.
39.
ancient Customs, Guises, and F^shions of a Country, as obseruable, and
vn^iolable, as the very fundamental Laws, and Statutes of it: but likewise by
the rules of Christianity, and Religion: which condemn all 1 These. 2.15.
singularity, strangeness, and contrariety, not only in Ier. ^.19. Leuit.
18.30. Deuteronomy. 12.29.30.
Manners, but in Zeph. 1.^. Isay. 3.1^, to 2^.
Aparell, Leuit. 1^.27 and 21.^. 2 Sa^. 10.4, 5.1. Cor. 11.14.
Hair, and Isai. 3.16.17
Gestures too; enioyning all Christians: though not Romans 12.2. Eph^. 2.2. and 4
17.18.19. Col. 2 20.21.22. 1 Pet. 4.2, 3.
to conform themselves, to the Carnal, Idl^, Si^^full, Vain, Lascivious,
Proud, and Want on Fashions of the world, 1 Pet. 1.14.18. Reu. 13.3.4
from which Christ Jesus has Redeemed them: Yet as much as in them lye^, Romans
12, 15. to 19. and 15.5 6. 1 Cor. 1.10. Ephesians. 4.3. Iam. 3 14. to 18.
to live lovingly, and pea^eably with all men; endeavoring to keep the unity
of the Spirit in the bond of Love; 1 Cor. 10.32 33. 1 ^im. 2.2 Romans 13.1.7, 8.
1 Timothy ^.12.13. to 17. and 3.8.16. Justin Martyr. Apolog. 1. and 2 Tertul.
Apolog. Adu. Gent.
by confining themselves to the laudable, ancient, decent, comely, and received
fashions, and custom of the State, and Country where they live; as far
f^orth, as they are consonant, and not repugnant to the Law of God, or Nature.
The Minor is most clear and evident, by its own light: For is not this a
Badge, a Note, or Ensign of Wilful, Factious, and Affected ingularitie, (and
so of Pride, and Self-conceit, Prosper. Aquit. De vita Contempl. l. 3. cap. 2
3.8.
which are the Nurse, and Mother of it:) for some few particular, or private
Guiddy, Braine-sicke, Humourous, Vainglorious, and Fantastique Spirits, to
introduce a newfangled Guise and Fashion, of nourishing and wearing
Loue-lockes, without any public warrant, or allowance; contrary to the Manner,
Custom, Use, and Tonsure of our own, or other Civil, Grave, Religious, Wise,
and P^udent Na^ions: that so they may d^ff^rence, distinguish, and divide
themselves from others of the common rank and Cut, Pudet ^os Nationis suae,
quod non Germani aut Galli sint procreati, ita Patriam cap^llo transferunt.
Tertul De Cultu F^em. cap^ 4.
as if they were ashamed of their native Country: or as if C^r frater tib^
dicor ex ^beris, and Cel^is genitus, Tagique ciuis? An vultu similes videmm
esse? Tu flexa niti^us, coma vagaris: Hispanus ego contumax capill^s. Martial.
Epigram. lib. 10. Epigram. 58.
they were descended from some other Nation, or Goue^n^d by some other
Customs, Laws, or Constitutions, then others of their Contrymen, Fellows,
Kindred, Neighbors, and Companions are? Certainly, if this be not Affected,
Gross, and Wilful Singularity, there is no such thing as Singularity, or
breach of Civil society in the World. This Martial, and Tertullian knew:
whence, they condemn such for Singular, and Fantastique persons, who varied
from the cut and Tonsure of their Country, as their authorities in the Margent
testify: Suetonii Nero Sect. 51. See Doctor Hackwels Apology. l. 4. c. 9.
Sect. 1.
It was noted as a point of Shamelessness, and Singularity in Nero, though an
Emperor; that he oftentimes wore his Hair combed backward into his poll, in
an affected, and over curious manner, after the Greek fashion: If this were
Effeminacy, and Singularity in a Roman Emperor, much more are Loue-lockes, in
our French-English Subjects. I have read of some Di^othi historia Gall. l. 5 p.
424.
Humourous, and Singular persons in France, who came at last to be styled Secta
Rasorum, or the Sect of Shauelings: because they shaued off one side of their
Beardes; 2 Samuel 10.4.5.
as Hanun shaued off one half of the Beardes of David's messengers in contempt,
and scorn:) that so they might be known, and differenced from other men: and
may not our Loue-locke wears, Pars Maxillarum tonsa est tibi, pars tibi rasa
est: pars vulsa est: vnum quis putet esse caput. Martial. Epigr. l. 8. Epigr 46.
who pole one side of their heads, and let the other grow long^ of purpose to
discriminate themselves from others; be styled a Sect, and Faction as well as
they? Herodotus lib 4 Sect. 124. Alexand ab Alex. Genesis Di^rum. l 5 c. 18
The Maxyes, are taxed, and noted by Historians, as a Singular, Fantastique,
and Auerse kind of people: for polling the left side of their heads only, and
letting the right side grow long, and bushie, contrary to the fashion of all
other Nations: and may not our fickle, and unconstant Englishmen, who pole the
right side of their heads, and let the left grow out into Ruffianly, and
^ffeminate Loue-lockes, contrary to the Guise, and Fashion of their Country,
incur the selfsame censure? undoubtedly they may. If a man should seriously
propound this question, to any of our Loue-locke Ruffians: what are the proper,
true, and genuine grounds, or motives, that induce and move them for to wear
these Locks, contrary to the practice, and custom of their Country, and of
the Ciuiler, Grauer, and more Religious sort of men? their Hearts, and
Consciences, could give no other answer, but only this: that Pride, and
Singul^ritie, are the only grounds, and causes of it: Causa praecipua mihi
vid^tur ^uiu^ mali, vitae comunis fastidium. Non ^portet i^ facer^ quod
populus. Res sord^da est tritae ac vulgari via viuere. Seneca. Epist. 122.

Rusticum putatur omn^ quod vulgar, quod ^aturale est. Hierom. Tom. 1. Epi^t.
22. c. 13.


The reason why they loathe that natur^ll plain and common cut, which every
man observes, and choose this new one of their own; is only this: because they
would be singular, and somewhat different from the v^lger Crew: or because
they would imitate some Frenchefied, or outlandish Mounseir, who has nothing
else to make him famous, (I should say infamous,) but an Effeminate, Ruffianly,
Ugly, and d^formed Lock. And is not this a sure Badge, and Character, of
Singularity, and Averseness: is it not a kind of breach, of civil society;
and a violation of the Guise, the Fashion, and Laud^ble, Dec^n^, and app^ooued
custom of our Country, Bishop Halls Contemplations, lib. 15. Hanun and David's
Ambassadors, accordingly.
from which we ought not for to vary, without some grand, or weighty cause:) to
contemn the civil Cut, and ancient Tonsure of our Country, as if we were
ashamed of, or dis^ontented with it; and to follow this newfangled, Horret
cap^llis vt Marinus, asperi^ Echinus, aut currens ^per. Horace. Epodon. lib^
Epod. 5^
Horred, Strange, Misshapen, Womanish, and Outlandish Guise, and Fashion, which
does in a manner separate, and divide us from the community and body of our
proper Nation, as if we had no harmony, nor communion with it; or were no
limbs, nor members of it? undoubtedly it is. Wherefore, we may justly say of
all our impudent, Ruffianly, and shameles^e Loue-locke fosterers, (who are
Odious, and blameworthy, even in this respect, Turpis est omnis p^rs suo
vniuerso non congruens. August. Confess. lib. 3. cap. 8.
that they suite not with that whole, of which they do profess themselves a
part,) as Saint Paul did of the Jews in a different case: 1 Thessalonians. 2.15.
that they please not God, and are contrary to all men: Their very Locks are
Badges of Humourous, Nulla peior est consue^udo aut ipsis reb^spublicis, aut
famil^is, quam si vnusquisque semper pro sua libidine vi^at. Dionys. Halicar.
Romans Antiqu. l. 5. Sect. 10.
Licentious, Pernicious, and wilful Singularity: they are breaches of civil
society, and infringments of the Tonsure, Guise, and Fashions, of our
Country: therefore they must needs be Evil, Sinful, and Unlawful
vanities, which we should all renounce.

Eghtly.

That which serves for no Necessary, Laudable, Profitable, nor Decent use at
all: that which brings in no Glory at all to God, nor good, or profit unto Men
in any kind: must needs be Evil, Vain, and utterly Unlawful unto
Christians; the end and scope of all whose actions, should be the praise and
glory of God, and their own, or others good. 1. Cor. 11.30, 31, 32. 1. Pet.
4.11.

But the nourishing, or wearing of Loue-lockes, does serve Quid tibi nunc
^olles prodest coluisse capillo^, Sapeque mut^ta^ dispos^isse coma^^ Quid fuco
splendente comas redi^ire, quid illas Artificis docta subsecuisse manu?
Tibullus Eleg. l. 1. El. 8. Quid iuuat or^ato procedere vita capillo? Aut quid
Orentea crines perfundere myrrha? Teque peregrini^ vendere ^uneribus? Naturaque
decus mercato perdere cultu? Pro. pert^ Eleg. l. 1. El. 2
for no N^ce^sary, Laudable, Profitable, nor Decent use at all, that can be
thought of. It brings no Glory at all to God, nor no good to those that wear
them: they are mee^e superfluous, unuseful, and unnecessary vanities in their
very best acception: there is no good, no use, nor profit in them, that ever I
could hear of.

Therefore it must needs be Evil, Vain, and utterly Unlawful unto
Christians.

Ninthly.

That which is an ordinary occasion, or cause of Sin, and Evil, both to the
Wearers, and Spectators, must needs be Odious, Sinful, and Unlawful:
witness Matthew. 6^13. 1. These. 5.22. which are full in point.

But Loue-lockes are an ordinary occasion, or cause of Sin, and Evil, both
to the Wearers, and Spectators, of them.

Therefore they must needs be Odious, Sinful, and Unlawful things.

The Mayor needs no confirmation: the Minor, I shall prove in two
particulars. First, that Loue-lockes are an occasion, or ordinary cause of
Sin, and Evil, to the Wearers, and that in these respects. First, in that
they cause them to Exalt themselves, and to Triumph, and Glory in them, as if
they were a Dignity, Honor, or Advancement to them: as if they did enhance
their Valor, Worth, and Bea^tie, and make them better then themselves, or
others, in their own retired thoughts: whence, they often times cause their
Hearts to swell with secret pride, in so much, that they do privily disdain,
neglect, and undervalue all such persons who either want them, or condemn
them. Secondly, in that they often ti^es cause a prodigal, vain, and great
expense, sufficient to relieve the wants, and miseries of many poor distressed
Christians, who starve for want of succor and re^iefe. Much is the cost, and
great the disbursements, which many lavish out upon their Hair, and
Loue-lockes. So that we c^nnot say as Plutarch. Apothegmata.
Charillus did; that Hair is the cheapest, and least costly ornament of all
other^, which made the Lacedaemonians for to nourish it, since it is now so
costly, and expensiue unto diverse: How many hundreds are there now among v^,
whose heads are almost as chargeable, and expensiue to them, as their backs,
or bellies? whose Barbars stipend does exceed their Ministers? who bestow
more cost upon their Hair, and Loue-lockes, then their Souls? who spend more
weekly, quarterly, or monthly on their Hairie excrements, then they bestow
Ann^ally, on Christ's poor members? how many poor Christians would those
stipends, and expenses nourish, which many lavish out so largely on their
Locks, and Hair; that all their Charity, and Bounty, turns to excrement;
being so smothered, hid, or fast entangled in their costly Hair, and Frizled
Loue-lockes, that none but such as marshall, and set out their Locks, can
find them out? this prodigal expense therefore, which these Locks, and long
Hair cause, does prove them to be a means of Sin, and Evil to those who
wear, and nourish them. Thirdly, they are such, in that they cause a great
mispence, and loss of rich and precious Time. Many are those Peerless,
Precious, Rich, and mo^ning Hours, which diverse spend from day, to day, in
Ordring, Dressing, Combing, Poudring, Platting, (nay, Curling, and Crisping) of
their Hair, and Loue-lockes; Council. Constantinop. 6. Can. 9. and. 96.

Pagans have condemned; as a Badge, and clear Prognosticke of a Meriticious,
Proud, Vainglorious, False, and sinful Heart: as an Allectiue^ Bait, and
Prologue, or Ba^d, and Pander to Uncleanness: and as an Effeminate,
Unnatural, Vain, Lascivious, Fantastioue, Proud, Unchristian, Heathenish, and
Graceless practice. Much is the time, that many spend between the Comb and
the Glass, in Viewing, Ordering, Platting, Frouncing, Poudring^ and curling of
these goodly Eare-iewels, or else in dallying, and playing with them. Many
there are, (I may be bold to speak it,) who spend more time, more thoughts,
and pains upon their Hair, and Loue-lockes, week, by week, then upon God
himself, their Souls, or Christian duties: as if they were borne for no
other purpose, but to manure, and adore their Excrements, whiles their Souls
lies rotting and utterly neglected, in the very sorded rags, and dregs of
Sin: so that they are an occasion of much ill unto them, even in this respect.
Fourthly, they are so; in that they commonly incroach so far upon their
disordred affections, that they ouer-affect, and dote so much upon them at the
last; as not to part with them upon any terms; but to bid battle, and
defiance unto all, who shall dislike, or speak against them, or offer any
violence, or abuse unto them: whence it some times comes to pass, that these
unlovely jewels, are made the ground and cause, of many Fatal, Tragical, and
bloody Duels, Quarrels, and events, as some late experiments can abundantly
testify. May I not truly say of many, that they are so inamored, and besotted
with their Locks, that they would hazard, and engage their lives in their
quarrel, and defense? that like Maffa^i Hist. ^n^. lib. 11. p. 55^.557.
Gotardus Hist. Indiae Orient. cap. 54.
the Chinians, or Indian Iaponites, they deem it an insufferable contumely,
and capital offense, for any to touch them, or disorder them, much more to
speak against them, or to cut them off, which is almost as much as present
death; and that they would rather part with their lives, then Locks? It is
French Histo^y. p. 7.
storied of one Clotilde, a Queen of France, that she chose rather to have the
heads of young Sons cut off, then to suffer them to be pold, or shaven, which
would have been an indignity, and dishonor to them: and are there not many
now among us, so far inamored with their Effeminate, and unseemly
Loue-lockes, that they would rather lose their heads, then them? Undoubtedly
there are: so far do vanities infatuate, and poss^sse men's hearts, when once
they suffer their affections to run out upon them. Fifthly, they are so to
them, in that they are the cause of much Effemin^cy, Dalliance, Wantonness,
Lasciviousness, and Uncleanness in them: Whence, Saint Heirom does Tom. 1.
Epist 8. cap 10. c. ^. Epist. 19. c. 5. Epist. 22. c. ^2. Epist. 47. c 3. Sea

often times admonish Women, to avoid, and quite d^cline, comatos,
calamistratosque iuuenes, such youngsters as wore either long, or frizled
Hair: virosque qu^bus Feminei contra Apostolum crines: and men of long, and
womanish Hair, contrary to the Apostles prescript: as being Lustful, and
Lascivious persons: Hence was it, that Synesius, Calu^t^^: Enco^mium.

Poets, when as they would Delineate, Portraiture, Discipher, or set out an

Amorous, Curled, or Embroidered Hair: to signify, that A Comae studiosius A

long^ or amorous Hair, either in Men or Women, is often times an incendiary, a
provocation, occasion, or cause of Lust, Effeminacy, Lasci^iousnesse, and
Uncleanness in them: whence, your Curtezans and amorous Pictures, (which the

Owners and Spectators of them, must needs be Evil, and Unlawful, even in
this respect. Sixthly, they cannot but be so; in that they give offense,
distaste, and scandal unto others, to whom they are a grief, and eyesore: now
this Mat. 18.6, 7.8. Romans 14.13 to 23. 1 Cor. 8.7. to 14. and 10 32. 2 Cor.
6.3. See Calvin. Instit. l. ^. c. 1^. Sect. 11.12.13.
giving of just offense, and scandal unto others, is a Sin: Therefore these
Loue-lockes, are an ordinary occasion of Sin, or cause of Evil, even to
those that wear them.

Secondly, they are such to the spectators, and beholders of them; and that in
these respects. First, in giving an ill example to those of the more
Effe^inate, Fantastique, Singular, Licentious, and Vainglorious rank; who
are Inter causa^ mal^rum nostrorum est, quod viuimus ad exempla: nec ratione
componimur, sed consuetudine abducimur. Seneca. Epist. 123.
often times induced by their ill president, and example, Dociles imitandis

to imitate, and second them in this Effeminate, Lascivious, Fantastique,
Singular, Licentious, Ru^^ianly, Unnatural, and Vain glorious guise. Hence it
is, that most men have no other Apology, Plea, nor justification for the
nourishing, and wearing of their Locks, but only this: that it is Qu^l^^ sun^

and we are but their Ecchos, Shadows, Apes, or counterp^nes; and trace but
their footsteps: if they would but abandon them, then we would too, who desire
to conform our selves to their cut, and fashion: Secondly, they are such, in
that they animate, and confirm others, (especially, those of the Female sex,)
in their Lascivious, Eff^minate, Singular, Antique, Unchristian, and
Vainglorious Guises, Fashions, and Attires: When Sed vitare viros cultum

which all Gracious, Modest, Grave, Religious, Chaste, and godly Christians
should abhor, as the liueries of Satan, and badges of the world. Thirdly,
they are such to others; in that they administer occasion to them, to Tax, and
Censure such as wear, and nourish them, for Proud, Effeminate, Fantastique,
Singular, Humourous, Vainglorious, Licentious, Disolute, and Lascivious
persons: because the most that wear them are such; and so to have perhaps, an
uncharitable opinion of them, and to pass an hard, a ^ash, and heady censure
on them, even Mat 7.1. John 7.24. Rom 14.13. 1 Cor. 4.5.
against the rules of Charity, and Christianity: which enjoin us to hope,
and judge the best of all men, v^lesse their lives extort the contrary.
Fourthly, they are such to others, in that they 2 Pet. 2 7.
offend, and grieve, yea, and often distemper the Souls, of many Devout,
Religious, Gracious, Grave, and civil Christians, yea, and of many Sober,
Civil, Grave, and moderate Carnal men: who utterly condemn, and disapprooue
them in their iudg^ments, as well as in their practice. Fifthly, they are such
to others, in that they bring a scandal, and imputation, not only on Religion
it self, which suites not with such Idle, and Fantastique vanities, or
Lascivious guises: but even upon our Mollities paucoru^, labes ^st plurimorum

whole Nation: which is often times taxed of Lasciviousness, Effeminacy,
Leuitie, Vanity, Inconstancy, Guiddinesse, Licentiousness, Deboistn^sse, and

all these respects, they cannot but be Odious, Evil, Unseemly, and Unlawful
unto Christians.

Lastly.

That whose maine, whose chief, and utmost end is Evil, Sinful, Vain, and
Odious: must needs be Evil, Odious, Unseemly, and utterly Unlawful unto
Christians.

But the maine, the chief, and utmost end of nourishing, and wearing
Loue-lockes, is Evil, Sinful, Vain, and Odious.

Therefore it must needs be Evil, Odious, Unseemly, and utterly Unlawful
unto Christians.

endeavor to evidence, and make good the Minor, by ex^mining, and scaning all
those several, Genuine, True, and proper ends, for which men wear, or nourish
Loue-lockes; which are one of these: The first end and ground, for which men
wear and nourish them, is either an Nihil est facilius quam amictum imit^ri

Imitation of, or a conformity to the Vain, the Wanton, Immodest, and
Lascivious, Guises, and Fashions of the Times; or of some Licenti^u^,
Ruffianly, Lascivious, Fantastique, Humourous, Effeminate, Proud, Unconstant,
Vaine^glorious, or Outl^ndi^h persons, whose Fashions, and Tonsure we admire.
Now this very end must needs be Evil; since God himself Commands us, Romans
12.2. 1 Pet 1.14.
not to conform our selves to the Guise, and Fashion of the World, according
to the former Lusts in our ignorance: Col. 2.20.21
not to subject our selves to the Rudiments, Lusts, and Ordinances of Carnal,
or Worldly men: Ephesians. 2.2. and 4.18. Romans 13.13, 14.
not to walk as the Gentiles do, in the vanity of our minds, according to
the course, and fashion of the World: 1 Pet. 4.2.
not to live the rest of our time to the Lusts of men, but to the will of God:
M^th 6.8. 1 Co^. 7.23
not to be the Servants, Apes, or followers Men: Ephesians 5 1.
but to be the followers, and imitators of God, and Christ, as dear Children:
1 Cor. 6.19.20. Reu. 13.3.4.
who have Redeemed us from off the Earth, and from among the Children of Men:
yea, 1 Pet. 1.1^.
and from our vain conversation, received by tradition from our Fathers: (much
more from those vpstart, and newfound vanities, to which we are now
embondaged:) to this only end and purpose: John. 2 6. Romans 14.8. 2 Cor. 5 15.
1 These. 5.10.
that we should walk as Christ walked, live as he lived: living no longer to
our selves, or to our own Deceitful, Vain, and Sinful lusts, and Pleasures,
but unto Christ alone: 1 Pet. 2.21. 1 John. 2.6.
Christ Jesus is our only pattern, and example, and by him we are to
regulate, and square our lines^ and actions. Now Christ him^^lfe, (or any of
his:) did never teach us for to nourish Loue-lockes: they never left us, either

vanities: they are but Modern, and new-inu^nted Toys, and Vanities, with
which the Church, and Saints of God, in former ages were not at all acquainted.
Why then shall we who dare profess our selves to be the S^ruants, Followers,
Children, and Sons of Christ, and of his Church: addict our selves to these
vain, Lascivious, Licentious, Effeminate, and Unchristian guises of the World?

or Coultures of the World, which they have utterly renounced in their
Baptism? What Warrant, or Example, have they in the Scripture, to Adore,
Admire, or take up, these Ruffianly, Vain, and Foolish Trappings, Locks, and
Guises, which few, but the very scumme of men Appla^d, and Magnify? Alas,
whose steps, what patterns, do we follow in these newfangled vanities? Do
we imitate, and follow Christ: or such Honestissimum est, maio^um vestigia

Pious, and Religious Ancestors, which walk, as Jesus walked? Are they
Religious, Humble, Chaste, Discreet, or Holy men, who set and bend themselves to
serve the Lord, in sincerity, and truth of Heart? If so, then show me when,
and wh^re Christ Jesus, or any such as these, did ever nourish, or approo^e of
Loue-lockes, and then you may safely wear them. But if the persons we
imitate, are only Idle, Vain, Effeminate, Lascivious, Deboist,
Vainglorious, Proud, Fantastique, Singular, Ruffianly, or Ungodly wretches,
who have no power, nor truth of Grace within them: who make their will, and
fancy, the only rule by which they walk: (as I fear me, they will prove
all such at last.) If they are such a^ make no care, nor Conscience, of
following Christ, or such are not likely to bear us company in Heaven: let us
utterly renounce their Guise, and Fashion, and withdraw our feet from all
their ways: because the ^cchoing, and Non ^mitand^ nobis illi sunt, qui sub
Christi^no n^^ine Gentilem vitam agunt, and al^ud professione, aliud
conuersatione ^estantur. Hierom. Tom 1. Epist. 11. c. 2.
imitation of such (which is the principal, and primary end of wearing
Loue-lockes,) i^ merely Sinful, Unlawful, and Vnsee^^ly, unto Christians.

The second end, or ground, why many wear, and nourish Loue-lockes, is a
Proud, a Singular, Fantastique, and Vainglorious Humor: or a Desire, that
others should take notice of them, for Ruffians, Rorers, Fantastiques,
Humourists, Fashion-mongers, or for Effeminate, Lascivious, Voluptuous,
Singular, or Vainglorious persons, or men of Vicious, Riotous, and Licentious
lives. Many there are, who nourish them of purpose, to Proclaim, and blaze
abroad their Vanity, Rudnesse, and Deboistn^sse, to the World: that so Ga^d^t
l^^datis ire super^a comis. Proport Eleg. l. 2. El. 1.

the light and vulger sort, or censured by those of the more Religious, Wise,
and Grauer rank, as Dissolute, Ruffianly, Lic^ntious, Rude, Vainglorious,
and Fantastique persons, since they have nothing else to make them noted, or
known to the World. Now this very end, (which many of our Loue-locke owners
do intend,) must needs be odious, and abominable: because it is Isay 3.9.
Ier. 8.12. Phil. 3.19.
a glorying, and triumphing in those sins, and vices, which Ezra. 9.6. Job.
42.6. Ezech. 21.43. Luke 18.13.
should be their sorrow, grief, and shaeme: because it is a publishing, and
proclaiming of their sin, with impudence, and shamefulnesse, as Sodom did:
which is the very highest pitch, and strain of all iniquity; Ier 8.12.13
Isai. 3.9.10.
and will bring certain ruin, and Damnation to them at the last. The third
cause, or end, why many wear, or nourish Loue-lockes, is an over greedy desire
of satisfying the Leuitie, Vanity, and Fickleness, of their various, and
unstable Lusts and minds, which hurry, and post them on to every newfangled,
Fantastique, or Vainglorious guise. Now this being the ground, the cause, and
end, why must men nourish Love locks, must needs be Evil, Quid tam
bestiale, acquomod^ ^o^ ind^ce^s tibi voluntate pro l^ge vti, and qui^ no^ est
ad quem appelleris volunt^ vt^, negligere rationem? Non Mi^^^ deiecti quam
^l^ti animi est, v^ ^ut^ rationi^ expertem, non pro ratione sed pro libitu
agere, nec Iudic^^ vti, sed appetitu. Bern. de Considerat. l. 3. c. 4
Brutish, and Unseemly, because it savors of Lawless, and unruly
Wilfulness; which pampers the Vain, and Sinful humors, Lusts, and
dispositions of our carnal Hearts, which should be Romans 8.12.13. and 13.14.
Col. 3 5.
Mortified, Curbed, and Restrained. The fourth end, or ground, for which men
foster Loue-locke^ is the commemoration of some Mistress, Whore, or
Sweetheart, (as they style them,) as being a Character, or sure Testi^ony, of
their devoted service, and true affection to them: whence they were
denominated, and styled, Loue-lockes; because they are but Emblemes, and
significations of men's Love, to such Female, Amorous, and Lascivious creatures,
for w^ose sakes they did reserve, and cherish them at the first: Now this being
the original, chief^, and pro^er, end, of wearing Loue-lockes; it mak^s them
Odi^us, Sinful, and Abominable; because this and, and ground is such: For See
Argument 4.
who will not censure and condemn all such, for Vain, Effeminate, Lascivious,
Amorous, Unchaste, or Sensual persons; who dare to wear^, and nourish
Loue-lockes, against the Laws of God, and Nature: and the Mod^st, Dece^t,
Grave, and civil ^onsure, Cut, and Custom of their Country; of p^rpose for
to please, or Humor, a Vain, Fantastique, Light, or Worish Mistress, Dame,
or Sweete-heart? or to bequeath them at the last to some Impudent, Shameless,
or Vainglorious Harlot, (the Prou. 2.18.19. and 22.14.23.27.
only Gulf to swallow, and devour Souls without Redemption:) to wear them
like some Goodly, Rich, or Precious Jewels in their Ears, as an open Herald,
Badge, or Testimony, to proclaim those R^ciprocall, Amourous, Unchaste, and
Lustful affections, which they bea^e one to another, to their disgrace, and
sham^? D^eth this beseem a Christian, or a Child^ of God? are these things
tolerable in Carnal, Grave, or Civil; much more in Honest, Chaste, or Gracious
persons, Pudi^^tiae Christianae s^tis non est esse, verum et videri. Tertul. de
Cultu Fae^n, cap. 4.

whose very Culture, Hair, and Tonsure, should ma^ifest, and Proclaim their
Chastity unto the v^ew of others? Were there ever such patter^es, o^
pr^^id^nts as these, to be found in any age, in Chaste, or Mo^est men? ^n any of
Gods Saints, or Childr^n? or in the Church of God? Certainly, I never heard,
nor read as yet of any such, and I dare lay, no man else. Wherefore, let those
who nourish Loue-lockes for this end, (as many do,) and yet dare assume the
name, or face of Christians to themselves, Omne malum aut timore, aut pudore,
natura per^udit Tertul. Apolog adu Gent.
even blush, and hide their ^eads for s^ame, nay^ vex, affl^ct, and grieve
their Hearts, an^ Souls, at the very remembrance, and thoughts of this, and
all those other Vain, Lascivious, Odious, Scandal^us, Si^full, and Unchristian
ends, for which they wear, and cherish Loue-lockes; which convince the very
use, and wearing of them to be evil.

If any now object (as many do) in the defense, and justification of these
Unlovely, Vain, and foolish Haire^ jewels. That they are an Quod solum formae
decu^ est cecidere capilli, etc. Petroniu^ p^g. 8^ Turpis sine ^rondibus arbor,
and sine crine caput. Ovid. de A^te Ama^d. l. 3. See Apu^eius Metamorph. l. 2.
p, ^02, 103.
Ornament, Honour^ Beauty, Grace, and Credit to them, and hence only is it,
that they nourish them, without any other by respect.

I answer, that they are so far from being any Ornament, Beauty, Grace, or
Credit to such as own them, that they are the very Brands, and Badges of their
Infamy, and Shame: and that by the unerring verdict, both of God and Nature,
who expressly inform us: 1 Cor. 11.14
that if a man have long Hair, it is so far from being a Grace, or Ornament,
that it is a shame unto him: Coma ^aeminedecus, vir^ dedecus: Paulinus Epist.

with which the Fathers, and Sto^a^^ De Intemperantia Sermon. 6. Athaeneus
Dipnos. l. 12. c. 5.7, 9, 10.
others do concur. Who dares then be so impudently bold, or shamelessely
wicked, as to estimate, or repute that for an Ornament, Grace, or glory: which
God and Nature, together with the Fathers, and all Godly, Grave, and Holy men,
repute, and style a shame? Loue-lockes, and long Hair, beyond the Sober
Civil, Moderate, and Decent length, of the more Religious, Grave, and Sober
sort of men, are a very infamy, and shame to men; if Fathers, Christians, God,
or Nature, may be credited: therefore, they are not, they cannot, be an
Ornament, Beauty, Grace, or Credit to them; at least in the eyes of God, and
Holy men, (to whom they should endeauoure to approve themselves: what ever
they, or other Vain, or Graceless persons do pretend. But if men should
slight this Grave, and weighty Testimony, both of Fathers, God, and Nature, as
a mere untruth. I would demand this question of any Ruffian, or
Vainglorious Gallant, who vaunts, and triumphs, in the length, and
largeness of his Lock, and thinks himself much Honored, Beautified, and
Adorned by it: Whether that which every Page, or Foote-boy, every Groom, or
Coach-driuer, every loytering Rog^e, or Cheating Rooke: every R^gged, and
Raggamuffin Soldier: every Nasty, or strange-sented Fre^ch-man: every
Runnagado, Light-footed, or False-handed Irishman: or every Sorded, Base,
Deboi^t, and Rascal person wears: that which every Scullian, Peasant, Cobbler,
Tinker: nay, every Rogue, and Beggar, which post from Goal, to Goal, or Door,
to Door: that which every Man, or Woman in the World, may have as well as he:
can be any extraordinary Honor, Credit, Ornament, or Beauty to him?
Certainly, that which ever ordinary, Base, and Infamous Varlet wears: that
Vsu etiam praetios^ dege^erant, quoru^ ^utem difficili^ possessi^ eoru^ grat^
per^un^ti^. Ambr. De Elia and Ieiun. c 9.
which auery Man or Woman, is capable of, as well as any man; can be no
Ornament, Beauty, Grace, or Credit unto any. Hence was it, French History p.
7. See Caeliu^ Rhodig. An^iqu. Lect. lib. 15. c. 8.
that Clodion the hairy, King of France, desiring to be Respected, Honoured^
and Renouned for his long Hair; inacted a Law: that none but Kings, and their
Children, with the Princes of the Blood, should wear long Hair, in token of
command: which Law was long observed in France: Else, his long Hair had been
no special Ornament, nor Grace unto him, if every one might have worn it. Now
there is not the basest Peasant, Rogue, or Varlet in the World, but may wear
as Long, as Great, as Fair, and Rich a Lou^-locke, as the greatest Gallant, or
the proudest Ruffian: yea, we see that Foote-boyes, Lacquies, Coach-men,
Seruing-men, (yea, Rogues that ride to Tiburne, and the very ^roth, and sc^mme
of Men,) have taken up this Roguish guise, and Fashion, and have it most in
use, and admiration; and can these Locks then be any ornament, Grace, or
Credit, unto men of Place, of Birth, and Worth; since such vile, base, and
infamous persons wear, and take them up in use? and since there is none so
mean, so base, or poor, but may as well, and freely nourish, and reserve a
Loue-locke, as the very best, and proudest Gallant? Certainly, if Loue-lockes,
and long Hair, were such rich, and precious ornaments, or Beautiful, Jewels,
as our Sect of Loue-locke wearers deem them: then every Woman in the World,
(unless it be such Audacious, Impudent, Shameless, and Mannish Viragoes, who
1 Cor. 11.5.6.15.
clip, and cut their Hair, against the Laws of God, and Nature:) then all
those Barbarians, and Heathen Nations, who nourish all their Hair, and never
cut it till their deaths: yea, every Quid capillum ingenti diligentia comi^^

long-tailed Horse, the Hair of whose mane, and tail, are of a far longer and
larger sise, then the greatest Ruffians Loue-locke:) should be far more
Honorable, Generous and comely, then the most ouer-growne, Hairie, or
deboi^test Ruffian, who is most proud and hautie of his Loue-locke; because
they transcend him in the length of Hair. Since therefore Loue-lockes, and
long Hair, are common unto beasts, as well as men, since every Man, or Woman
may wear them if they please, as well as any: and since they are so ri^e and
frequent among the baser, looser, and deboister sort of men: I may infallibly
conclude; that they add no ornament, beauty, credit, grace, or luster unto
any, but infamy, deformity, shame, and disrespect, especially among the
better, grauer, and religious rank of Christians: which should cause all men
of worth and credit, for ever to discard them. Secondly, if men will wear
their Hair for ornament, and comeliness sake, let them nourish it of a
moderate, Ordinary, Civil, Grave, and decent length, which is the most Tu

was a mere mistake, and error in Lycurgus, who Plutarch. Lisander. and Lacon:
Institut. Arist. Rhet. l. 1. c. 9.

Zenophon Laced^m. Respub: Boemus de Mor. Gent. l. 3. c. 13.


taught the Lacede^onian young m^n to nourish their Hair at the full length,
because if they were Beautiful, it would make them more Amiable and comely: if
Deformed, more Terrible to their Enemies: For that ce^tainely, must be ^ost
Beautiful, and Co^ely, that is most sui^able to Nature, to the condition of
our Sex, the custo^e of our Country: and which d^eth most Adorn, Commend, and
Beautify us in the eyes of God, and of the Bes^, the Wisest, and Greatest part
of Men: Now short Hair, or Hair of a Moderate, Ordinary, Grave, and Decent
length, is most suitable, and proportionable to Nature, to the condition of our
Sex, and custom of our Country: (to all which long Hair is contrary and
aue^se,) and it does most Adorn, Commend, and Beautify us in the sight of
God, and of the Best, the Wisest, the Grauest, and greatest part of Men, who
approve it as the best and comeliest wear, both in their Judgments, and
their Practice; when as they Discant a te Coepiscopi tui c^matulos puero^ ^
comptos adolescentes secum non habere. Bern. de Consid l. 3. c. 6
condemn long Hair, and Loue-lockes, both in their Judgments, and their
Practice too, as Unnatural, Womannish, Hateful, and Vndec^nt vanities; which
more deforme Men, then adorn them: Crinium copiae vires mi^uit, and quasi e
corpore exugit. Philip. Louicerus Turcic. hist. l. 2. c 3.
as things which eneruate, and exh^ust their strength^ and Spirits: and make
them not more Ter^ible, but more Contemptible to their Enemie^: who often times
take advantage by their Hair to foil them, and to cut their throats,
Synesius. Calu^tii Encomium. Alex. ab Alex^ Gen: Dier. l. 5. c. 18. Plutarch.
Thesius. Polydor. Virg. De Invent. rerum. l. 3. c. 11.
as Histories do relate; Whence, the Abantes, the Macedonians, and others
whose Hair had been an occasion of their overthrow in War; were forced to
pole, and shave their heads before, least their Enemies should take advantage,
or holdfast by their Hair, and so put them to the worst, as they had done in
former times. Loue-lockes then, or excessive long Hair, are neither a Grace,
nor Ornament to the Beautiful, but rather a Deformity, Disgrace, and Shame:
they make men not more Terrible, but more Contemptible to their Enemies, who
will slight, and scorn them as Effeminate, Sloathfull, and Unmanly persons,
and take advantage by them: contrary, to that received maxim of Lycurgus:
(which Pag^ns may, Object. 2.
though Christians ought not to admire, Answ. 1.
because they have surer rule and pattern for to walk by:) so that this first
pretense is merely vain.

If any obi^ct in the second place; that they nourish, (yea, Frizle, Curle,
Color, Crispe, Adorn, and Frounce) their Hair, and Loue-lockes of purpose to
augment, or to set out their Beauty: that so they may appear more Amiable,
and Comely, both in their own, and others eyes: which end they hope is
Laudable, Good, and Justifiable.

I answer first; that this pretense is no ways warrantable: For if we Romans
5.8.
must not do evil in any kind, that so good may come of it: much less, may
we Curle, Die or ouer-curiously deck our Hair, or Loue-lockes, of purpose to
improoue, illustrate, or set out our Beauty; which in its very best

is but a brittle, momentany, fading, and inferior good. We all know, that the
acquiring, intending, and enhancing of comeliness, and external beauty, is
made the common ingredient; nay, the daily Apology, Patronage, Plea, and

stupendous metamorphosis: is it not from this Apology, Plea, and
Justification, that they do it only for Ornament, and Beauty sake? Now
because I am fallen upon this vile, and odious practice of our women, which is
now so much in use: I will give you an Historical list of sundry women in
former times, who have Polled their Heads, and cut their Hair upon sundry
grounds and reasons: but none of them out of Pride, or Fashion-following as our
Viragoes do. Some there were, who did cut their Hair by reason of some
Religious, Idolatrous, or Superstitious order, or profession, which they had
taken upon them. Witness, the Plin. Not. ^ist. l. 16. c. 44. Alex. ab Alex. l.

Vestall Virgins among the Romans; who upon their initiation into that
Superstitious, and retired Order, did shave their Heads, and hanged the Hair
shorn off as an holy thing, upon a Lote-tree near unto the Altar of the
Goddess Lucina; from whence it was called, Lotus capillata, or the Hairy
Lote-tree: Witness, Acosta. hist. Indiae l. 5. c. 15. Purchase Pilg. l. ^. cap.

should cut her Hair, under a supposed pretense of Piety, and Religion, which
God had given her for a natural veil, and for a remembrance of her
subjection, that she should be accursed, as an infringer of the precept of
subjection: Other women have cut their Hair in case of necessity, for the
defense, and safeguard of their Country: Strabo. ^eog. l. 17. Plutar. de Aere

any Country, which allows them for to cut it: so that this custom cannot

Indians, French, and T^nians, those who were guilty of the greatest crimes,

and heavy punishment of all others: Which testifies, that it is the most
infamous, unnatural, and shameful ^^ing, that can b^fall a woman, (not a
grace, or ornament,) to cut or clip her Hair. You have now heard a large
Historical Narration of women who have cut their Hair in whole, or part, for
sundry ends and purposes, against the very order, law, and rule of God, and
nature, which none can violate, or transgress, without apparent loss, and
hazard to their souls: But Nec vsquam inuenta est, aut inuenire potest, quae
nouaculae caput submiserit, praet^rquam in gr^ui aut inauspicato eue^tu: si
vllam vsquam eiusmodi tempus tulit, mihi certe neque auditu^, ^eque visum

never could I read, or hear of any, that were so strangely Impudent,
Immodest, Mannish, and Unnaturally wicked; as to clip and cut their Hair,
against the ordinance of God, and Nature, the light and testimony of their
own Consciences; the custom of their Country, and the opinion, and practice
of the Church, and Saints of God from age to age, of purpose to inhance,
illustrate, or set out their beauty; but only our audacious, brazen-faced,
shameless, (if not unchaste, and whorish,) English Hermophrodites, or Man-women
Monsters; whose prodigious, and blushlesse impudency, bids battle and defiance
unto Heaven it self, and dares the Lord to smite, or to control them:
Certainly, God himself has testified, 1 Cor. 10.5.6.15.
that it is an unnatural, vile, and shameless thing, for women to poll their
heads, or cut their Hair: therefore they may not clip, nor cut it as they do,
to set out their beauty, or rather to proclaim their shameless impudency, to
the public view. If they may not do it, out of a pretense of Religion, or
De^otion toward God: as the Council of Gangra has resolved; much less may
they use it out of Lasciviousness, Pride, Wantonness: or any affectation of
Comeliness, and Beauty. But to return again unto our purpose from whence we
have somewhat, (though not impertinently) digressed. As women may not clip
their Hair, (no nor Paint their Faces, nor wear immodest apparel, or
attires:) out of a pretense of comeliness, and beauty; no more ought men to
nourish, crispe, or frizell it, for this end and purpose. First, because it
savors of Effeminacie, and womanish inuirilitie: an odious, unnatural, and 1
Cor. 6.9.10 Gal. 5.19.21. Ephesians. 4.19. Romans 13.13. Isay 14.16.17

disparagement and shame to men; especially, to Christians, to be Effeminate
and womanish in any thing: much more in the ouer-curious, delicate, and

Hair, which sauoureth of nothing but Effeminacy. The Isay 3.24. 1 Timothy 2.9. 1

That no man should walk abroad with curled Hair under pain of

effeminacie: Capillis artificiosis and intortis crinibus incedere, perd^ti,

and ouer-curious dressing of the Hair, as an effeminate, womanish, and unmanly

must not use it to set out our Beauty, because it favors of effeminacie; a
sin which God, which Man, which Nature, do abhorre^ Secondly, as it
relisheth of effeminacy, and inuirilitie; so likewise, it tastes of Leuitie,
Vanity, Pride, Vaineglory, Impudency, Incontinency, Lasciviousness,

of God, and better things: as the Fathers, and others do abundantly testify:

Secondly, I answer; that man's perfect, true, and real Beauty, does not
consist in the Fair, Clear, or comely Superficies, Delicacy, and tenderness
of the Skin, or Face; nor yet in the curious, nice, and artificial
Embroyderies, Curlings, Textures, Colorings, Powdrings, or compositions of the
Hair, as most men vainly deem: but Qvi sanos habent ^culos solam animi
pulchritudine^ in homine diligunt and venerentur. Bern. de Ordine Vitae. c.

in the inward Endowments, Ornaments, Trappings, Virtues, and Graces of the
Mind, and Soul, in which the Excellency, Essence, and Happiness of men
consist: This is the only Comeliness, and Beauty, which makes us Amiable,
Beautiful, and Resplendent in the sight of God, of Men, and Angels: this is
the only culture, and 1 Samuel 16, 6, 7. Isay 57.15. and 62.1, 3, 4 Ps. 16.3.

only Beauty which Christ Jesus had on Earth, who had no outward form, or

and only Beauty, and Glory, which the Saints, and Church of God admire, and
partake of both here, and hereafter; though carnal men abhor and loath it as
the great^st deformity. If therefore we would be truly beautiful, and
lovely both with God, with Men, and Angels; if we would extend our Beauties,
and improoue them to the uttermost, so as Cant. 4, 9. T^liter pigmentatae Deu^
^abebit is amat^rem. Tert. de Cultu. F^em. c. 7

shine as Stars, and as the brightness of the firmament in Gods heavenly
Kingdom for evermore: This is a Beauty that Sickness, Time, and Age cannot
decay: this Beauty will stick by us, and continue with us for all eternity:
yea, it is such a comeliness as will Non deformitate corporis animus fo^datur,

all corporal, and external Beauty, is but mere deformity, where this is
absent: O then let us prise this Beauty most, without which we are deformed,
ugly, and unlovely in Gods sight, let us admire, seek, and purchase it with
greatest care: so shall we be abundantly beautiful, and every way amiable,
and comely, though we have no artificial trappings, nor external crispings,
cultures, or attires to adorn our Bodies, Heads, and Faces, or to enlarge our
external Beauty, which is not worth the seeking.

Thirdly, I answer; that Vnumquodque animal in suo genere ac specie
pulcherrimum est: quod si de altero in alterum tranferatur, nihil impeditius ad
vtilitatem, nihil deformius ad aspectum videri necesse est. Lactant. de Opific.
Dei cap. 7. Rectiora decentioraque sunt ^^nia quae vis and habitus naturae

every thing is most amiable, beautiful, and comely in that natural feature,
comeliness, and proportion, which God himself has stamped, and engraven on
it. Nothing is properly, and truly beautiful, and comely in it self, but
that whose Varnish, Gloss, and Beauty flows, and springs from God himself;
who is the only fountain, and spring of Beauty: All acquisite, external,
exotique, and artificial varnishes, cultures, dressings, and attires, which
any ways change, sophisticate, or alter that natural feature, form, and
comeliness, which the prudent, and unerring hand of God has wrought, and
formed in us: transforming us into another hue, or plight, then God has given
us: is so far from adding comeliness, or luster to us, that Propriam perdunt
pulchritudinem qui externam inducunt. Cle^. Alex. Paedag. l. 3. c. 2. Mulieres
si sunt pulchr^, sufficit naturae: non co^tendat ars contra naturam: Sin autem
sunt natura turpes, ex iis quae sibi applicant, quod non habent arguunt. Id.

it does more deturpate, and deforme us; ecclipsing, obfuscating, and
deprauing that natural, and lively Portraiture and Beauty, which the curious
Pencell of God himself has drawn, Limmed, and engraven on us. Hence was it,
Math. 6.28.29. See Chrysostom. Hom. 23. in Math.
that Solomon in all his glory, was not arrayed like one of the Lillies of the
Field: because their array, and Beauty was natural; His, but acquisite, and
artificial. If therefore we would be truly beautiful, let us content our
selves with that natural Beauty, Hair, and Feature, which God himself has
bequeathed to us, as being most suitable, and convenient for us. Doubtless, if
God had ever thought, that Crisped, Frounced, Powdered, or artificial,
acquisite, and embroidered Hair had been most for his glory, or for our
Beauty, Good, and Comeliness: See Clem. Alexan. Paedag. lib. 2. cap. 10. lib.
3. cap. 2, 3, 11. Ter^ul. de habitu Muliebri^ cap. 5. Decultu Faem. cap. 4.5.
Cypr. de Habitu Virgin: ac^ordingly.
himself would out of his infinite wisdom and goodness have assigned us
such natural Hair as this, which we affect and seek; else he could not have
been so Wise, so Good, so perfect, and exact a God, so exquisite, and skillful
a Creator as we all repute him. Since he therefore, being Wisdom, Goodness,
Knowledge, and Beauty it self has designed such natural, and vnadorned, or
vncrisped Hair unto us as is most comely, proper, and behoofull for us: Let us
not murmr, nor find fault with him, nor call his Art, his Wisdom, his
Goodness, and Discretion into question: Manus Deo inferunt, qua^^o illud quod
ille ^ormaeuit, re^ormare and transfigura^e contendunt: quia opus Dei est omne
quod nascitur; Diaboli quodcu^que mutatur. Quod ornari te put as, quod put as
comi, impugnatio est is it a diuini operi^, praeuaricati^ e^t veritatis: Et tute
impune existimas laturam tam improbae temeritatis audaciam, Dei artificis
offensam? Cypr. de hab Virg. In Dominum delinquunt qui cutem medicaminibus

reprehendunt artificem omnium. Repraehendunt enim cum emendant, cum adijciunt,
a Diab^lo artifice sumentes additamenta ista: qui indubit^te huiusmodi ingenia

est: Ergo quod fi^git^r Diabol^ negotium est. Diuino ^peri Satani ingenia

Let us not offer violence and force to him, in laboring to correct, to alter,
perfect, or amend his work; or to Nemo ducem sequitur naturam: Viuitur art.

new-moulde, or make our selves, as if we were more wise then ^ee: Matthew 5.36.
cap. 10.30. Luke 21.18.
But since we cannot make so much as one Hair white or black, when as God
who numbers all our Hairs, has given it another tincture, let us rest
contented with that lot and portion, with that natural Hair, and Comeliness
which God has given us, Nu^quid bruta mutant speciem suam? Cur nos mutare
desideramus? Ambros. Irenae^. Tom. 1. page 233. F. Clem. Alexand. Paedag. lib.
3. cap. 2.3.11.
as all other creatures do, who never seek to change their Hair or Plumes,
as men and women do: for fear we prove far worse the^ beasts, spurnning
against our wise and great Creator, and saying to him with those presumptuous
Pot-sheards in the Scripture: Isay 45.9. Romans 9.20.
why have thou made us thus? to the wrack and ruin of our souls. That
Beauti, Hair, and form, is best and comelie^^, which God, which Grace, and
Nature, (not children, loose and wanton persons) deem most beautiful and
comely: But God, and Grace, and Nature, deem our natural Beauty, Hair, and
feature best and comeliest: and none but Children, Licentious, Vain,
Lascivious, and graceless persons undervalue them, preferring these
artificial Curlings, Powdrings, Colorings, Embroiderings, and dres^ings of
the Head, the Hair, and Face before them. Therefore these natural must needs
be best and comeliest: If therefore we would be beautiful, and lo^ely in
good earnest, let us rest contented with Natures wa^d-robe, not adding art or
culture to it: for fear we offer violence unto God himself, and put the
Devils varnish on his work and Image.

Fourthly, I answer; that an Effeminate, Womanish, No^ e^t ornamentum virile
co^ci^^itas Seneca. Epist. 115. Vt ^orm^ cura non omnino negligenda, ita nimi^
anxie curari parum viro dignum. Eras. de Educa^. Puerorum, p. 23.
affected sprucenesse, or concinnitie, (especially, in Hair and excrements,
the lowest and most inferior parts, if parts of man,) is no Ornament, Grace,
nor Comeliness, but rather a deformity, and disrespect to men: as being
unsuitable to their Magnanimous, Masculine, and Heroicke sex. Fo^ma viros
neglect a decet. Ovid. de Art. Amandi. lib. 1. Pulchritudo neglect a magis qua^
affecta^a a viros exornat. Bernard. de Ordine Vitae. Col. 1116. G.
A neglected, natural, an unaffected Beauty, Face, and Comeliness, does
most adorn, commend, and set out men: The only means therefore for men to
enhance, illustrate, and set out their Beauty, is to neglect it, not to seek
it, at least but in a moderate, careless, remiss, and unaffected manner: so
that this pretense of seeking Beauty, is but false and vain.

Fifthly, though 1 Samuel 16.12. Job 42.15. Lam. 1.6.
natural Beauty be a gift of God, not wholly to be slighted, because Gratior
est pulchro veniens a corpore virtus. Virgil. AEnead. l. ^. S^n Epist. 66. See
B^rn. de Ordine vitae. Co. 1115.1116 accordingly.
it adds some luster to our Gifts, and Graces, being regulated and a^tended
with Chastity, Modesty, M^ekenesse, and Humility: No^ e^t p^lchritudo vera
quae vitiorum habeat de^o^mitatem: Ambros. l. 5. in Luke 6. Tom. 3. p. ^ 8. ^.
Pulchrum ornatum mali more speiu^ caeno collinunt. Nequicquam exor^ata est been
qua mo^ata est male. Plaut. Mostellaria. Act. 1. page 29.
as our vices (on the other side,) do stain obfuscate, and blemish both it,
and all external cultures, and attires else: yet a Studious, Curious,
Inordinate, and eager Affection of Beauty, (especially, by Effeminate, and
Unchristian Cultures, Fashions, and Attires,) must needs be Sin^ull, and
Abominable: yea, far worse then Drunkenness, and excess of Wine; if
E^riosum quidem esse and vinosum, etsi sint magna vitia, non tamen tanta,
quantum e^t nimium sui ornandi studium. Ib. Paedag. l. 3. c. 2.
Clemens Alexandrinus may be credited: and that for these ensuing reasons:
First, because See the Authors quoted Page 1. and 2. Non de integra conscientia
v^nit studium placendi per decorem, guem natura liter inuitatorem libidinis

it proceeds most commonly, from an Adulterous, Unchaste, an^ lastfull Heart,
or Meretricious, and Whorish affection: For if it be true of natural Beauty,

He, or she, can never be a chaste and undefiled virgin in the sight of God,
who desires to be amiable in the eyes of men: For though they do not always
actually prostitute their bodies to the lusts of others, as most that do
affect an accurate, excessive, or artificial Beauty, in Crisping and adorning
of their Hair and Faces do: yet since they inamor and inescate others, and
kindle a fire and flame of concupisence, and unchaste affections in the hearts
of many, who cast their eyes upon them, by these meretricious cultures, and
ouer-studious, and affected Countenances, Dressings, and Attires, which seem
to set their bodies out to sale; they cannot but be guilty of Quid (...)

wounds and scarres upon their faces, to make them more deformed, for fear
least others should be infatuated and ensnared with them: then any ways Curle,

others prejudice. See B.C.
Beauty is no help nor furtherance, but a great impediment unto chastity:
therefore this studious affectation of it, and inquiry after it, proceeds not
from a continent or chaste affection, but from a Lascivious, Lustful, and
Adulterous Heart: and so it cannot but be evil. Secondly, it must needs be
evil, because it flows as from an Effeminate, and Unchaste, so likewise from a
Proud, Vaineglorious, Carnal, Worldly, and selfe-seeking Spirit, which aims
not at Gods glory, nor at its own, or others good and welfare: There are none
who seek an artificial Comeliness, or transcendent Beauty, by altering,
Coloring, Crisping, or adorning of their Heads, or Hair, or by any such like
means, but do it out of an inward, and secret Fastus inest pulchris,
sequiturque superbia formam. Ovid. Fast. l. 1. Forma quotaquaeque superbit. ^d

Narcissus did of old, and many idle Christians now, who make their Hair, and
Face their Idols:) in their own Beauties, Skins, and Shadows: and to
Deifie, or Adore themselves, their Hair, their Heads, and Faces, like so many
petty Gods: Or else they do it to win respect and praise, from Carnal,
Graceless, and iniudicious persons, by seeming more Beautiful, and Lovely to
their sensual eyes, then in themselves they are. Or out of a In. hoc

to conform themselves unto the guise, and sinful customs of the World, and
Times, which Christians have renounced in their Baptism: or to pamper, humor,

which should be Mortified, and Crucified, with all the inordinate Lusts,
Affections, and Desires of it^ Or else they use it out a mere Fantastique,
Singular, and Vaineglorious Humor, as In his Character of a Phantastique.
Sir Thomas Ouerbury, has well observed: who makes this, the very Character of
a Phantastique, or improuident young Gallant: to study by the discretion of his
Barber, to Frizle like a Baboone: three such (says he,) would keep three of
the nimblest Barbers in the Town from weauing Net-garters: for when they have
to do with him, they have many Irons in the fire. These are the proper, true,
and only roots, the ends, and springs from which this search, this labor,
and iniquirie after Beauty, Fairness, or Complexion flows: these are the
maine and chiefest reasons, for which our Men, or Women Nouris^, Color,
Frizle, Powder, or set out their Hair: Now these are Sinful, Odious, and
Unlawful. Therefore we must not Nourish, Curle, Powder, Color, Embroider, or
set out our Hair, of purpose to Diuulge, Enhance, or blaze our Beauty, (which

consists in Grace, in Holiness, and in a well-spent Life, and not in Hair,
in Face, in Skin, or Superficies,) as this objection, or vain excuse
pretends: Gods glory, our own, and others real, true, and spiritual good,
should be the end, and aim of all our actions: Let us always eye, intend,
and mind this blessed end in all our ways; and then we shall not seek for
corporal, f^eeting, nor external Beauty, which betrays, and wrackes the
Souls of many, but brings no solid, true, nor real good to any.

You have heard and seen now Christian Readers, the birth and pedigree; the
beginning, growth, and end: together with the unlawfulness, vanity,
effeminacy, and indecency of Loue-lockes: You see how they thwart the Laws of
God, and Nature, and the Tonsure, Cut, and custom of our Country: you have
heard and read, what uncontrollable, and conuincing arguments have been
produced, to prove them to be Odious, Lascivious, Uncomely, and Unlawful,
Toys, and Vanities; which bring no glory at all to God, nor Ornament, Grace,
or good to Men in any kind: to be such infallible Characters of Leuitie,
Vanity, Lasciviousness, Pride, Effeminacy, and Vaineglory, as misbeseeme not
only Gracious, and holy Christians, but likewise the more Temperate, and
Civil sort of carnal Men: to be things of ill report among the Grauest,
Best, and Wisest rank of Christians, Non despiciat quid de se vnusquisque, and
maxim vir bonus sentiat. Nam negligere b^norum iudici^ vel arrogantiae, vel
dissolutionis est. Ambr. De. Officijs lib. 1. cap. 47.
whose judgments ought not to b^ slighted: You have h^ard and seen what the
Fathers, and Modern Authors have concluded of extraordinary long Hair, and so
of Loue-lockes; how they have passed a doom, and sentence of condemnation on
them: For of truth, De Sacerdoti^ Barbis. fol. 17.
says John Valerian, a great Clearke of Italy,) to nourish the bushes, or the
Hair, is the fashion of Women; or else of such men, as live delicately, and
unchaste: for the long Haired people were ever esteemed both of the Greeks, and
Latins for a token of foul lust, and filthy living: And for my own part, I
never heard as yet of any Laudable, Honest, Lawful, Just, or sound Apology,
or Justification, that might, or could be pleaded for them; but only these
absurd pretenses, which I have here refuted, and defeated. I beseech you
therefore by that homage, duty, and respect which you owe to God, and Nature;
and by that reverence and submission, which you yield unto the opinions and
judgments of the Fathers, and the Best, the Wisest, Grauest, Holiest, and most
judicious Christians: by that conformity, and regularitie, you owe unto the
Ancient, Laudable, and decent Habit, Fashion, Tonsure, Guise, and custom of
your own Country, and Nation, of whose Cut, and Tonsure, you See Mr. Perkins

ought not, you need not be ashamed: by the love and care you bear unto your
Names, and Credits, among the Best, and Wiser sort; and by the good, and
happiness you wish unto your Souls at last, which Loue-lockes will inuolue,
and merge in sin: by that sacred Vow, and Covenant, which you have solemnly
made to God, and Sealed, or Subscribed in your very Baptism: Even to forsake
the Devil and all his Works, the Pompes, and Vanities of this wicked World,
and all the sinful Lusts of the Flesh: (in all which these Loue-lockes have
their part, and share:) and by that Joy, and Heavenly consolation, which you
hope, and long for at your Deaths; when all the Powdring, Curling, Cost, and
Time, which you have vainly, and prodigally cast away upon your Hair, and
Loue-lockes, will prove but Gall, but Horror, Shame, yea, Anguish, Grief, and
Bitterness to your Souls: that you would now at last abandon, and utterly
renounce the nourishing, use, and wearing of these Lascivious, Singular,
Vaineglorious, Unnatural, and Unlovely Loue-Locke, (which God, and Nature,
which all Good, all Holy, Grave, and civil Men, both now, and heretofore; as
also the Use, and Ancient practice of our Country do condemn:) together with

Effeminate, and uncomely Loue-Lockes, and excessive Hair; together with all
false, or borrowed excrements, or artificial Crispings, wreathings,
Colorings, Powdrings, and ouer-curious Cultures, and Compositions of our

Authors have condemned:) that so we may with broken Hearts, and contrite
Spirits, unfeignedly abase our Souls before the Lord, to divert those Fatal,
Heavy, Sad, and doleful Judgments, which are now approaching toward us, and
even ready for to seize, and prey upon us for our many sins: whereof our
Pride, our Vanity, our Wantonness, and Effeminacy in Hair, and Apparel, are
not the least. If we refuse this counsel and advice, which the vicinitie, and

If we take more care and pains to adorn our Heads, and Faces, for the view
of others, then to prepare, and fit our Hearts, and Souls by Prayer, and
Meditation for God, and for his Ordinances; as alas, too many Idolatrous, and
selfe-seeking Christians do in these our days, who adore no other Deity, but
their Hair, their Heads, their Faces, Clothes, and borrowed Beauty: We have
then no other hope but this; that God will loathe our persons, and our Prayers
too: and Quo^to diutiu^ Deu^ n^^ expectat, vt ^mendam^^, tanto districtiu^

final ruin. Let this then, cause us to renounce, abhor and loathe these
Sinful, Odious, Unchristian, Lascivious, and unlovely Vanities.

BERNARDI. Meditationes, cap. 11.

Omnia quae ad vsum vitae accepimus, ad vsum culpae conuertimus: Quapropter
iustum est, vt qui in cunctis peccauimus, in cunctis feriamur.
