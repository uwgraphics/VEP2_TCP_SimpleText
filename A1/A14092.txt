Gospel.

Q. Can we come to the Kingdom of Heaven by the way of Gods Law?

A. Gal. 3. 21.
No.

Q. Why so?

A. Romans 8. 3.
Because we cannot do i^.

Q. Why can we not do it?

A. Ephesians. 2. 3 Ioh. 9. 34. (...)
Because we are all borne in sin.

Q. What is it to be borne in sin?

A. To be naturally Col. 1. 21
prone to evil, and ^^. ^3. 3.
untoward to that which is good.

Q. How comes it to pass that we are all borne in sin?

By reason of the sin of our first Father Adam.

By the Gospel.

glad Tidings of Salvation by Jesus Christ.

Q. To whom is this glad tidings brought: To the righteous?

A. No.

Q. Why so?

A. For two reasons.

Q. What is the first?

A. 1. Ioh. 1. 8
Because there is none that is righteous, 1. Kin. 8. 46.
and sins not. Iam. 3. 2.


Q. What is the other reason?

A. Mat. 9. 1^.
Because if we were righteous, that is, without sin; we should have no need
of Christ Jesus.

A. 1. Tim ^ 15.
To sinners.

Q. What, to all sinners?

A. 2 Cor. ^. 3.
No. Act 13. 40


Q. To whom then?

A. To such only as 1. Pet. ^ ^, 8.
believe and Romans 2. 9.
repent.

This is the first lesson to know the right way to the Kingdom of Heaven. And
this consists in knowing the difference between the Law and the Gospel.

Q. What does the Law require?

A. That Gal. 30 10.
we should be without sin.

Q. What does the Gospel require?

A. That we should Mat. 3. 6 1
confess our sins, Ioh. 1. 9

save sinners?

A. 1. Tim. (...).
In Gods word.

Q. Where else?

A. In Gods Sacraments.

Every Sacrament teaches us this lesson, as we shall easily perceive, if we
understand what a Sacrament is?

A. ^om. 4. (...).
A holy sign and seal of grace*

Q. How many Sacraments have you?

A. Two.

Q. Which are they?

A. Mat. 28. ^9.
Baptism, and Mat. 25. ^6.
the supper of the Lord.

Q. What is the sign in Baptism? 1. Cor. 11. 23*


A. The ^. Pet. 3. 2^.
cleansing of the childs face or body by washing it with water. ^. Cor. 6. 11.


Q. What is the grace signified?

cleansing of the childs soul from sin by 1. Ioh. 1. 7.
washing it with Christ's blood.

Q. Christ is in heaven, we are on earth: How can his blood wash our souls?

A. Romans 3. 25. and ^. 9.
By faith.

Q. Have children faith?

A. No; Romans 10. 17.
for faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.

Q. Why are they then baptized?

A. 1. Cor. 7. 14.
God accepts the faith of their parents. Genesis 17. 7.


Q. We are made clean from sin by baptism: But are we made without sin?

A. 1. Ioh 18
No.

Q. Why then are we said to be made clean from sin?

A. For two reasons.

Q. What is the first?

A. Gal. 3. 10. 13.
Because we are made free from the punishment o^ sin. 1. These. 2. 10.


Q. What is the punishment of ^inne?

A. Romans 6. 23.
Death.

Q. How are we made free from it? Genesis 2. 17


Q. Gal. 3. 13
Christ died for us.

Q. What is the other reason?

A. Romans 6. 6. 7. 12.
Because we are made free from the power of sin.

Q. What is it to be made free from the power of sin?

A. That sin shall Romans 6. 14.
not reign over us Romans 7. 17.
though it dwell in us.

Q. How do you know whether sin reigns over you or no?

A. By repentance.

If we repent sin does not 1. Tim. 2. 26.
reign over us, otherwise it does.

Q. What lesson does this sacrament teach us?

A. As truly as the water does 1. Pet 3. (...).
wash the child's face, 2. King. 5. 13.
and make it clean; so truly does the 1 Ioh. ^. ^.
blood of Christ wash our souls and make them clean.

. 3.
Q. What is the sign in the Lords Supper?

A. The Mat. 26, 26. 27.
eating of the bread, and drinking of the wine Ps. 104. 15.
to the nourishing of the body.

Q. What is the grace signified?

A. The eating of Christ's body, and drinking of Christ's blood to the nourishing
of our souls.

Q. Christ is in heaven, we are on earth; How can we eat his body and drink
his blood?

A. By faith.

So says our Savior, Ioh. 6. 35. He that comes to me shall never hunger; He
that believes in me shall never thirst. Therefore to bel^eue in him is to
drink him. And consider in reason.

Q. What is the hunger and thirst of a Christian, as a Christian?

A. An appetite after that which conserues the life of a Christian.

Q. What is that?

A, Ps. 4. 6. 7 and 32. 3, 4, 5.
The favor of God to the par^oning of our sins, and to the saving of our
souls.

Q. What is the next way to satisfy this hunger, and to quench this thirst?

A. Ioh. 6. 54 35.
To believe that Jesus Christ gave his body to be crucified, Ioh 4. 14.
and his blood to be shed for our sins.

Q. What lesson does this Sacrament teach us?

A. As truly as the bread that we eat, and the wine that we drink ^oth
nourish and comfort our bodies; Ioh. 6. 27. 33. 35.
so the body, and blood of Christ, if we eat and drink them Ioh. 6, 40
by faith, shall nourish our souls unto everlasting life.

Q. How many things are required to prepare us to the worthy receiving of the
Lords Supper?

A. Four things.

Q. What are the two first?

A. 1. Cor. 11. 28. 29.
Knowledge and Luke ^2. 19. 20.
faith.

Q. Where is that taught us?

A. In our Creed, and Catechism.

Q. What are the two last?

A. Luk 22. 11.
Repentance, 1. Cor. 11. 30. 31.
and Mat. ^. 23.
Love.

Q. Where is that taught us?

A. In the ten Commandments.

Q. Why is knowledge required to the Lords Supper, and not to Baptism?

A. Because baptism is the sacrament of our birth in Christ: the Lords supper
is the sacrament of our growth in Christ.

Q. What is this faith that is required?

A. Call. 2. 20
To believe that Jesus Christ gave his body to be crucified, and his blood to
be shed for our sins.

Q. Why is faith required?

A. Because well we may eat the bread, and drink the wine without faith: but
we Ioh. 6. 35.
cannot eat Christ's body, and drink his blood without faith.

True; for the eating of his body is a spiritual eating, and the drinking of
his blood is a spiritual drinking, consisting in meditation of the wonderful
love of God the Father, who, to save our souls, spared not his own Son: The
wonderful love of God the son, who to save our souls, spared not his own
self, but gave himself to suffer a shameful death, a bitter death, and an
accursed death for our sins: Ephesians. 3. 19. 18.
Here is the love of Christ that passes knowledge: such is the breadth and
length, and depth, and height of it, that we are not able sufficiently to
comprehend it.

And like as the body by feeding and drinking, does gather strength for the
better performance of all actions of nature: so the soul of a Christian by
meditation on this love of Christ in giving his body to be crucified, and his
blood to be shed for our sins, does gather more and more strength continually
for the better performance of all actions of grace; whether they be actions of
dependence, to depend upon him, and put our trust in him in all states, in all
conditions, even in the time of affliction, and persecution, and at the very
hou^e of death; Or whether they be actions of conformity to his will, in
obeying him, and walking in the ways of his holy commandments unto the end?

Q. Why is repentance required^

A. Gal. 5. 5. Luke 17. 47. 50.
Because faith is required.

For by faith we believe that Christ died for us.

Q. What ought we then to do for him?

A. To 1. Cor. 6. 20.
serve him all the days of our life: And since we cannot serve him by perfect
obedience; to serve him as we can, by true repentance.

Q. How many parts be there of repentance?

A. Four parts.

Q. What are the two first?

A. To Mar. 1. 5
confess our sins, and to be 2. Cor. 7 11.
sorry for them.

Q. What are the two last?

A. To Luke 18. (...).
pray to God to forgive them for Christ's sake, Mat. 3. 8
and to amend our lives: desiring God to give us grace that we may amend them.

Q. How many offices be there of love?

A. Three.

Q. What is the first?

A. To do our 1. Cor. 13 ^, 5, 6, 7.
neighbor no wrong.

Q. What is the second?

A. To do him good if we can.

Q. What is the third?

A. If he does us wrong to forgive him.

Q. Why must we have this love?

A. Ephesians. (...) 32.
Because we look that God for Christ's sake should forgi^e us.

as well as for our selves.

He does communicate himself in glorious manner to his Saints and Angels. Reu.
3. 2.


God is in all creatures as the author of nature, Act. 17. 28.
and communicating unto them the gifts of nature: God is in special manner in
his Church, as the author of grace, and Ez. 20. 12.
communicating unto them the gifts of grace: but in most special manner he is
in heaven, as the author of glory; and communicating the riches of his glory
unto the Angels and Saints.

Q. What is the second?

A. To teach us that when we pray, our affectious should be in heaven.

Q. Do you believe that God is your Father?

A. Yes.

Q. And what Father?

A. Mat. 6. 32
An heavenly Father.

That is the best Father: for Col. 3. 2.
heavenly things are better then earthly things, 2. Pet. 1. 19.
as the light of the sun is better then the light of a candle.

Q. What lesson does this teach us?

A. Therefore Luke 11 13.
he is willing to hear us.

This is the first part of the prayer, commonly called the Invocation: And it
conteines the profession of our Faith in God, both touching his goodness that
he is our Father, and therefore willing to hear us. And touching his power,
that he is King of all the world and therefore able to help us: without this
faith we cannot pray. Now follows the petition.

the want of this is the cause of all evil: And the knowledge of God is the
beginning of all goodness.

Q. To what end do we pray thus?

whereby we may be brought to the knowledge of him: 2. Cor. 2. 14.

so masters look to be served by their servants, so Princes look to be served
of their subjects. Yet the child is made after the image of God, as well as the
father: the servants as well as the master: the subjects as well as the Prince;
and therefore are able to understand of themselves what is fit to please their
parents, their masters, their Princes: But none of us is of himself able to
conceive what is pleasing to God: For my ways, are not your ways: neither are
