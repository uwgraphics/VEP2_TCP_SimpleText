A certain treatye most wyttely devised orygynally written in the spaynysshe,
lately Traducted in to French entytled, Lamant mal traicte de samye. And now
out of French in to English, dedicat to the right honorable lord Henry Earl
of Surrey, one of the knights of the most honorable order of the Gartier,
Son and heir apparaunt to the right high and myghtie prince Thomas duke of
Norfolk, high Treasorour, and Earl mershall of England.

To the right honorable lord Henry earl of Surrey. John^ Clerc, wysheth
contynuall health.
ALbeit this work (right honorable lord) is in the French entytled as
aforesaid, and only dysposeth of such light matyer of folysshe Love, as by a
long season reigned between Atnalt and Lucenda. Yet nevertheless thinking
assuredly your Lordshyp shall find that herein with per^^ce, the same shall
mysse in some others. And knowing by long experye^ce, not only the great
wysdom and synguler judgment ^^er ^^th God the dysposer of all things* has
most abundantly endowed you. But also the excedyng great pains and trauayles
sustained by your self in traductions as well out of the Laten, Italien as the
Spanyshe. and French, whereby your Lordshyp ^u^mou^teth many others, not only
in knowledge. but also in laud and co^mendacyon, like as I distrust not the
same, will rather prudently according to your accustomed fasshyon regard and
consider the wytty deuyse of the thing, the manner of Locucyons, the wise
sentences and the subtle and dyscret answers made on both parties, in my
power opinion not unworthy to be noted than otherwise without (...) ge the
same, wyllengly reic^^^ it. So I thought co^uenyent by these to sygnyfye that
in this traduction I have not estemyd the order of the words in ^ other
tongues, as it is seen some have done i so^dry places of their tra^slacions,
whereby it is not only thought they publysshe their own folly, but also
undoubtedly certain that they by the same in the place of liberty submyt
themselfes to seruy eu ^e without having res^^^^e to tho^seruacy^n of that
thing which in this case ^o most specially (...), whereby the sense of the
Aucthour is often deproued, and the grace ne perfection of tho^^ ^e other tongue
dewly expressed, but understanding that every tongue has his properties, manner
of Locucyons particular veheme^cies, dignyties, and rychesses, I have arrested
my self only upon the sentences and majesty's thereof so curyously as I fyrmely
trust thin^eucio^ of thauthor is truly expressed i ^ declaration whereof, like
as I humbly beseech your Lordshyp to take these my little labors and great
good will in acceptable yt and as ye monument of my power herty affection
always borne to the same So having most fyr^e confydence in your great bounty
I dystrust not the same, will take for satisfaction, not that I do but that I
desire*

The Auctour.


AFter that I had this somer passed en^prysed a voyage (more for ye necessyte
of another, than for my pleasure) for the accomplysshement, whereof it was
conuenyent for me to absent my self, far from this country / and had after
yt also conforma blie thereunto by a long time trauay led in the same. I came
by chance in to a great deserte no less solytarie of people, than displesaunt
to pass thorughe. And as this country was unknown to me. So thynkyng to go
ye right way, I strayed i^ such sort, as I could not eftsoon direct my
self, as well for ye great displeasur yt I had, as for the lack of some one, of
whom I might demand ye same, like as being in such necessytie / I knew y^ if
the pla te was abundau^t of solytude and desert that in me much more excedyd ye
passion. So than aduysynge all pertes suthe virtue had mine ^yes, as they gave
some comfort to my tormented heart when y^ in a forest far from me (being the
wether fair and clear) I had know ^^dge that in ye place (by some smoke, that
issued from thense) there was ha ^yta^ion of people, wherefore I thought it
best to travail thither. And albeit passing thorugh ye thyckenes of the wode,
I found the way so rude, and diffycyle as I repented me no less to have
enterprysed it, than I desired yt issue thereof. Yet nevertheless even as I had
begone it. So determined I ^^ot to surcease but to pass thorughe. And
pursewyng in my Jorney, as the ^onne begone to ^ouche I arrived on ^n high hyl
side, from whens I might easelye deserne the origynall place of the said
smokes, that issued from the house of a certain gentylma^, which ^he had newly
in yt place, caused to be edefyed, and was all painted with color black, from
ye foundacyon, unto the hygbest part of the same. Whereof I received such
marvel that as well to mu^e there of, as for ye desire that I had to repose me
I forgot all my pa^ sed trauayles, and approchyuge to the same, I was (by
chas^^e) very nyghe unto a place, where certain men did walk, who in their
countenaunces and apparel resembled to be replenysshed with great doloure and
heaviness, of the which, one (lykelye to be esteemed master and gouernoure
among them) walked before, who with heuye syghes passed ye time, yet neither
his color, ^^ lean vysage, had not alte ^yd his ge^tyll noryture and
educacyon.

[And albeit well he showed him self (aduysyng me being nere unto him) how
woche at ye first sight, he was there of estouned* yet neuerthelsse he dis
symuled it, and received me most genty^ ly, desiring me to dyscende, and come
a foot. After knowing my travail, he caused furniture to be made for my
repose, and took me by ye hand, to conduct me in to this his sorrowful house.
Than ^^ who of y^ strange place, received great marvel endeavored myself no
^sse* than I could, well so note ye syngularyties of the same, among the
which being aryued at the gate, I ^awe above it, three white rolls where ^^
was written.

This is the sorrowful house verament
Of one that dies, and does lament
Because death, to his death will not consent
WHen I had very intentyuely red them we passed further, and saw that all
things of that house, repre^ented grievous dolor. For from the ^oundacyon of
ye same unto the high ^st part thereof, other things appeared not but sorrow
and heaviness. Where ^ore I would not than demand the ^ause thereof, but reserved
it, unto a ty ^e more conuenyent.

^ From thense he brought me in to the halle where, without long^ tarry enge was
brought, the supp^t, wit^ great abundaunce of vitayles and goo^ order of
seruyse. *

Shortly after y^ sorrowful knight knowing the travail that I ha^ sustained,
brought me himself, in t^ a chamber where he left me, and ret^red with so
sorrowful a vysage, tha^ it was marvel. Than being alon^ I cast me in my
bed, but even as I thought to take repose / about the hour that the cocks by
their crow ynge, wytnessed the mydnight, I hade them of the house sing in
petiou^ mus^^que complayntes, wepynges, lame^tacions, mortal. Than (not you^
cause) more than before, I mer uayled, by thoccasyon whereof I was all together
depryued from sleep. But (as afterward I was aduertysed every night at that
hour, y^ sorrowful knight very eruellye tourmente^ himself, renewynge his
doloure an^ accustomed passion. Wherefore ^^ servants, seeing him in this marty
rye / love and pytie, obliged them to be (by sorrowful wepynges) conform un to
him that made doubt / who heryn ge such things, as no more suddenly taken
with trouble and vexacyon, than depryued of sleep and repose. So passed the
most part of the night, and the day made all to be put to silence. The son
rose even when I hard that in a church nere unto me it range to a mass, and
that the sorrowful knight came in to my chamber / who as he had done the day
before, to ke me by the hand, to go to here the deuyne service. Than being
aryued in his chapel I saw a monument coueryd with black, which (as I
perceived afterward) was the last lodging that he lokyd for himself, where
aboutes were graven such words.

^^holde w^ll he^^ the memory
Of one that lives in pain and smarte
For want of seeing presently^
Either him or her to ease his heart.
ANd albeit the mass were a celebratyng I left not for all that (during the
same) to note what the letters meant, and the sorrow that they showed, what
soever it was the things that I saw there, put me in great trouble, because I
could not therein establysshe a Just judgment / In going out of ye church, we
went to dinner, after the which the sorrowful knight, enforsynge himself, to
give me recreacion, moved me in diverse matyers / and demanded me of many
things among others he said, that the King and Queen he knew right well,
prayenge me to tell him, whether they were so tryu^pha^t lie accompanygned, as
heretofore he bad seen them, and as to their great excellency did appertain.
Wherein I could very well satysfye him. But than knew I right well that this
matyer was more to enterteyne me, thaune for any dey^^e that he had to know
any thing, because he was so sorrowful, that without ceasynge (ha uynge his
doloure present) did none other thing but sygh. And sometime between gyuyng
ear to my purpose sinyled. Than at the end, thanking me for yt good yt I had
done him, he began to say unto me. Know thou my friend that not without cause
I have induced the in these proposes the occasyon whereof, I will cause the to
understand, provided yt before, thon will give me gayge of thy faith, yt all
that I shall tell the thou shalt do it to understand and put it in the
puyssance of Ladies nolesse scauant tha^ dyscrete, to thentent that they
perceiving the same may know the ill y^ a woman has caused me to suffer
without reason, and against their common condycyon, which is estemyd more
pytefull, than that of the men / to the end that they being aduertysed thereof,
may blame her and lament her cruelty. Now my dames having at lengh conceived
his entencyon, and condescendyd ^accomphlysshe it, I have determined, for the
perfection of y^ condycions by him required to address unto you the work
following, which of right apperteyneth more unto you, than to others. And
because his matter was long, I thought good not only to redacte it in
writing / but also to send it you in this paper, Than after that the
sorrowful knight had received of me the surety that he demanded in this
so^te, he began his mat^er. *

The Knight to the Pilgrim.


ME thinks sir I should do the great wrong, if I should not declare unto y^,
the cause of the demand that ^ made the.

Understande thou that it is not lately that I know the King and the Queen,
their estate and magnyfycence. For their high renown and virtuous bounty is
in all places, abundauntlye publysshed. Nevertheless I thank y^ for the pain,
that thou have taken intellyng me that, which thou dyddest know therein. But for
another intent, I have induced the in to these several matiers, I trust to
make* y^ treasorer of my sorrowful passyones being assured, thou will have
pytie and receive doloure of my troble empressyng in thy memory that which I
will tell y^, to publysshe it hereafter.

THou shalt understand I was borne and norysshed at Thebes which heretofore,
Cadmus the sone of King Agenor did augment with people with whom I was long
nory^shed. My father long sithe is pas*sed this transytorie life, who was
named as my self. Arnalte, I leave to tell the more what he was, because y^
praise of him, whose sone I am, would ill sound in my mouth.

At that time y^ court of this King Cadmus, ordynarylye remained at Thebes*
wherefore also I my self was there contynually abiding, one day among others
(whenne my liberty was more fre from the passions of love) dyed one of the head
persons of the town, at whose obsequies, and funerels, all the courtisans,
and Citadins were present / and as the deed body was ^et in the mids of y^
church during the time of thaccustomed cerymonies, there was made by his ner^
ky^^esfolkes a great weeping and extreme doloure, specyallie by the daughter of
him that was deed, who shew^d her self so sorrowful, that without ^epose, she
had such a mortell war, between her hands and her here / as the most part
of the same, were plu^lred upon her shulders and cseuered in such sort as the
people that saw such cruelty, meruayled no less of the beaultie of the same,
than pytied of there so strange entraytement. None was there than that saw her,
that had not pyteouse compassyon of the doloure that this sorrowful maiden
suffered. Helas she of whom I speak is named Lucenda, For her becam I sorrowful
abashed and ferefull, abashed of her so great beaultie, and fereful doubting
her desperacyon.

Now after that ye deed body was committed to his last lodging, and that
Luce^da returned to her house, I took y^ way to mine seeking ye solytarynes to
accompanye my new thoughts, thynkyng by that mean, to find ease and
comfort to mine ill / But it was in vain. For I knew incontinent / I was no
less solytarye and haba^doned of hope, than of people and pleasure.

It happened yt many days so passed / wherein albeit I endeuered to forget my
delyveryd purpose, knowing well if at the beginning I found a thorney way,
yt much more sharp should be thyssue thereof. Yet nevertheless the more ye time
passed, the more mine ill, under dissymulacion approached and like as my dolor
did augme^t so my remedy decreassed I was i^ a strange necessytie. Than need
(thynuerter of all things) gave me counseyll, that by my payge (who often
frequentyd y^ house of Lucenda, taccompanye her brother) I might make her
know my passion, by thoccasyon whereof, I wylled he should hante yet more often
with the other, than he had done before / which he did right sadlye and
dylygentlye for my remedy in such sort, as being in nothing suspected, he
went when he would to the lodging of Luceda. Wherefore after yt many times I had
showed him to be the secret offering him diverse chaste mentes, if he were
contrary I gave him a letter containing this that follows.

RAther would I Luce^da yt thou knew my faith, than thou did y^ reding
of my letter, for if it so were in seeing me, thou should easylye know the
passion that I bear, being the same, none other but such as might well,
purchaise me yt which I trust to gain by writing to the. For that only by
my letter, thou shall understand my sorofull proposes, but by my tears, thou
should se my desperate life. So that my great dolor would supplye my little
understanding, and make the certain of that whereof thou may now douit For
though the ylles (such as I feel them) can not be declared, yet thy Judgeme^t
should give the very faith of them by my passyo^, nevertheless as well as I
possible may, I will make the to understand them.

Kuowe Lu^dena, that the self same day that thy father was put in the earth,
mine affectyon, and thy great beaulte made me all thine, if yt thou than dydest
return to thy house, and endyd to weep his death, I enteryd in to mine to
begin to lament of the ill that thou haste done me, Which I pray yt to believe,
For that I have no less feebleness to vanquisshe me, Than thou have force to
constrayne me, And further I assure the, That more for the wekenes to resyste,
Than of great will, I am gcuyn to be thine, For if it were in my power, I
woldeste the And I seek the, Thou baste so much domination upon me, And I in
me so little liberty, That when I have wylled not to love the, I could not,
Because my heavy heart, is* By my constauncy, and thy good graces) joined to the.

I aduertyse the that if it had been possible, I had rayther absented me from
the, Than in any thing to trust to y^, But if by predestinacion, I were
condemned to be thine, I have not had the power to eschew y^ ill of this good
otherwise it can not be. Deny me not tha^ thy good grace for by the greatness of
mine yil, I have well me ^y^ed it seeing that in so little time, thou haste so
dysmesurely ault ^ayged me.

Consider in what Obligacio^ thou art bound again to me. That more would
esteem my Perdycyon for the, than my Salvation without thine occacyon,

And further that sythen thou art the cause of my tormente. This travail is
to me pleasure, And my destruccyon vyctorye. Yet would I not despere me of this
beginning. But mine affection I declayre unto the* whereof albeit at this time
I ask the no recompense, yet trust I that hereafter thou shall know the state
where in I live. And that where as shall be the knowledge, reason shall not fail,
if there be reason the same can not be without recompense. *

So with such trust will I never despere. But sythe^ I am much more dysposed
to feel my pain. Than to do maunde the remedy, I will end this matter, to
fynysshe my letter. And with an humble request I pray the, that thou wit^afe to
s^ me To thend y^ my vysage may be wy^^enes to the of my dolor.

SO ended my letter, but before I gave it to the Page, I enstructed him in what
sort he should proceed wisely to chose the place* And the time co^uenyent to
the^ecutyon.

And albeit that pe^case Lucenda would not receive it yet nevertheless he should
leave it there.

Now were my commandments, and thobedy^^^e of my Payge confer mable in such
sort as for my conten tacyon he made such extreme diligence as one day among
other when he saw Luce^da alone he found mean to approach to her, And the
most secretly he could, Desired her to wytsaufe to take that which I wrote
to her. But she seeing her self importuned could not so dyssymule that she
gave not knowledge by mut^cyon of coulor how much she thought the matter
strange. *

This notwithstanding my payge (as well aduysed) consydering my torment,
^^^onned himself of nothing.

Where upon it happened that she seeing her self more and more constryued,
thynckyng to read her self of him. Departed with great dysplea sure, from the
place where she satte wherefore my payge, seeing her to go went dylygently
before, and cast my letter to her i^ such a place, as necessite forced her
will, to take it up howbeit the taking there of was such as she tare it in a
thousand peses, whereof afterward I was aduertysed which was a recharge and
augmentacyon to my dolours. For seeing my little hope and feeling, my
dysmesured torment. I trusted no comfort, but with the death. For this cause I
found me somoche enemy to my self, and friend to the pain, that more tha^
before I wylled to have recours to my sorrowful thoughts, with the which a very
long time I passed my days unto y^ one, Mourning my Payge (who careful and
dylygent was of mine affayre) came taduertyse me, y^ Lucenda had determined the
night following to go to matyns, which I casely believed for it was Chrystmas
yeuen. Wherefore to give some repose to my heart, I determined to dress me in
manner of a damoysell, whereby I might the more easily approach to her

Trusting by y^ mean, to avoid all danger* So with such habyt co^ferme to
he^^, I went to put my self Joynynge to the place, where she had accustomed to
be in such festes. And not suspectynge this to be de^epte, at her arryuall she
saluted me. Than thobs^urite of y^ night* the place, and the lack of company,
favored me so much, yt I had ameane to say to her.

Lucenda.




HA Lucenda, if I had so much wit, to complain me of the, as thou haste
power to cause me to lament, I should be no less wise than thou art fair.
Therefore I dysyer the, not to regard that, which I shall say to the. But the
passion of my heart, and thabundau^ce of my syghes which now I put to the, to
be wyttenes of my martyrie. I know not what gain thou doste trust of my
loss. ^e what good of my ill, I have written to the, that I am all thine, And
thou with great dyspyte have torn my letter in pecys. It should have suffised the
to have done y^ like to my life by thy great beaultie. Thou ought to have
permitted him to do his messayge. Tha^ by the same thou had known in how
many passions I have lived sith I saw the. Persevere not (I pray the) in such
an oultrageous purpose for it should to much endoma ge thy renoume, and destroy
my health. Where would thou search an excuse ^ayllable to serve the in this
strange fation of doing, Thou understand the pains with the which my tongue
demau^deth the remedy. And know how much the virtue and rigor are
dyfferent in condicyon. And that thou can not be ^ert^ouse, unless thou be
gentle and gratiouse. Sythen than that thou with so little, as with thine only
word, can satysfye and recompense my seruises, deny me it not. For I desire
no great benifite of y^, than y^ thy consent may call me thy servant. Seeing
that with the glory to be thine, The ill yt I have received by the shall be
satysfyed

But thou causest me much to mar uayle, sythen that for so little a thing thou
consentest so long to be importuned. Se that my syghes make the know already
that my little resyste^ce (seeing the rude assault and battle that thou
gy^est) is so ill edyfyed, as the same is more ready sone to fall the to keep
the fortress of my life.

And if thou thyncke that to speak with me (fearing to dystayne or fyle thy
honor.) it were to the to much enterprysed. Beware thou be not deceived
therein, For thou should receive more blame to cause me to dye, Than
faithfully to remedy me,

Will not than Lucenda to purchayse the name of an homicide. Ne will not I pray
the, for so little price to lose a servant, and seruyces so affectioned. I can
not tell what more to say, to make the certain of mine ill. For I am borne not to
a certain, but to be acertayned having more lernyd to lament me, tha^ to
find remedy. And because that my will and thine excellencye have no measure I
will not with long matter molest the. Let it suffyce the to se with thine eye,
that if thou dyffer me of hope short shall be my life And having not as endyd my
purpos with a trembely^ge voice, she began to answer me.

THou thynkeste well Arnalle by thine affected proposes to vanquesshe the force
of my virtue, But if it so be thou abusest thy self, For thou ought to
know that I have no less trust to my own defense than thou haste in thy
great persuasyons. Therefore I counsel the to surcease from such thy demand,
sythen that thou may well knew that thou shall do right wisely in y^ same. And
to the end that thou be more assured, like as thou oughtes to believe, that there
is no force in the world, that can break the port of my determined purpos, So
thou may see, y^ thou shall put the out of great labor cessynge from such
request. And where I have at this time, wylled ta^swere the, That has only
ben to thintente that having of my self none assurance, thou trust not any
recompense. For in such case the trust by her condycyon prolongeth more than
she satysfieth, So thou see that in this behalf the dyspayre comforts, and
the contrary (by a certain mean (weryeth and strayneth. *

And where in my words I show not the, the rygor that I should, that is
so^what to satysfy thy faith which I know, I will not deny y^, but thou love
me, sythen y^ thou sercheste me, more than I would, So of theys trauayles, thou
shall be ill rewarded, For I tell the that so large shall be y^ trust as thy
demand is to me importuned. And because it may be, thou shalt think that
for asmoche as my words are pleasant, my works shall not be rygorouse, by
cause I will not deceive the, I tell the that oneles thou altogythers turn
thine oultragyouse affectyon, and peruerte thordr^ thereof, I will put it in
thand of such one, as shall well complain and revenge him self of the,
Therefore it is my desire that without delay thou go out of this strife, For
thou see it is better quyckely to heal, than by a long season give mean to
death. Whereof I have wylled taduertyse y^ because that for the I have more
danger than remedy, Therefore approve my counsel, and to thentente thou say
not that by words I have abused the, I tell the what great ill shall turn to
the thereof, which I little regard. Than from hensforthe thou oughteste to put
thy desires in repos and live in pease, which I believe thou wylt do, seeing
that according to that thy tears and affection show me, it shall be more
agreeable to the to give me pleasure, than the contrary, For if thou do
otherwise I will have that faith doubtful which thou publysshest certain, and
shall cause to the damage, and to me displeasure, Now to thentent that from
hensforth thy purposes be so much dyseret as thy syghes wytnes y^ amourous, I
will no more teach, thethe way that thou ought to keep to do the pleasure.

SO friend such answer of Lucenda was all a greable to my torment, and in
such sort absent from my remedy, that by so much as the trust failed me, my
desire augmented, For seeing the grace of her speech e^riched with such
knowledge I felt me not to have in me any part alive out of my memory which was
inte^tife to se if afterward any good would dyscouer it self, notynge all y^
she told me, But in puttyng an end to her thretenings she endyd her speech
leuynge my recompense behind to put before the danger, wherefore the cause yt
least I feared was y^ death which wyllinge to make her tunderstande alytell
after I sang one night before her lodging this song.

if mine ill shall never achyeue
And my great pain shall never lie
How might one better know my gryeue
Than by my lyef, without to dye.
if to loss is turned my gain
And my torment so dis^^^^^ed
Ought I not of death to be feign
Syn^ that lyef thereby is opened.
if thou refuse me to relyeue
And wylt that still to the I cry
How might one better know my grye^e
Than by my lyef, without to dye.
THe singyng of this heavy Song might per^ase empeache the sleep of Lucenda, But
my playntes and anguysshes could not atall awake her spyryte, wherefore seeing
me altogether destytute of recompense like as than my do^our more augmented so
my pa^^o^ more af^ebled it self, And as y^ hope was than molested, it was
necessary also that the eyes by thoccasion of tears blinded them self in
such sort as by contumelyes / wepynges / and torments. I becam pale and
dysfygured and that more is so, desperate that against my self I began to say

O Ever Unfortunate the Edyfyce of trauayll what may now become of the in what
place art thou arrived, halt thou yet any trust See thou not that it is
impossyble for the to receive health of the ill, that thou have, and that
clearly the signs present make the know thy perdyo^o^ to come because that
thine eyes or the ladde^s of thy faith are situat in so high a place, that
thou ought fonner trust to ^alle than to mount. Thou shall be he that shall
have more ill, For thou were he y^ least of good ought to presume. *

O es^^a^^^ of thy self that art so weary of life, and not of desire, Alas
how great was thine infortunye in brynging the forth I se that by little and
little thouendyst and that thy de sire at the end shall vanquisshe y^, Have thou
not than great reason to wyshe the death, if for the wealth of the heart thou
desire it, yet thou ought to refuse it to exchew y^ perdicio^ of thy
soul. Now know I not what to chose, what to say, ne what to* demand. O my
sperite so dessolate, why haste thou choysen an habitacion so sorrowful. And
thou mine eye* the mortal enemy of my sorrowful heart, have I deserved that
thou shuldest^ so submyt y^ to the deceipteful laws of love Thou knew not
that the recompe^ses of him are vayn, when the seruyses are most great and
mass^fe. And yet thou knew right well that in y^ order of true love if the
lyef fall not, the torments are ever at y^ ^ot^. Thou knewyst well thy
feebleness, wherefore would thou than submyt the under so strong an hand. But
thou may answer me that thou have had so little power to dysobey him at the
first as now to forget him, which is all the ill yt I se therein. O thou
unhappy than, that the more puysau^ce lackyth the, the more thy playnt again
renforceth it self. And where by thy deeds thou thoughteste to enryche thy
memory, thou haste now less mean to do it, whereof thou shalt receive the
more shame being thine honor affe^ did and thy lyefe in danger, For according
to this recompense thou haste more occasyon to co^mplayn the, than to allow the
of any well doing.

Than sythen it is so take pacyence in paymente of the war that thou haste be
gone, and in ye same suffer the strokes yt thou trusteste which hereafter
shall be sharp for the, but as yet easy and light, howbeit tendure them to
the end the lyef and vndrestandyng will war werye, and if by that thou ease not
thy self have recouers to reason, weep thy solytarynes and hold the gates
open to death, For when thou shalt not think thereof thou shall find that
remedy which the understanding and reason shall deny the.

Arnalte to the Auctoure.
Many other things aparte I told my self which to thentent not to moleste
the, I will at this time co^myte so syle^ce, But being so far alyenat from my
self I began to row the galle of my passions, and yet being there to^rmented
of so great anguyshe cold I not attayn the port of repose, wherefore with somache
trouble I put in oblivion all mine accusto myd pleasures, without more to goo
but very seldom or little with the king, or elsewhere. And forasmoche as my
fre^des did co^tenually inquire of mine estate I determeni^ one euynynge to go
to y^ palais, where so sone as the king had perceived me after he had asked me
of my health, he commanded me to be at a torney which certain Jentylmen of the
^ourte had enterprysed, And albeit I was than more dysposed to solytarynes than
to great assemble. Yet to obbey him I determined to force my will, tellyng him
that sythen he had co^mandyd me I was ready to do it whereupon he made me
tunderstande in what sort it should be and the day that every one should be
redye.

Now the time appointed being come wherein it was necessary texetute
tha^^ayres by effect I desired the king he would cau^se to command the
ladies of the City to be as well at the mo^merye at night, as at the tornay in
y^ day, whereunto he was agreeable.

So was I assured that Lucenda would not be left be hynde. Wherefore great
trybulacyon suddenly inuadyd mine heavy heart and mine anguyshes were than meddled
with exceeding great and soubdayne motions, So that in one instau^t I was so
joyful as I was wont to be melancolique. The tyltes erected and prepared and
the assaillau^t^ beginning to put them upon thee ranks I came to pass before
the escaffaulte of the Queen making ^^y horse to flynge and prau^ce, Than by
chance through the sight of my ^rmet I saw Lucenda, ba las howemuche agreeable
to me was this pleasant adventure, Nevertheless for y^ busynes wherein I was
occupied the best that I could I dyssimuled it and to make y^ ^understand what
was the tokyn that I bare it was a pair of balaunces with the^ weyghtes the one
of them was grene and the other black the grene was high and the black very low
and written abowte.

The little that my trust does pease
Shows clery how much heuye
To my suffrance still without ease.
Bycause^ the night approached the ^orney endid wherefore y^ men of arms went
to dyfa^^he them and the king with the ladies retired them to the palais,
After the hour come to mask the maskers entered in to the hall, some took
them to dance some to common with he^ y^ he woolde ch^wse, But alas I
sorrowful put me more to complain of my mysfortune than before seeing me so
power of the good that was to me ne^ssarye, and so rich in part^rbacion and
syghes yet I assured my self and came raddresse me to Lu^enda dowting
nevertheless more to be refused of her than otherwise that not withstanding I
desired her to (...) whereunto she had not wyllynglye agreed if the custom had
not forced her, So she rose and put me ^urth her hand, alas who could
express the Joye and the ill that I felt than together. For my dolours to
much augmented them selfs seeing my benifete so nere, and my remedy so far
absent, thapparell that I ware witnessyd it right well, For I had that day a
Cloak brodered wherein was written.

Doulefull he is as he that dies*
And yet the death does him not streke
But more and more still him he flies
which he most pensif, ^othe to seek.
WHen the dawnce was en did Luce^da, retired her so nere^^ queen y^ it was not
possible for me y^ I cold hold her purpos without to be understand of others,
wherefore I determined to god to make a letter and cause her to understand by
writing that which I could not than tell her by mouth, Than I with drew me
in to a gardrobe, but so soon as I had the pen and the paper in my hand, I
felt the passions of the mind ^^pproche me by the mean whereof with exceeding
great pain I endyd my letter, which I foldyd short and narowe and returning
toward Lurenda I put it secretlye within the fold or tuckynge up of her
gown, neue^theles I could not so hamsomlye do it y^ she parceyued it not but
for y^ presence of the Queen she was constrained to dyssymule it, And the
letter conteynyd that which I will tell the

LUce^da if the mean were so well geuyn me to remedy my self as I have
occasyon to write to y^ without doubt I could esteem me much more content
than sorrowful or dyspleasant, Nevertheless y^ power and the knowledge to be
thine have al togethers refused me, and put me in great solytarines, desperynge
of the any remedy I have somuche said and written that I know not what more
to tell the, Somu^he is there y^ if thou retard and dyfferre my hope shortly
shall end my purposes and my life. Alas thou should know the y^ whereof I
plain me rather by my we pyng, than by my words, because ^ syns the anguis^hes
are greuouse the eyes vsyage their office do supply the defalt of the tongue.

O sorrowful, being in the state that I am, what may I do for so much more as
my faith has vinacitie somuche more my recompense is in ^lepynge, if to put
peace in my life thou thynkyst to make war to thyn honor I desyer not that
thou do it nether y^ thou speak to me, sethen thou art not agreeable thereunto,
but only y^ thou vouchesaulfe to look upon me seeing that by this only
benefit all y^ ill shall be forgeuyn the that ever thou ^yddest me I pray the
will not to be so mortal an enemy to me, for if thou have desire y^ I dye I
have yet the greater desire little to live by this mean without great brount we
both may be content, nevertheless consider that if by thyn occasto^ I dye thymfa
mye of thy mishape shall slowly leave the, and shall purchase such renown
that eternally mention shall be made of thy crueltye and of mine end, But if thou
wylt follow reason thou shall think that it is y^ done to give pain where
there is none offense, if thou think not that the same is tobbey y^ or the
desire that I have to serve the in this case thou shall be enough assoy led, and
I only worthy of tormente for recompense now sithen that according to that
thou have told me thou beleuest that I love the, read my letter and in redynge
it remember the ill y^ I feel being assured that if my trauayles be rep^ese^yd
to the thou will have more repentance than occasion to continewe, of one thing
I marvel much, what moves the to wylt rather to be cruel than to be served,
if thou mesure the passion that thou geuyst me with the service that thou mast
receive of me, I am sewre thou wylt know that thou have not occasyon to praise
the of the gain of my loss, And to end my letter I pray the that it may be
the last, for the presence can wytnes that whereof y^ paper can not give
knowledge. So will thou to se me or else the little desire that I have more to
live will set forth my death desired.

AFter that mi letter was committed to y^ pour of Luce^da for the desire that
I had to know how she used it, mine eye went not from her in any wise, But
nothing parceyued I, which held me in some repos, nevertheless the susspition
that I had gave me no trust and so was alienat from my self that I answe^^^
him y^ entretened me more in a boy^^ tremblas^t than to his purpose. Alas he
that than had put his hand to my heart had easly known a little the pa^ges
amou^eous that tormented it till the hour approached that every one retired him
self, than was I more dysposed to receive the trauayll than the repose. And
albeit I after y^ Lucenda had gottyn license of the Queen followed her man
habbyt dysguysed not only unto the port of her lodgyng but also unto within her
chamber to se the sentence that she would give unto my letter, yet nevertheless
at any time during the space that I there tarried I saw not her hold any paper
wherefore so without other certan^ie I returned, but the love (that never
slepeth) would not parmit me y^ night any little while to repose by the mean
whereof I determined to send erly in the morning my page to the lodgyng of
Lucenda to se in all the places of y^ house how preuey so ever they were and
specially where the donge and fylthes were wont to be cast whether he could
find any pieces of my letter. Than y^ page did his devour but he had no news
thereof which gave me some little trust, But yet not such as could diminysshe
this mine accustomed heaviness. *

So the more I went forward the more my remedy in such sort tarried behind
as I could not so well dyssym^e mine ill that it was not dyscouered by the
smokes of my syghes and thymbrasment of my heart, For the more my torment
augmentyd it self, y^ more that power diminysshed whereof easily my passion was
known And therefore I becam solitarye without more to goo out of my lodging,
whereof a suster of mine called Bel^ss^ who bare me love so natural that she
was participaunt with me in a great part of mine ill receued so much troble
that on a day as we co^mened togethers after diverse purposes she pryade me
with great abund^u^^^ ^^ tears to make her tunderstande the cause of my dolor.
*

Than having compassyon of her weeping I was enforced to declare unto her that
which I endeuered to ^epe secret. Nevertheless before that I did it cessynge
her lame^^acyon she began to say to me.

HElas mi brother for gods sake I pray the y^ hou will not hyde from me y^
cause of thy do^or for ever when I have asked it of the, thou haste found me
many dissymulatro^s, Consider therefore y^ if thou wylt deny me the verite the
love y^ I bear y^ shall meddle it self with my plaint, Thou say thou art my
debt or and that if I love the thou wylt recompense me again with asmoch of thy
part, But thou dostpublyshe y^ with thy word^s which with thy works thou
de^i^s^ Thou know well that such dyss^^ulatyons ought to be excused
toward me, Therefore I pray y^ make my heart secretary^ of thy passions. To
whom ought thou to g^ue such things in keeping, but only t^ me seyuge
that thou haste good assurance that if thou wylt the death I desire not the
lyef, if thou abhor the pleasure y^ displeasure is to me agreeable, if thou
love the travail the repose to me is dypleasunt. So y^ thine yiles and my
torment do po^yshe one selfsame heart, if than thou have determined to put thy
pain in repose with whom can thou better do it than with her who never is
weary to desire thy benyfyte for if thou wyl^e dyscharge it, thou and I to
gethers may bear it, if thou have desire that we w^pe, never let us do other
thing if thou wylt that in thine ill we comfort us let it so be do^ne, if thou
wylt that it cover it self thou and I, better tha^ thou alone can do it, if
thou wylt that the remedy do give mean, thou of thy side and I of mine may
easlye find it sh^we not I pray the so little amyti^ to her that has no
thing but is thine. And believe that thy dyssymulatio^ has no power to
vanquishe my Judgeme^t, For thy sighs right well do manifest that which thou
endeuerest to cover, Consider thou y^ by reason less ought not to be y^ love
than the fraternitye, And that most agreeable shall be to me y^ death if thou by
the same may receive the more ^oye use life, seeing that I se the in the
state over much to suffer and long tend^ure. But call again the ^perites and
regard y^ fortune is of the prosperus enemy, and of the myserables the most
great hope, So sythen that ver condycion is mouable and inconstant, yea and
such, as the most happy ought not to rejoice of her favor, thou ought not
than in any wise to dispay^e the of her ^eueuole^ce, for she con^u^^eth always
new accide^tes to folks hertes, to then^e y^ necessyte have* not knowledge of
her power. Therefore reserve not to the alone y^ solytarines dyspleasant in thy
displesures, Thou know well that ye most sorrowful does comfort him self /
wha^ his passyo^ is communicate to his friend, for the recreatio^ of the word
does demynishe the dolor of y^ mind. So than if the keys of my consayll may
open any remedy, wherefore refusest thou them, takyst thou pleasure so to think
day and night in thy pains losenge so much time, to speak to thy self
alone. Believe me I know y^ in the, greater is the ill that thou couerest than
that which thou manyfestest, but how soever it be the danger is greater to
cover it, than to disclose it, Specyallye to me who berith the more Amyte in
the mind than the mouth can tell. Now fearing to be displeasa^t, I will no
more Importune the of my request, but now end this matter dyspleasant which
endyd. Desiring to give my suster some contentacyon, I made her this answer*

THou holdeste me (madame my suster) so passyoned for thy passion, that I must
of force declare to the that which my demonstrations show the, And that more
for thine importunytye than for the will y^ I have thereof. For y^ if I had not
se^e thy weeping unfeigned thou haddeste never known of me this true answer,
nevertheless before thou know any thing I pray the y^ sythen that my tongue
shall reuele the mine ill, that for y^ same will not to pain the. For my lyef
shall end before the beginning thereof take end.

Thou shall understand than (my suller) that more by an estrange force than by
my propre will, I am constrained to submit me to the laws of love Whereby my
fortune has made me so great in obeisa^ce as lyttel in repose And more yet in
suffrynge, For in the mids of my sorrowful espryte all mine ylles have
assieged me, and yet of such sort hold me assiged, that for all the
resystance that I can do my good against the ill by mines in myneng, nether by
ladders in mowntynge, can not attain ye victory. For that the love defends
it self rudely against my fortune, which does assaylle so slowlye yt if I
have no soccor by the death, late otherwise shall I recover it.

Therefore (suster) I pray the pain not thyselfe for my dyspleasure but rather
rejoice the that thou have such a brother as can by the force of his virtue
endure so much ill. And if thou ever desire me to do any thing for the cause
that I se no more thys^ thy teres to water thy fair vysage, for if by weeping
I cold help me, mine alone without help of thine should warrant me.

Than sythen y^ for them the passion augmentith, and the ill dem^nisheth not,
it is much better to refrayn the^, and to remove thoccasyon to empire my
torment. According to y^ which thou have told me, thou closest y^ port of my
consell and openest it not to my will, We a^ ^or^e, thou to live in Joye, and I
in sorrow in this world For y^ pleasures that for me I woold choice I remyt to
the, for that only to the they are justly d^we, and to me apperteynith the
possession of displeasures ^ trauayles, seeing that I can manly better suffer
them than thou and considering that in the there is to little lodgyng to lodge
such adversities. Therefore I pray the be co^te^^ that we live, thou in Joye,
and I in sorow^. And if otherwise thou do, I will believe that thou wylt not me
the good that thou say, sythen y^ thou knowyst that it is my will, and y^
thou see, that thy tormente doubleth my passion, learn than no more to sorrow
for the torment that I endeure, other wise I shall have more travail feeling
the more to travail.

THis Purpose endyd my suster seeing that otherwise I did not satisfy her
request determined without more to importune me tenquyre by subtel means ye
cause and original, whereof proceeded my very great ylles. And as theffectes a
more ous do present to the Judgemement of men dyscrete the passions of the time
to come. So infynite sorrows and dyspleasures made me ordynarye co^peny
wherefore after that my suster was retired I gave place more than before to mine
accustomid dolor. Helas who could nombre the quantytye of my passions, if it
be not he that has exthewyd like fortune, what anguishe, what playntes, gave
than knowledge to my tormentyd heart, of her great power, during y^ which I was
without any repose weryeng without cessyng my varyable memory to the sownde of
my thoughts. And as I aryued to the point of my desperation, it came to my
rome^brance that albeit I had here tofore declared to a gentylman companyon and
friend part of the love that I bare to Luce^da, and that he himself had
endeavored somewhat to taste it also, by thoccasyo^ whereof I spoke not sy^s to him
of the same for seeing the danger that might ha^ thereof and knowing also
right well y^ in such affairs if the silence be not of commendacyon / he that
is in the pursewte puts himself in total perdycyon, seeing that the only
secret is the crown of ye lover, yet never the les omitting all these doubts
behynd I concludyd again to dyscouer to him (of whom I speak to the) all my
affections, trustyng that he would have petye, and would besaythful, also that
which harded me to do it was for that he was next neighbor to Luce^^a whom I
might se if I were loged in the house of my friend.

Therefore I sent to pray him to come to see me, which he did at his
aryuall, I told him the cawse wherefore I sent for him, And y^ trust that I had
in him, wherefore he thankyd me affectuouslye. And so much as at the first he
assayed to dystracte me from this love, so much he showed me vysage to find
it good, and to soccor me by thoccasio^ whereof. The more to move him to take
compassyon of me I said to him. *

My faithful friend yerso if now I show ye and present before the yt which
hitherto I have dylygenly kept in silence, The cause thereof is, the trust that
I have of thy great virtue. And thou ought not to find ill y^ long delay
that I have made therein, For thou knowist right well how much in amoreus
affection the splen^^ is esteemed, and the dysclosure worthy great reproach by
y^ mean, whereof I was in great confusyon nevertheless thy bo^tye has put an end
to all this doubts. So that thereby I have felt my pain wekyned, than sythen
it is so, where should I know better to lodge my secret tha^ between thy hands
seeing that thy virtue, and the love, that thou bear me, shall be confome to
keep it well. Now Brother and ^r^nde I aduertyse the that against the death
and the life I have sustained by a long time.

The assault of a breche much dimynysshed, with the death, for ye she will not
have me, and with ye life for that the greuyth me. Which assault so crewell I
began when the father of Lucenda dyed, which was the day that first I saw
her, and unto this present has contynewyd without knowing any mean to peace me
tr^uce in the same. For love seeing me so submytted to his commandments has
wounded me with all his power by his pa^ges enpoysonid in suhe sort as he,
being his fight rude, and my force weke, has brought me even to amortall
end. So contynewell have been his assaults, and my defense of so little
effect. That by this occasion y^ folks of whom I was wont to aid me have
betrayed me, leaving me sole, retyrenge them selfs into other places. And
that wors is, the trust does leave me, the remedy flies me, The reason hydeth
it self, and the socoure hurts me, so that by necessety forced I must yield
me into y^ hands of crewell death, And if thou think y^ in telling y^ this I
am alyenat of spyryte. Believe yerso that it should be to me a great benyfyte
not to have any judgment, For having not knowledge of my great losses, I
should not ^e^ey^^ for them any sorrow, for that being of understanding and
judgment de pryued, (...) should neither trust to have (...) ^^ (...), ^e ^et
have fear of ill. ^^ So (...) not trusting for any thing ^ sh^^o^ not despere
of my soccor, and of (...), as I do at this time present Therefore de^e friend
seeing me such, as thou see me, I have not knowyn more whereof to fortyfie me,
than by the force of thy amyte, and the arms of thy consayll, and to help me
therein I have thought that sethen thy lodgyng is so ^ere to y^ same of Luce^da,
and that other good I can not have thereof, tha^ to see her that at y^ least I
may be ^f so little athing satysfied, which is the cause y^ I have send to
seek the* To the end that after y^ thou have know in my torment, thou soccour me
as much as thou can and as I trust of the, and as the amyte which knowith
it self in y^, necessite will and ente^deth saying yt now thou art come in time
to do it. And for because I believe y^ thou would have more desire thereof,
than I have to demand it I, will no more imporune y^ of the same.

The answer of yerso, to Arnalte.
Friend Arnalte I plain me to the, and of the for the doubt end dystruste that
thou have had of me and with greater reason that the^ ought not by so long
time to dyssymule thine ill toward me, though it were so that by the laws of
true love, it was otherwise ordeynyd.

But they that be so secret, lose com mo^ly by holding their peace, y^ which
they should obtain without doubt, declarynge it.

Now Arnalte suffice y^, that more shall our in me the ill, that I have to
see y^ ill to suff^e. Tha^ the discourse of my complaynt to lament the, for y^
which greuyth the, dysplesith me, so y^ I can not comprehend it in my memory,
aduertysyng thy surely that if thy torment might part it self in two, I woolde
take wyllyngly the greatest part thereof, But to the will I remit that which
with y^ work I can not execute.

Thou say that the beaultye of Lucenda destroys thy life, of one only
occasyon, thy care and mine proceed, for if she cause the to have passyo^, she
falls mine health. Nevertheless to thentent that dyuersyte know not it self
in thy will and mine, I will fro^hensforth forget to think so, geuyng the
sewerty to do the pleasure to put peace in my wars. Albeit greuouse pain it
is to me, which thou being in the state y^ thou art haste no mean to know,
and the less thank shall thou can me to do this, yet nevertheless as well to
render me fre, as to leave the in the seruytude y^ thou desire I will do it,
to assewre so much my lybertye, as I have of dystrust of her recompense. And
so by my wtorawynge I shall be free, and thou shall rest in y^ puysa^ce of her.
Thou prayest me also to give the consaylt, and receive thy playntes if my
consayle could pro^^et the so much as thine ill has power to cause me to
lament, thou should tarry without any pain. But to tell the that which I
think thereof, I maruaylle how thou have wylled to consent that the force of
thy virtue is vanquysshed by a thing of so little pryse, And that thou y^ was
va^quer or of things more dangerous, now art by a woman vanquysshed,
Remember the how much is dyspraysed the renown, which re^drith it self
infamyd, by such infamye. And as far as I can parceyue thine espyryte
unbinds thy faith, and thy reason leauyth ye, in such sort as thou thyselfe
to thy power doste endomage thine own lyberty. Avoid thou such abuses, and
resyst manly such extremyte of love, not that I would consayle the that thou
altogyther absent thyselfe, But that thou esteem it, fear, search, and refuse
it, for there is no less danger to much to avoid love, than to much tobeye
to him, so that with a mean thou ought to moderate thy self, and by
apparences to deceive him, sythen he himself in effect is a deceyuour, and
that his law is such as he that least louyth, has most recompense and
proffyte, Me thinks thou would him good, and y^ thou say the to be his,
being not so dismesuredly despered. But beware the to trust all in him,
Consider that the co^dicyon of the trust in things more easy, shewith less y^
way. And for this cause thou ought not to despair, sythen that thou knowyst
his manner of doing, and the goodness that commyth thereof, Regard that fortune
geuyth end to things variable, So if she have been cause of thy dolor, she may
in time be grieved of thine ill, and rejoice thy life. And if thou will take my
consayle, thou shall se that thou shall obtayn y^ which thou art now assured
to lose, in coming to my lodgyng, which at all times that it shall please the
thou may dyspose, as of any thing of thine own, Thou haste do^ne me great
wrong, that so long time thou haste dyfferred it / seeing that I am so much
thine, y^ I would obey the as my master and co^panyon And because that from
he^sforth I will more pain me to remedy the, than to molest the, with long
matter I will hold my pease. To thentent in the rest temploy me in that which
thou shall command, And fromhensforth let us god wether it shall please the.

Arnalte to the Pilgrim.


Thou haste little understand (master my friend) thanswere that (yerso) made
me. But wha^ he playned him self of Lucenda. I assure the that suspycyon and
Ja^ousye gave me a new torment, never theles I made no semblaunt thereof, for I
thought it was the abundance of love y^ nory^shed me in such fa^tasy And in
deed sometime I had dystruste in him. And a little after I considered with
myself, as well that which he promised me, as also remembered our old amyte,
that never had wylled to do me sh^ewde turn, and thervppon seeing that he had
offered me so ly^^rally his lodgyng, I went thither wh^^ I made no long
demoure, before that I found myself dece^uyd of mine enterprise, For
notwithstondynge all the watch or pain that I took du^^nge the time y^ I was
there, I could not se her, for whom I was there lodgyd, so augmentd my torment
and in so many diverse sorts showed it self that many people had knowledge of
the same, and ymagyned thereof in diverse sorts, by mean whereof my suster
Belisa of whom I have told the already, considering my pain to come, and
seeing my dau^ ger present, employed all her industry to know the cause of my
sorrow, and so much did that by her importunytyes she might feel that Luce^da
was only thoccasyon of my great anguysshes. Therefore without to cause me any
thing tunderstonde thereof, she changed her accustomed fa^^o^ to live, and
peyned herself to frequent Luce^da more oftener than she had done albeit they
had before great socialitie together now hapened it y^ in one after dinner as
they to were retired to take repose my suster open ned to her such a matter,

Belysa to Lucenda.


I Pray the Lucenda that in vsyng thine accostomyd wisdom will not to blame
me, for that which I will tell ye. For if thou co^pr^hende well mine entention
I trust to be rather praised, tha^ for my words worthy of reprehensyon, for
that the doloure of another yt causyth my boldness, shall honor my shame.

Now than Lucenda, understand my saying, and thou shall know that there is a
long time, that Arnalt my brother cressyd in doloure, and decressed in health,
of such sort as all remedies to him ar contrary, which knowing, and also
seeing, his life to be short, for this ill so extreme, many times in wepynges,
and tears, I have desired him to dyscouer me his passions that, caused him the
death. But always he wylled to keep them secret, whereof I have had reason
greatly to lament me. So by subtle means, with the conjecture, the suspycyon,
and tokyn, yt I could know therein. I have been certain that thou only were
thoccasyon of his ill, and art the remedy of his life. Whereby I have
determined to lose me in telling ye, that which I do to remedy him. And to
give faith to my ma^ier, demand not any other proof, than the playnte that I
make to the of him. For if I had not seen his life in danger thou had not
knowyn my boldness, and ^emerytye, nevertheless I have so much desire to sau^^e
him, yt somuche as mine ill does dystour^e me from this request, somuche his
ill conductyth, and constraynith me to it, Because that the amyte which I bear
him is so great as for this occasyon I have made my selfse an enemy to mine
honor, and by a stronger reason to put my life for his it should be little in
respect of this And so I ought to do as well for my solyc^tude as for his. For
thou know est that by the pestelence passyd our father and mother have left
us sole and if thou wylt now dystroye the reast of our lineage thou shall be
more worthy of r^prehension than of great praise, S^ynge that I can assure the
that if thou deny him y^ remedye^^^ only death shall put pease in his life, and
thou shall be by this mean ex^pt from the trouble that he geuyth the and he
exempt to be more tormentyd, regard in what oblygacyon thou art dound to him,
that ye more thou desdaynest him, Somuche y^ more he louyth and seeks the. And
somuche the more as thou causest his perdition somuche the more he estemith
this be (...) lo^^e, to be by the desired such, Than sythen that so strange
torment seems to him repose, and that y^ knowledge of thy crewell condycion is
takyn away from every one, thou art ^wyse bound to him, because that fea ring
yt thine honor be not troubled for his occasyo^ be fayneth his dolor in
pleasure, which to him is a most peasant burden, for that such pleasures a^
enemies to his desires, that which more ^oroweth him is to show by necessytey
^ysaige contrary to his will. Therefore consent not that such fydely^e peryshe
for so little occasyon, and by so great ingratytude, if thou do verily I can
assure the that thine oblyuyon, and his co^stancye shall make an end of him,
and if thou have power to break the bataylle of his passions by only to write
to him, I pray the deny him not this, benyfyte and do him such grace for my
sake, if thou wylt not do it for him. Thus doing in the place of a friend, as
thou haste of Belysa from ^^sforth thou shall have of he^ an esclaue, Suffyce
the that there is two years that I have leuyd in dy^nge. Take away than from me
this passion sp^h^ that thou only mayst^ chase it away.

The answer of Luc^da* ^o Belysa.


Dear friend belisa I pray the put from y^, the doubt that thou haste to
receive blame, for that which thou have said. For thou ha^^ not put thine
honor in somuche parell, that it may in any thing be defiled, knowing verily

know well* how much the honor of da^mes does demynishe it self, when to
soccour their lovers* they forget them selfs, Require me not than, to do that
which thou thyselfe would not acco^plysre, knowyst thou not in what obscuryte
should be my virtue, if to the desire of thy Brother. I should give light.
Would to god, that of so grave and sad a thing, thou would not importune
me. For by experyence thou shouldyst be certain of ye trouble that I have of
his torment.

Haa how many times have I takyn to displeasure the^^i^a^io^ he had of my
beaultye, sythen it has caused him so much myshap. Helas how many times
being alone, have I wept his wepynges, specially when I considered yt he
thinks a thing so impossyble. Believe me yt I have more desire to give him
remedy, tha^ thou to seek it. And if for other pryse, than for ye honor I
might do it, I would be so redye* to give it ^y^^, as he to receive it.

But sythen that his g^yn can not be without my loss, he ought to content him
of the will, that I have toward him, which I pray y^ cause him tunderstand,
and the ill that I have, for the ill yt he suffers, which thou may
assuredly wytnes to him. And if in mine answer thou find not that which thou
sekest therein, put yt fault and blame in mine honor and not in me. For if
without toffend my renown* I could soccoure thy brother, verily I woolde do
it for the dolor that I have of his. Therefore I pray yt Belysa not to co^^eyue
any dyspleasure toward me hereof, seeing that I have deserved it in nowyse. And
because that long spekyng and little doing is ^^s^ trynge to a parson
required I will leave this matter without longer to declare.

The Auctoure.
A Little after, returned my su^^er toward me, who to ^^ioyce me, declared
yt she came from the sight of Lucenda, but she told me not thanswer that she
made her, for wisely she thought to cause me to think good, that which had been refused to her. Nevertheless she could not so parswade me, yt I would give
faith ther^^^to, or content my self so that I saw not any thing yt would
bring Assurance of that, whereof she thought to dysguyse me. And also (...)
lacks, the saying is (...) doubtful, by y^ mean whereof thinking very well
that my sustes (...) (...) of her enterprise, desper^^ of all mean I
determened to fay^^ that I cared not for Lucenda, and ^^ forget her I was
advertised that she (...) caryd for my tormente ^^tho^^ to have any compassyon,
and in de^^ I did ^^^t ^^iche I had enterprysed (...) (...) my suster to cause
her tu^^ derstand that herafter I would pey^^ my self little to travail for
her, and to learn to be from hensforth mine own, without to alyenat my
lyberty into ye hands of a parson so ingrate, which my suster promised me to
do* Nevertheless before that she went thither I desired her to take heed to the
contenau^ce y^ Lucenda would keep when she should show her this message, for
that better by her gesture than by her words she might have know ledge of her
will. And above all things that she notyd well if she would change color. For
by ye vysage (commonly) is knowyn the thought of the heart, And also yt when
she should cease her speech she should mark well if Lucenda would hold her
peace, or make ^emblance little to care thereof. And if than she would answer
to the purpose, or without thinking thereon or in words ill assured, For that
scarsly may such things be dyssimuled, wha^ they are governed by passions.
Than after that my suster who intierly understood my will, had written in her
spyrite, and logid in her memory, that which I had told her, she departed to
goo to se Lucenda, and after fyndyng her in a place co^ueuie^t, said unto her.

Belysa to Lucenda.
LUcenda if my request do cause y^ so much dyspleasure as it renders me
ashamed, I maruayle how thou can ^oke upon me. Never theles it is necessary
that the ylles of this thy captife my brother give the dyspleasures, and that
mine importunity to the be dyspleasant, this not withstanding I constrained
by the love that I bear him trusting (always) in thy virtue, have been bold
tappere before the with his lame^tatyons, which I require the tunderstande,
and suffer sythen yt I my self (without them) can not endure. Know Lucenda that
albeit my brother is determined to refuse the bondage, that thy grace has
joined to his heart, yet the same is nailed so fyrmely, that notwithstandyngd yt
he would do it, he fyndeth it impossyble, nevertheless he says he will assaye to
do it, and will abandone ye contrary making his absence mediatrice between thy
slaughter and his death, thinking by this banyshement to find yt which thy
presence does deny him.

But if thou consent to such a thing and that by y^ he execute his thought, I
assure the I shall live little after him, and thou shall give me y^ death.
Helas what batylmentes thou buyldyst, seeing y^ without long taryeng thou
fallest both his life and mine, for that if he absente himself, it is
impossyble that he live, neither that I being sole dye not. So I shall be to ye
somuche out of fauore as I were thy mortal enemy, Surely thou take more
pain to resemble piteouse than thou art, handlyng so ill ye faithful
vinacitie of him that would ye more good than any other living would desire to
ye. And yet was there never seen so dear recompense for so lyberall an
oblygacyon, Wylt thou have his will hole, puttyng his life in pieces. I pray
the for the love of me, establysshe new laws to thy delyberacio^ Not that I
will that by ye same thou break those, of thine accustomed virtue. But if thou
do that, which I will tell the, thou shall love and pray^e thy self, which
is that with a very little mean thou shall restore two lyties, in two parsones
deed. Deny not than this benyfyte, sythen that by no thing in ye same thine
honor shall be molested. Consider what shall come of my brother if he absent him
self, and what on shall I remain in his absence, have respect also to his
pardicion, and forget not my solitarines.

Helas remember the of his doloure and my pain, for gods sake, than be not so
intier in thine opinion, But do the contrary without defylynge thy renown,
whereby thou shall be served and I conforted, render not the culpable of his
dystruccion* and of my torment. Endeavor to forget y^ remembrance of thy will,
and think y^ all things governed by y^ same, como^ly come more to
repe^tau^ce than to gayn or profyt seek not more, to be ennemy of mine
importunities and be content to write to him, to the^tent he die not Being yet
in the mydest of his life. For it is a work most damnable there to give pain
where there is none offense. *

The answer of Luce^da, to Belysa.
BElisa I pray the to leave this weeping / And moderate thy passions, for from
hensforthe I will that which pleases the, Therefore rejoice the, would to god
y^ now I had no tongue, for that without yt same I should not speak a word
so far absent from reason, but because I have said it, let the fault thereof
be now extincte, and yet have I ben to quycke to believe thy counsel, but I
had no power to choice, So y^ I cannot say I was by thy force forced, and by
my will vanquyshed. And sythen that thou have takyn the blame of this fault
upon the, think (at the least) to yield me innocent thereof without to
gloryfye the of that thou can do with me, for by thy tears thou haste had the
wepons with ye which mine ancient purpose has been va^quisshed Nevertheless I
have pleasure of my dyspleasure seeing thy comfort and repose. And because I
have somuche loved and affectyoned ye, that I desire my loss for thy gain. I
pray ye that at the least thou recognyse toward me somuche benefyt, as thou
have had of sportnuitie tobtayne y^ which thou shall have, putting not
herafter to contempt this pryse y^ thou haste obtey ned of me, for it is holden
for a rule general, that y^ things whereunto one can not attain, ar much
esteemed, But after they are once put in his possession they are holde^ for little
and vilipended. Take heed than how from this day forth thou art bownde again
to me, and y^ the recompense thereof be not put in oblyuyon day of thy life.
Consider how from hensforthe I open and lose the bond of my renown, which
never came to woman of my lynage, and that worse is if by that which I have
told the I be before by y^ which I shall do I shall remain fallen for that
this beginning shall never take end, I will than (sythe^it is so) write to
him, and give him amarke upon me, by such condycion, nenertheles y^* my lettre
shall put pease in his contynuall wars, And if he purpose to de mau^de again
he shall percyue ye loss of yt which he has recovered. Helas that it were
the pleasure of god, that when I received in my heart this determynacyon ye
yerth had swallowed me for ever. For ye dolor is not heavy, that passyth
quyckely, and also with the death might finishe, that which remains
i^mortall in my soul, but the spyryte shall suffer it, sythen y^ by petye he
has made so strange an enterprise against him self, and albeit Belysa I
repent already of that which I have granted the. Yet neurtheles it is
impossyble that I can reuoque me from it because that thou from hensforth
should convert thy pain in to pleasure, I will than give place to thy
request, and to the end thou se what I will write to him, I go here to begin.

The letter of Lucenda to Arnalte.
I Believe Arnalte that my letter shall find the (when thou shall receive it)
no less pleasant than (...) agreed, my suster and I came at son rysynge in
to a church of relygyon, after. I retired me within a little selle where it was
accustomed to here confessions, nete whereunto came Luce^da to sit a little after,
by ye mean whereof seeing her in the place to understand that which I would
tell her, I began to her such a matt^er.

ALas Lucenda the grace that it may please the now to extend to me is such,
that if my power were not greatter or that this benyfyte were less, it should
be impossible for me by any mean to satyffye it if my pain were not taken of
y^ in co^p tie of seruyces, And to make the to un derstande yt thou ought to
receive it, my face so desolate and thy faincte works ar suffycyent, and that
wors is, Thou haste not done to me only wrong, but my suffraunce has
(beyond my pleasure) given knowledge to many of my torment, in such sort
that many that would love, have been put back, and are ferefull to do it.

Than sythen so it is, I pray ye that in reputing the of yt which is passed
thou emend it in time to come, being not herafter so intier to my desaduan
tayge, to the end that by thy works, thou put pease to mine assaults, I know
not wherefore thou haste lost the will to be served, considering yt all others
desire it, but you alone, who refuses it. It is than easy to know that I have
more necessytye of thy mercy, than thou have desyer that I serve the. O what
afflyctyons have presented to me my so great faith, and the little hope yt I
have of the, which as thou know, have intierly fallen my health, in such
sort, yt when lest of me thou have playned the, more my dolor has augmented
it self helas if it were possible for me to declare with the mouth yt which I
have thought in my spyryte, how much wrong sholdest thou give the for the
ill that thou haste done me, Never man had less good, Never man suffered so,
Never of so great memory was received so great obliu^on, mine affection, and
thy mysco^tentacyon give me ye death which I have wylled to make the to
understand to thend that hereafter, thou be to me a dame, maystres, and
friend, and yt thou have knowledge by my great dyspleasure, of my most great
constancy, which for all these torments has never varied nor has not ben
weary to suffer them, but rather has esteemed that for his gayn, which he has
lost by the, and not without great reason, For I have not had less occasion
to have pain, than thou have beaultye to give it me. Sy then than that I am
sure that thou know ye love, whereof I love y^, thou shalt do iniustyre to
reason and to my faith if in the thou establysshe not other facyons of doing,
restorynge by thy good deeds them, whom by desperation thou have destayned,
and to the end that thou begin to exercise works of repentance, consent for y^
merit, that is dew to me that I kys thy hands, desyring the humbly net to
deny me this benyfyte, wout ever to require any other thing of the, And if
thou se that I do the contrary, yield me in payment by my pain and thine
obly^ion.

The answer of Lucenda / to Arnalt.
Arnalt if I had the word so much at commandment as y^, I would answer the
so well as thou caust lamente thy self, and y^ should not be lesie cased of
y^ which I should tell the, tha^ thou remaynest sorrowful for that I do. Thy
presence and my shame have so strayetely assyeged me as I know not what to
say, neither wyshe seeing that already by yt I have done, I have so hurt mine
honor, as it is hard to hele the same, for a thing that I can tell the, for
albeit that mine ^gnoraunce does absoyle me, the reason nevertheless does
condemn my reputacio^, which I have put in danger for not to offend the*
Thou say that I as repentaunt of mine ylles passed, should convert thy hard
pain in to grace present. But by a greater occasion ought I rather to weep the
fault that I have done than to lament ye ylles that thou have, sythen that by
honor they are to the tolerable, and that ye ercour which I have now
committed does turn it self against me, to my exceadynge great reproach, and
y^ more is thou as a man can endure that which to me a young dainosell is not
parmitted to suffer. So the danger y^ threteneth me, in speaking to the, may^
turn the more to dysaduauntage than to any recompense, for that I fere thou
can not commit this victory to silence, in so much that the possession of
semblable favor co^stray neth comtyme the tongue to forget that which the
heart and reason endeavor to keep secret. But if thou so do it that shall be at
my charge, Alas how much more has thine importunity had power than my
defense what should she be that to believe the should not be unfaithful to her
self. Alas how dangerous is the parsuasyon of men toward us, others simple
women. The beginning where of (if we were wise) we ought above all other things
te^chewe. And because I find my self deceived, other ought to take example by
me.

Haa sorrowful Lncenda, thou art now abond woman, and thou Atnalte tryumphant
in this vyctory, Nevertheless beware that thexceding great glory of the same
make the not to lose (by extreme joy) yt which thou haste gained with so
great doloure. Remember the that ye secret heals that which the opener does
wound Thou prayest me yt thou may kys my hands, I am content therewith,
provided that thou think not, that I take it for presumpsion, and upon such
manner and condycyon, ye from hensforth thou shall abstain the to be so
importunate towardesme. And of this be thy suster witness, that has already done
so much for the, as she has given occasyon that I have so forgotten my self,
as to do yt which I do.

Arnalte to the Pilgrim.
LUce^da had not scarce ended her matter, but ye hour forced us to depart,
because there came so many people into the church, that the were constrained
hastily to retire from thens. Nevertheless it was not without receuinge the
benefyte yt she had promised me, to kys her fair ha^^es. After my suster and I
took licens and departed, either into his house, O god if I were put to chose
the domynation of all the world, to lose y^ benyfite, that I had, I call to
wytnes them that parfytly do love, that my joy was worth much more than y^.
So I departed thens content, by the mean whereof my suster seeing me, releued
of so great a fall, contynewed by all means to entertayne me in pleasure. And
in deed prayed me that I would go to solace me in a place of hers, that nere
was to the City of Che^es, whereunto I agreed wyllingly, wher^y at the same
hour the enterprise was executed, and because ye situation of y^ place was
acco^modate to the pleasure of y^ chayse, I caused some sorts of hawks to be
brought with me, tastaye with this pastyine, and the ^enyfyte that I had lately
received of Lucenda to return to my first health.

Now ^eyng there arrived, I was by my suster so well fested, and with so good
^her* received, yt a little after the color, and the force that I had lost
returned in me. But it happened that one day as I would go a huntyng as I
thought to leap to my horse, many south sayers came to me to declare my fall
to come, for suddenly the weather y^ was fair and clear showed it self
cloudy, and full of tempest, and a spaynell that much I loved ran between my
legs and quakynge, y^ one would marvel, he^ began to baye and cry ferefully,
And I yt than little cared for the southsayers, neither of cases semblable for
all these causes, fered not mine enterprise. So puttyng a faulcon upon my
fyste, I went to the feldes, howbeit scarce had I co^menced that which I
sought. But I began to remember, yt there was now a long time sith I saw the
gentylman of whom hertofore I told the. And that never sith I had declared
the affection that I had to Lucenda, he showed me so good cou^tenau^ce as he
was wont for little and little he absented him self from me, without more to
vyset me, neither tenquyre what I did, and because y^ the more part of men at
variable in amity, I thought that the same had been the cause of his abse^ce,
and on the other part, I thought that it should be impossyble to him to se me to
suffer ill, where he could give me remedy, But as I was in this thought the
faulcon that I bare upon my fyst, fell styffe deed upon y^ ground, which
augment^d all togy there the presumptyon y^ was suddenly come to me upon my
compaguyon Yerso. For my heart much panted im mediatly. And I began to think
of my dog, that so cryeo in y^ morninge, by the mean whereof I wylled to
depart to my lodging, than I came by chance by an hills side from the
which easily I might decerne the lodginge of Luce^da, where I hard a brute of
taberdes and shalmes, that sownded in the mountains which I found strange,
because the season was not convenient for such pastime. Wherefore I becam more
pe^syfe the before, and entered in great suspicyon of my damage to come, yet
being in the place from whens, I might deserne the lodging of the which
proceeded my trust, I held me there so longetyme, y^ the night suddenly came
upon me, before y^ I could return to my suster, who had accustomed to tarry
for me, wha^ I was abroad, and come to receive me at the enter of her house,
which she did not than, which augmentyd all my doubts, and that yet worse was
being arrived in the place where she was, she spoke not one word at all to me,
but she had her face so sorrowful y^ it was marvel, tha^ becam I much
abashed, because she spoke not to me, I durst not any thing inquire of her,
doubting to understand by her purposes y^ news that somuche I fered, yet at
thend I could not forbere, that I demanded her not, what moved her to be so
melancholy. Than she put her somuche to weep that for thabundaunce of her
tears she could not answer me till her weeping was diminisshed, and that she
had the word free, than she decla red to me that this day Luce^da was married
to yerso, whom I esteemed so much for my friend. When I under stood this
matter, I promise the pilgrim my friend, that I thought to dye suddenly, for I
had my heart so seized, y^ on every point my forces failed me, and my doloure
renewed it self, in such sort as I could not speak, than my diuinatures
were known. than the brute herd by me on y^ hills side was reveled to me, by
y^ mean whereof I fell in the place so rudely y^ they y^ were present esteemed
me traun sed, after as soon as I could recover me, I took the letters that I
had received of Lucenda, and tare them in pieces, enteringe in such
desperation, that I tare my berde, and my here. Albeit that such effects ar
feminine yet love by his laws does reduce often his subjects in this
extremytye, A little while after that the co^for^e of my suster and the reason
had put to mine ylles some yease, I caused to apparel all my saruauntes with
blake mourning, And a little after a woman servant in whom Lucenda had great
trust came to me to cause me to understand the part of her maystris yt in this
marriage she had been forced, and that more by thimportunytie of her parents,
than by her consent was constrained to enclyne thereunto. After I had long hard
her, and she accomplisshed her message she returned from thence, leauyng me
more than before in dolor and sorowfulnes, and it is necessary that thou
understand, that she found me apparelled in a black Cape, about the which
were letters in broderye and scripture such.

Tell her syne that she is pleased
Of her captyfe to be the bond
That my life I have reserved
Living by see, or else by land.
THis chambryere wise and well advised had great compassion of my dolor, and it
is expedient that thou understand she had charge of her maystres to take heed
as well to mine apparel, as to my fassyon of doing By the mean whereof she cast
her eye upon this cape, and retained very well the deuyse written about it.
After she departed toward Luce^da leaving me in no less despite of this
marriage, than sorrowful for the treason y^ yerso had done me. Which so
empressed it self in my spyryte, that I concluded to fight with him, to cause
him to recoginse it before ye king and every other parson. And therefore I sent
him a cartell whereof ye matyers were such.

The Cartell of Arnalt to yerso.
YErso to the^de that every one know how traytourous have been the mysoremyd
purposes wherwt in secret thou have abused me I will now inpublyke manifest them
thentent y^ from hensforthe thy punysshement be for others eternal example,
and to render to thy fault egall chastisme^t, I trust with yo hands to
vanquysshe the, and by words to dyf fame the, and that by y^ mean of thy
mysoemeanoure, and thassuraunce y^ I have i^ my good right. But to the^d that
thou judge yt thy self, and that none excuse the, have remembrance how long
we have had togythers amity fraternell and sworn company by the mean whereof,
thynkyng that thou were faithful, I declared to the intierely my secrettes
without coun celyng any from ye, and among others thaffectyon that I had to
Lucenda, wherein thou thy self haste entertained me and promised to aid me,
thou spakest well, than like an ill man to de ceaue me, thou dyddest cause me
to understand* by many means that thou were well content, gyuynge me thy
faith, y^ albeit thou were her saruau^t yet (for the love of me) thou would
leave it, which I believed unto that the effect did iniurye to thy word, and
that in hydyng y^ from me, thou haste robbed me, and taken her to thy wife
making the vsurpateur of the recompense of my trauayles, this doing y^ have
wylled to become not only mine enemy, but also thy own, whereof I have much
maruayle for I know vell that thou know how much y^ virtue and the works
of amytie are comfortable, yet before yt thou regardest that thou dydest well
to defyle and defame thy renown by great treason nakynge the, different from
y^ virtue of y^ pare^tes, no less than y^ whighte ^s known from the couloute
black. Now to the end that of so great vyany thou quyckely receive shame.

Thou shalt understand that with he weapons that thou wylt chose, I will kill
the, and will put the by force out of the camp, where I will make the to know
that thou haste done the greatest vylanye and disloialtie, that could be
thought. For with the aid of god my hands and y^ same thine infydelytie shall
give me entyer vengeance of the, therefore chose the weapons as it is y^
custom, after having herd thine answer, I will assygne y^ the camp and the
day.

The answer of yerso to the Cartell.
ARnalt I have received thy cartell, and according to that thou say, if
thou have theffect so much at the advantage as thy words are dysmeasured, I
yield me all ready vanquyshed, and repute y^ the vanqueroure. But it shall goo
well otherwise, for in my hands y^ shall find no less force, than in thy
words I have found infamye. But as far as I think thou art to say, and I to
execute, So thy pride shall be the cause that the estraungers (for the in ^urye
that thou doste me) and thy parents and friends (by that which I will do to
the shall little plain the, se ynge that it should be great injustice if with
y^ death which thou so much deseruest thou should not receive the
chastisment of thy glory. Thou say that to thend yt my fault be clerly
known, I should remember me of our so common amytie, with the which thou
dyddest communicate to me thy most secret affairs. Surely I will not deuy it,
for tha^ I should go much against reason and verytie. But I have known better
to keep it, than thou thy self to conferme it, so y^ if openly thou had
not so manyfestly dyffa med me, I had in secret satisfied the, in y^ wherein
thou chargest me, And surer I am that after thou had herd me speak thou
should have holde^ me more for thy faithful friend thou for an ill man or
deceauour, co^ syderynge that asmoche for thy reme dye and salvation, as for my
pleasure or prosyte I have taken Lucenda to wife, trustyng y^ this marriage
should make an end of thy tormente. And also that seeing the in dysposytion to
live but a while and much to suffer, me thought it for the best to do y^ I
have done. To the end yt having not more trust therein thou myghtest recover
thy desperate health, what so ever it be they that by appearance shall Judge
thereof, shall think it more for incertayn, than for lykely to be true, that
whereof thou gyuest me y^ charge. But because that the intencion absoyleth or
condempneth, I temyt me to the same and also the veryte of this deed ought to
prove it self more by effect than by words. Therefore y^ judgment shall
surcease unto the day of therecution. Than thou shall se how much thou
had gained to hold thy peace, and that which thou shall lose to have so
unjustly spoken, for my right, and thy pride than shall be judged. But sythen
that to y^, and to thy like, I would little speak and rudely execute, I
aduertyse the that I will make the vnsaye it as an ill and unjust parson, and
to do this I chose such weapons, we shall be armed in estate of men of arms
except y^ right arm which shall be bare, the speres egall / and either of us,
two swerdes ye horses berdyd with chauffrens and crymeneres.

Therefore when y^ wylt, appoynte the day and place, for with the aid of him
that between, thine unjust and mine ygnoraunce ought to be judge, I trust to
kill the, or to put the out of the Camp or else to vanqueshe the as it is
reason.

Arnalte to the Auctoure.
Sythen that the wepons were appointed, I retired me to the king, whom I
informed trewely of all that which was passed between yerso and me. And because
that thyn fydelite of mine enemy was thought to him very estrau^ge, he was
content in obseruenge the laws upon such seats establysshed, to give and
parmyt us the camp, after at y^ day assy gned yerso and I were before his ma
iestye who had caused to be made an esch affaulte to se who should remain the
vanquerour. Than he went to so our weapons, which he found egall wherefore
after y^ oaths in such cases accustomed, and that the Herauldes had done their
debnoure we entered in to the Camp, to do our force and ran the one against
the other, with such strengh, that with the force of the metynge the little
amytie that we bare the one to the other might know it self. But as yerso was no
less handsome than a good ryder he took me in tharme that I bare dysarmed, and
hurt me sore, as to me I gave him only in the vyser / but I could not so
justly take him that I did him any ill, how beit our speres flewe in pe^es by
the mean whereof we had redely recours to our sword^, with the which by great
endeavor the medlynge began in such sort as the longnes and sharpnes of the
fight was such that the assystence were werye to se us and we to lay on, and
to make it short to the, the lot fell upon yerso, who remained vanquysshed.
And thereby his iniustyce was known, and my good right opened and declared,
howbeit yerso estemynge more the honor both of him and his, than this propre
life, would not in any wise unsay it, but rather receive than with shame and
dysonour longer to live, So Lucenda remained wedowe, I vyctoryouse, and he
vanquysshed out of the camp. Wherefore y^ company severed them selfs, and I
reryred me in to my house. And as I caused my wou^des to be looked on, I was by
chau^se aduertysed of the great mournyng that Luce^da made for thin fortunie
come to her deed housbande. Therefore I de termyned to offer me to her, and to
re ceyue her for my wife, if it were agree able to her, trusting by this (...)
to cause her to forget the moruynge y^ she bare for my deed enemy, Th^^ I
wrote to her in this sort.

The Letter of Arnalte to Lucenda.
LUcenda if in the time of so great war I demand the peace, I pray y^ take
it not in ill part seeing that which I do, is for more testeme thy virtue
great, than y^ fault that I have committed toward the, as to the myschaunce
come in y^ parsone of thy deed husband, the vsurpateur of my most great
riches, thonly god has knowledge of the dyspleasure that I have thereof,
howbeit if he have dyspleased me by his occasyo^ he has pleased me for thine,
for that if I had not offended the, thou had d^st not known to manifest y^
virtue to pardon that is in the, the which among all is worthy of praise.
Than to th^nde that in pardonynge me the same virtue may be apparaunt to all
others, govern y^ dyspleasure by dyscretion. For if thou do otherwise thy
repu^acyon shall dyminysshe thereby, and shall resnayne blamed, will not than to
deney me the benefyte that I require y^ to satysfye us both, doing mercy to
him of whom thou sholdest demand pardone. Helas I know thou art so
sorwfull, that I much dought to come to mine intent, sythe^ I have failed
thereof in y^ time, that thou had more occasyon to do the same. But I
proteste I will not demand the any thing whereof thou may take displeasur,
for if my pain do constrayne me to do otherwise, the fear does turn me from
it. Nevertheless if thou wylt order the by the way of reason, thou ought
testeme the more enemy of thy self then of me, that is thine, for if I have
killed thine husband, his death has been the end of one life. But thou that
haste caused many to dye, never repen rest the of one sole. So than think of
me that which y^ wylt be presumed of the, and if thou do that, I feel all ready
mine offense remytted. Thy deed husband has wounded me, so that it is much
doubted of my healynge, yet I fere not in any wise the danger nor all y^ ill
that I have thereof, nor it is no torment to me, for by a long time I have been
by the so mortally oultrayged, that this first doloure which touches me in
y^ spryte does blemishe and stayne the other, y^ only does empire my body, so
much the more as the same shall receive healynge, the more that of the spryte
engreueth and augmentith it self, I am contynually dremynge a thousand
things, in some I find comfort thinking thy life in repose, in others all
the contrary, And one only thing gives me some trust, which I will de clare
to ye* To the end y^ of my loyalty and great faith thou be more assured. But
before I do it have remembrance that which the death destroys is
irrecuperable what so ever vows, an gre or wepynges, be made therefore, trust
not to call again thy husband by thabundaunce of tears, neither by great
mourning. But for the better renew in me the faith that thou had dest in him,
and sythen I have taken him away from the, I will give my self to the, if it
be agreeable to y^, Nevertheless* ^f the love of him do blind the so that thou
thynkest that I am not worthy for the, give not faith al together to thy
judgment, but take thaduyse of another, for this new accydent (peradventure)
has all ready, vanquysshed thine. Than thou shall se, whether thine advise
shall be conform to it, yt thy friends would give the, It is expedient I tell
the, that by reason he that could va^quyshe thine busbande may well merit the
place of him, of my lineage I will not speak to the, because thou knoweste it
better than I could now write it to the. But wether thou ought to be my
wife, for the merit of my travail I make the judge thereof, knowing that thou
knoweste well, how much to love the I have hated my propre life. Therefore if
thou have desire to give place, to my request I pray the aduer tyse me thereof
incontinent.

The Auctoure foldweth his matter.
When my Letter was ended I caused my Suster to come who was no less sorrowful
for ye wou^ des that I had, than glad for the vyctorye gained. Albeit that in
some sort the death of him that was vanquysshed grieved her much, at her
aryuall I declared to her mine enterprise, praying her to tell me her advise.
Tha^ she answered me that she found this delyberacyon very strange, and yet
that sythen my dolor might slake it self, by this mean she cou^sayled me to
do it, by somoche was her opynion conform to mine, as she took my letter. And
than went to Lucenda who so soon as she parceyued my Suster prayed her that
she would come to the marriage, whereof I had given her y^ occasyon, my suster
knew not what she meant. But after she might well kuowe it by theffecte, for at
the same hour all her kynsfolkes were assembled togythers to conduct her in to
a Relygyon, where she had choysen to live the rest of her life. And because y^
my suster was arrived at that hour she would se what should be the end of this
enterprise, which was such y^ Luce^da was made a Nonne vyolate and entered
into the monastery, where my suster conducted her, and because that rather she
had not oprtunitie she than declared to her mine entencion, finding her
conuenyently, howbeit so sone as she understood to name me only she retired
from my suster, and with a marvelous dysplesure left her sole saying to the
Abbess, y^ she was not entered in to her house to consent that the suster of
her mortal enemy should come thither to importune her which my suster
understanding departed out of the monastery and returned toward me, wyllyng
subtylly to dysguyse from me such sorrowful news, howbeit by my suspecyon
the dyssymulatyon was at the last dyscouered, so that she was constrained to
cause me to understand all the hole truth, helas what is that lover, y^
having had like dysfauoure would not demand straight the death / which
incontinent were given me, if the force of the presents had not preserved me
there from, Helas the same had been well agreeable to me for that it had supplied
yt fault of mine infortuni^. So remained I without more to trust any remedy
for all means of comfort, haba^doned me wherefore knoweng not to whom to have
recours, I retired me toward god, desyeryng him most humbly to have petye of
me. But for my deserts I was not herd, and fyndyng not comfort of mine ylles
toward god, neither in the world I determined to go in to a place so
solytarye that none should ever se me, albeit wha^ my suster was advertised
thereof, she was so a frayde that she thought to dye, and she came toward me
weeping so bytterly y^ I had great pite thereof, afterward she cast her to my
fete, and thinkyng to break mine enterprise she told me.

Belysa to her Brother.
HAa my Brother I have known yt for texecute thy will in absentynge thy self
from reason, thou haste enterprysed a very strange voyage wherein straight thou
will travail. Helas I pray ye for gods sake yt thou wylt forget this
fantazye and be not occasyon to cause folks to speak of the to thy
dysaduauntage* Consider that they yt shall se ye depart will say it is more
for the fear of the kynsfolkes of yerso, then for y^ pain of y^ love, forse
inco^ueuiences to the end of the same, before that thou come to repent the,
which does accustom to present it self after y^ remedy is absent, seek not
by thine abse^ce to make thy renown to perysshe. And if that constrayne the
not, remember y^ that thou leauest me sole, y^ know well y^ mine honor by
thine is co^serued and that if thou go I shall be esteemed hereafter rather an
estraunger, than a damoysell of Thebes, have thou for gotten that by the last
pestelence we were depryued from our father and mother and of the most part of
our kyns folks, and yet being with ye I have always thought to be no less
fathered and mothered and otherwise frended, than when they all lived,
consyderest thou not, what thou losest in losinge thy fre^des, Regard yt the
king has nourysshed the, y^ country that thou leauest, and the great
benefytes y^ thou refusest to follow away so crooked Believe me my brother and
beware to do that thing whereof afterward thou be reprehended and ill
esteemed. The mountains knew not any pray se the bestes cruel make no
dyffere^ce between y^ virtuous and the ill neither the birds have no
judgment to comfort the. So who shall in this place prase such fears of
arms, as thou have done or plain y^ time that thou shall lose here in respect
to contynew to get here praise and high renown in battles, have thou
forgotten that in things most sharp and dyfficyll the gentle hertes efforce
them, and augment their force, if in this thou have not regard, think at the
least, that thy works and thy renown shall perysshe with thy banishement, and
y^ more is if it happen that thou have ylles, or trauayles i^ these solytary
places who shall aid y^ to sustayn them is it not than better for the, not to
refuse this country nor them with whom thou haste accoustomed to live, with out
to use such desperatyon, to go to lose the with the beasts in the desert so
solytarye, where thou shall find none that comfort the or do the aid, and I
sorrowful to whom shall, may I complain me, when the kynsfolke of yer to after
thy departure shall torment me. Ha my brother for the honor of god I pray the
to moderate thy dolor, and comfort the in thy self. Than thou shall se how
much mine advise is better, if thou tarry than y^ damage that thou shall have
in absentynge the. Suffer never y^ by thy mean I dye in recompense of ye amyte
that I bear the.

The answer of Arnalte.


My dear suster I have well understand all that thou haste told me, wherein I
will satysfye the. And therefore I pray the believe that I have well thought to
an y^ which thou have showed me, and in th^nking thereon received upon every
point a very great passion, so that all togythers have given me a torment
worse than the death, specially in y^ which towcheth the (for others in
respect) thereof ar little to me, because tha^ y^ doloure that I receive for
love, preserves me as he y^ loves, may know wherein of some I shall be excused,
and of others by wrong conde^pned whereof I wyllytten care, for like as y^
virtue known, can not be offended so y^ ^udgeme^tes that shall be made of me
shall be found commonly faulse, Thou tellest me that it shall be publyshed y^
^ayther the fear of ye kinsfolks of yer so, than my martyr has caused my
departure, fearing to receive the payment of that which I have done to him.
Assure the that they y^ know to love will, never hold* so foul purposes. For
they know that y^ virtue of the courage is famylyer to the love. And further I
am not so ill wylled, nor of all so little known y^ my renow me is not much
more than suffycyente, to break such false report* Thou pray est me to have
remembrance of my servants, and of the great wealth of the same, I have such
memory that such as will follow me, more to cause them to know the love that*
I ^ere them, than for the necessyte y^ I have of them. I will carry them with me,
and of mine other gooddes from hensforth, I make them thine. As to the rest
esteem me not so negligent that I will leave the sole. But before my departure*
I will get the an husband* that shall bear the company. Of one thing new. I
pray the that is thou take courage* to the^d that when the day of my departure
shall come, thy dolor do not double my trouble. And for the fast request
that ever I trust to make y^, I pray the, y^ without end thou lameut the of
Lurenda making eternal me morie of my perdicyo^, and of her trueltye.
Nevertheless if thou se her some time in the terms of repentance, that only
without more, thou keep the from vengeance, sythen ye in that benyfyt
consysteth the mean of my trust so desperate. And upon this point, I will
cesse from longer to find the co^municatio^, to take away from the thoccasyo^
more timportune me thinking to turn my voyage. And therefore my suster speak
not to me thereof at any time herafter, wherefore after I was hole of my wounds
I went, to the king whom I prayed to give an husband to my suster, which he
promised me to do. And after that in this case, his will and my desire were
executed, I was greatly importuned by him upon the delay of mine enterprise.
But for somoche as his will was contrary, and discor daunte to mine intention,
we tarried in co^traryete of opinion leuenge him assured of my departure,
whereof he was so dyspleased, that he would not give me license, but putting
back all things specially the wepynges, and lamentacyons of my dear suster.
After many farewellys and enbraseme^tes of my friends I took my journey, whereof
the king being aduertysed would with his gentyluie^ do me somoche honor as
to conducte me out of the City. But because yt with out to moleste the, I can
not declare to the the matyers that than passed between us. I am content to
concele them. At the end the wepynges of my suster and my tears made for ever
y^ seperacyo^ of us two, where by y^ king and his returned in to the city,
and I and mine entered in to our sorrowful journey, following the which a little
while after, I felt my spyrite dyscharged much of the heaviness of his fardell,
therefore all resolute, I found better the way that I had chosen, than my
taryenge at Thebes, for mine infortunye desired more that I should live the
rest of my days among ye beasts brute, than among creatures reasonable,
albeit that their condytours be entyerly different from ours. By y^ mean
whereof having iornied by a long time I came by chance into this sharp and
solitary mountain, in the which considering the sytuation. I determined here
to edyfy this house so sorrowful of semblable matyer as a^ made ye works of
Luce^da. So master my friend thou know now the secret tormente and war
that I have sustained to love. And if my long matyer has dyfferred thy
voyage, and that a parsone so unfortunate has not deserved yt for him thou
sholdest receive so much dyspleasure, I pray the pardone him. And to the rest
sythen thou deternynest to depart hens this day have remembrance of the gayge
ye I have of thy faith, and of the promysses that thou haste made me, which ar
that thou shalt universally publysshe, and cause the dames wise and dyscreate
to understand the things that I have commycate to the.
