A merry pronosticacion
For the year of Christ's incarnacyon
A thousand five hundredth fortye and four
This to pronostycate I may be bold
That wha^ the new year is come gone is ye old.
::


OF this year for to pronosticate
It apperteyneth not to a ^oole nor dodypate
To pronostyque of the influence of this year
For though they would they were never ye nere
But I shall tell you of this pronostyca^ion
Wherein in it takes his chief foundacyon
Of the Eclyps.
When I consydre Ptholome I find
That ye Eclyps of the soune does pass my mi^de
For Capricornus and Aries declarynge the same
That Cancer and Libra were out of frame
Saturn and Mars shows it plain
The eight day of Apryl it may chance to rain
For Jupiter and Taurus when all is done
Declares a certain Eclyps of the son
But Venus and Mercury by their operacyon
Denies that Virgo has any constyllacyon
For the Eclyps of ye son and also of the Moon
Shall be surely, I can not tell how soon
Wherefore Ptholome in his Centiloquium
Tells not before what after shall come
Therefore I pronostyque as nigh as I can
Of things that shall happen now and than
And surely or the year go about
Some of them may chance without doubt
Of the four quarters of this year.
Because in heaven there be many martyrs
Truly this year shall be four quarters.
Winter, Pryme time, Somer and Harvest
But here Ptholome I find thou swaruest
For Ptholome shows not whereof I wondre
That Virgo is a ma^uaylous sign of thundre
Venus and Jupiter be moist and cold
Noughty signs for them that be old
But I say if the nynth day of Nouembre
Had fallen upon tenth day of Decembre
It had been a meruaylous hot year for bees
For then had the Moon ben like a grene chese
Somer begyneth the first day of June
And they shall go bare for that have no show
Sometime inclyned to be hot in the air
If it be not foul, then it shall be fair
For Mars and Mercury be signs of heat
Men shall not be cold as ^ouge as they sweat
By the reason that Libra in the occidental
Shall be wyndye and dry in the Eclypsal
For saturn, and Mars, and also Libra
Be precedent with a ^ex^^le, et cetera.
Of the twelve months.
Because that Saturn is dominator here
I find y^ there shall be twelve months the year
And every month contaynynge four wekes
Because in ^ent they make portage with ^ekes
Days and hour shall not be strange
For every month the Moon shall change
By Mars and Mercury sometime I find
That this year shall be great store of wind
For men and women wha^ they have well dynde
shall have no power to hold fast behind
The bla^^ shall be bosterous, byg and outrageous
Wherefore the air must needs be contagious
And except that God work by his great grace
The wind shall not always stand styli one place
Sometime the blastes shall be pretye and soft
And sometime of force they shall come a loft
But if the blastes break out, beyond ye ^rynke
The clouds cannot be cle^ly, but ye air shall s^ike
But Venus and Virgo it appears plain
That enuyous persons shall be full of disdain
Sometime frost and so^etyme snow
And so^etyme in the element percha^ce a rayn bow
Sometime mystes with moystnes mutable
Because that Venus in this point is varyable
Than the cock crewe and than it was day
Tha^ the bullock brake lose and the rope ra^e away
Of diseases and syckenesses.
Diverse dyseases shall rain this year
Some shall dye, and some shall ^ary here
Some shall have such sore pain in their hedes
They shall sleep on benches for lack of beds
A common disease both in town and city
Shall raygne this year, the more is the pytye
As Well in the country as in the city town
Many shall not be able to chaun^e a crown
And some shall sing so woeful a note
That they shall not be able to change a grote
This is because of the Eclyps of the Moon
Some shall lope their potage for lack of a spon
In the the somer time shall be such an hear
For Saturn and Mars have full well discust
That in the eclyps Mercury is combust
Of such as be under the son.
Kings, Princes, and Lords of might
This year shall ^e the son give light
Except the clouds so cover her beams
Or el^es she shall shine in all Christen realms
Of the Venustians
The children of Venus shall prosper but little
Because that lazers shall be in the spyttle
Some children of Venus shall burn in such love
That their hands shall be fyt for every glove
Some will love more than a thousand fold
But hot love this year wylbe soue cold
Of Marcurialles
Advocates, and orators we ye good pore proctors
Shall Be i as good case as some honest doctors
The eclyps declares them to be suspecte
Of taking of brybes being therwithin fecte
Of Lunatistes.
Messangers wits shall be so far spent
Somtymes shall forget wherefore they were sent
Marynars shall sail into many lands
But some parchaunce shall stycke in the sands
If madmen this year be as mad as hearts
Then shall madmen play madmens parts
To declare any farther of the eclyps of the son
I can do no more then I have done
The fassyon of us pno^^ycators, evermore was
To speak of some things y^ never came to pas
Therefore when yeshal our falsholde espy
Do no more but give us a little leave to lie
Of Kings.
What kings shall do this year I cannot tell
For in Gods secrets I was never sent so well
But I trust that Henry our most noble King
Contynually in honor shall florysshe and spring
We Kateryne his wife and Prince Edward his son
And as well for do as they have hitherto done
AMEN.
