LONDON. Printed for William Ponsonbie. Anno Domini. 1593.



TO MY DEAR LADY AND SISTER, THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKE.
HEre now have you (most dear, and most worthy to be most dear Lady) this
idle work of mine: which I fear (like the Spiders web) will be thought
fitter to be swept away, then worn to any other purpose. For my part, in very
truth (as the cruel fathers among the Greeks, were wont to do to the babes
they would not foster) I could well find in my heart, to cast out in some
desert of forgetfulness this child, which I am loath to father. But you
desired me to do it, and your desire, to my heart is an absolute
commandment. Now, it is done only for you, only to you: if you keep it to
your self, or to such friends, who will weigh errors in the balance of good
will, I hope, for the fathers sake, it will be pardoned, perchance made much
of, though in it self it have deformities. For indeed, for seuerer eyes it is
not, being but a trifle, and that triflingly handled. Your dear self can best
witness the manner, being done in loose sheets of paper, most of it in your
presence, the rest, by sheets, sent unto you, as fast as they were done. In
sum, a young head, not so well stayed as I would it were, (and shall be when
God will) having many many fancies begotten in it, if it had not been in some
way delivered, would have grown a monster, and more sorry might I be that
they came in, then that they gat out. But his chief safety, shall be the not
walking abroad; and his chief protection, the bearing the livery of your
name; which (if much much good will do not deceive me) is worthy to be a
sanctuary for a greater offender. This say I, because I know the virtue so;
and this say I, because it may be ever so, or to say better, because it will be
ever so. Read it then at your idle times, and the follies your good judgment
will find in it, blame not, but laugh at. And so, looking for no better
stuff, then, as in a Haberdashers shop, glasses, or feathers, you will
continue to love the writer, who does exceedingly love you, and most most
heartily prays you may long live, to be a principal ornament to the family
of the Sidneis.

Your loving brother. Philip Sidney.

To the Reader.
THE disfigured face, gentle Reader, wherewith this work not long since
appeared to the common view, moved that noble Lady, to whose Honor
consecrated, to whose protection it was committed, to take in hand the wiping
away those spots wherewith the beauties thereof were unworthily blemished. But
as often in repairing a ruinous house, the mending of some old part
occasioneth the making of some new: so here her honorable labor begone in
correcting the faults, ended in supplying the defectes; by the view of what was
ill done guided to the consideration of what was not done. Which part with what
advise entered into, with what success it has been passed through, most by
her doing, all by her directing, if they may be entreated not to define, which
are unfurnished of means to discern, the rest (it is hoped) will favorably
censure. But this they shall, for their better satisfaction, understand, that
though they find not here what might be expected, they may find nevertheless
as much as was intended, the conclusion, not the perfection of Arcadia: and
that no further then the Authors own writings, or known determinations could
direct. Whereof who sees not the reason, must consider there may be reason
which he sees not. Albeit I dare affirm he either sees, or from wiser
judgments then his own may hear, that Sir Philip Sidneies writings can no
more be perfected without Sir Philip Sidney, then Apelles pictures without
Apelles. There are that think the contrary: and no wonder. Never was Arcadia
free from the comber of such Cattle. To us, say they, the pastures are not
pleasant: and as for the flowers, such as we light on we take no delight in,
but the greater part grow not within our reach. Poor souls! what talk they
of flowers? They are Roses, not flowers, must do them good, which if they
find not here, they shall do well to go feed elsewhere: Any place will better
like them: For without Arcadia nothing grows in more plenty, then Lettuce
suitable to their Lips, If it be true that likeness is a great cause of liking,
and that contraries, infer contrary consequences: then is it true, that the
wortheles Reader can never worthily esteem of so worthy a writing: and as
true, that the noble, the wise, the virtuous, the courteous, as many as have had
any acquaintance with true learning and knowledge, will with all love and
dearness entertain it, as well for affinity with themselves, as being child
to such a father. Whom albeit it do not exactly and in every lineament
represent; yet considering the fathers untimely death prevented the timely
birth of the child, it may happily seem a thanke-woorthy labor, that the
defects being so few, so small, and in no principal part, yet the greatest
unlikeness is rather in defect then in deformity. But howsoever it is, it is now
by more then one interest The Countess of Pembrokes Arcadia: done, as it was,
for her: as it is, by her. Neither shall these pains be the last (if no
unexpected accident cut off her determination) which the everlasting love of
her excellent brother, will make her consecrate to his memory.

THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKES ARCADIA WRITTEN BY SIR PHILIP SIDNEI. THE FIRST
BOOK.
IT was in the time that the earth begins to put on her new aparrel against the
approach of her lover, and that the Sun running a most even course becums an
indifferent arbiter between the night and the day; when the hopeless
shepherd Strephon was come to the sands, which lie against the Island of
Cithera; where viewing the place with a heavy kind of delight, and sometimes
casting his eyes to the Ileward, he called his friendly rival, the pastor
Claius unto him, and setting first down in his darkened countenance a doleful
copy of what he would speak: O my Claius, said he, Urania printed the
farewell of all beauty? Well then, Remembrance commanded, we obeyed, and
here we find, that as our remembrance came ever clothed unto us in the form
of this place, so this place gives new heat to the fever of our languishing
remembrance. Yonder my Claius, Urania lighted, the very horse (me thought)
bewailed to be so disburdned: and as for thee, poor Claius, when thou wentst
to help her down, I saw reverence and desire so divide thee, that thou did
at one instant both blushe and quake, and in stead of bearing her, Urania? O
Urania, blessed be thou Urania, the sweetest fairness and fairest sweetness:
with that word his voice brake so with sobbing, that he could say no further;
and Claius thus answered. Alas my Strephon (said he) what needs this skore to
reckon up our thoughts above the ordinary level of the world, so as great
clearkes do not disdain our conference? has not the desire to seem worthy
in her eyes made us when others were sleeping, to sit vewing the course of
heavens? when others were running at base, to run over learned writings? when
other mark their sheep, Cupid? has in any, but in her, loue-fellowship
maintained frindship between riuals, and beauty taught the beholders
chastity? He was going on with his praises, but Strephon bad him stay, and
look: and so they both perceived a thing which floted drawing nearer and
nearer to the bank; but rather by the favorable Pyrocles, nor seeing nor
hearing cause of comfort, what (said he) and shall Musidorus live after
Pyrocles destruction? therewithal he offered wilfully to cast himself again
into the sea: a strange sight to the shepherds, to whom it seemed, that
before being in appearance dead had yet Claius presently went to a Fisherman,
and having agreeed with him, and provided some apparel for the naked
stranger, he embarked, and the Shepherds with him: and were no sooner gone
beyond the mouth of the haven, but that some way into the sea they might
discern (as it were) a stayne of the waters color, and by times some sparks
and smoke mounting thereout. But the young man no sooner saw it, but that
beating his breast, he cried, that there was the beginning of his ruin,
entreating them to bend their course as near unto it as they could: telling,
how that smoke was but a small relic of a great fire, which had driven

But a little way off they saw the mast, who^e proud height now lay along; like
a widow having lost her make of whom she held her honor: but upon the mast
they saw a young man (at least if he were a man) bearing show of about 18.
years of age, who sat (as on horseback) having nothing upon him but his
shirt, which being Neptune and Venus, that had made all this terrible
slaughter) as they went under sail by him, held up their hands and made their
prayers. Which when Musidorus saw, though he were almost as much ravished with
joy, as they with astonishment, he lept to the Mariner, and took the cord out
of his hand and (saying, do thou live, and art well? who answered,
Pyrocles: and therefore Musidorus could do no more but persuade the Mariners to
cast about again, assuring them that he was but a man, although of most
divine excellencies, and promising great rewards for their pain.

And now they were already come upon the stays; when one of the sailors
discried a Galley which came with sails and oars directly in the chase of
them; and straight perceived it was a well known Pirate, who hunted not only
for goods but for bodies of men, which he employed either to be his Galley
slaves, or to sell at the best market. Which when the Master understood, he
commanded forthwith to set on all the canuasse they could, and fly homeward,
leaving in that sort poor Pyrocles so near to be reskewed. But what did not
Musidorus say? what did he not offer to persuade them to venture the fight?
But fear standing at the gates of their ears, put back all persuasions: so
that he had nothing wherewith to accompany Pyrocles, but his eyes; nor to
succor him, but his wishes. Therefore praying for him, and casting a long
look that way, he saw the Galley leave the pursuit of them, and Pyrocles
shall that body of thine be enchained? shall those victorious hands of thine be
commanded to base offices? shall virtue beco^e a slave to those that be slaves
to viciousnes? Alas, better had it been thou had ended nobly thy noble days:
what death is so evil as unworthy servitude? Strephon and Claius (who being
themselves true friends, did the more perfectly judge the justness of his
sorrow) advise him, that he should mitigate somewhat of his woe,

Now sir (said they) thus for our selves it is. We are in profession but
shepherds, Kalander, who vouchsafes much favor unto us: A man who for his
hospitality is so much haunted, that no news stir, but comes to his ears;
for his upright dealing so beloved of Peloponnesus: and (which is worth all)
all these things give him not so much power, as his nature gives him will to
benefit: so that it seems no Music

Musidorus (who besides he was merely unacquainted in the country had his wits
them) they took their journey together through Laconia; Claius and Strephon by
course carrying his chest for him, Musidorus only bearing in his countenance
evident marks of a sorovvful-mind supported with a vveake body, which they
perceiving, and knovving that the violence of sorrow is not at the first to be
striuen vvithall: (being like a mighty beast, sooner tamed with follovving,
than overthrown by vvithstanding) Musidorus eyes (wearied with the wasted
soil of Laconia) with delightful prospects. There were hills which garnished
their proud Musidorus, then first vnsealing his long silent lips) what
countries be these we pass through, which are so diverse in show, the one
wanting no store, the other having no store but of want.

The country (answered Claius) where you were cast a shore, and now are past
Helots) has in this sort as it were disfigured the face of nature, and made
it so vnhospitall as now you have found it: the towns neither of the one side
nor the other,

But this country (where now you set your foot) is Arcadia: and even hard by
is the house of Kalander whether we lead you: this country being thus decked
with peace, and (the child of peace) good husbandry. These houses you see so
scattered are of men, because they desire not much. What cause then said
Musidorus, made you venture to leave this sweet life, and put your self in
yonder unpleasant and dangerous realm? Guarded with poverty (answered
Strephon) and guided with love: But now (said Claius) since it has pleased you
to ask any thing of us whose baseness is such as the Kalander, and he the
better know how to proportion his entertainment. Musidorus (according to the
agreement between Pyrocles and him to alter their names) answered, that he
called himself Palladius, and his friend Daiphantus; but till I have him

They perceived he was not willing to open himself further, and therefore
without Kalander knew that provision is the foundation of hospitality, and
thrift the fuel of magnificence. The house it self was built of fair and
strong stone, not affecting so much any extraordinary Musidorus, Strephon
privately told him all what he knevv of

Noe said Kalander (speaking alowd) I am no herald to enquire of men's
pedegrees, it suffices me if I know their virtues: which (if this young man's
face be not a false witness) do better apparel his mind, then you have done
his body. While he was thus speaking, there came a boy in show like a Merchants
prentice, who Strephon by the sleeue, delivered him a letter, written jointly
both to him and Claius from Urania: which they no sooner had read, but that
with short leaue-taking of Kalander (who quickly guest and smiled at the
matter) and once again (though hastily) recommending the young man unto him,
they went away, leaving Musidorus even loathe to part with them, for the good
conversation he had of them, and obligation in the knowing of him, and without
harkening unto a reply (like men whose hearts disdained all desires but one)
gate speedely away, as if the letter had brought wings to make them fly. But
by that sight Kalander soon judged that his guest was of no mean calling; and
therefore the more respectfully entertaining him, Musidorus found his sickness
(which the fight, the sea, and late travel had laid upon him) Kalander; which
was full of most precious stones, gorgeously and cunningly set in diverse
manners, desiring him he would keep those trifles, and if he died, he would
bestow so much of it as was needful, to find out and redeem a young man,
naming himself Daiphantus, as then in the hands of Laconia pirates.

But Kalander seeing him faint more and more, with careful speed conveyed him
to the most commodious lodging in his house: where being possessed with an
extreme burning fever, he continued some while with no great hope of life: but
youth at length got the victory of sickness, so that in six weeks the
excellency of his returned beauty was a credible ambassador of his health;
to the great joy of Kalander: Daiphantus: so at home did he omit nothing which
he thought might either profit or gratify Palladius.

For having found in him (besides his bodily gifts beyond the degree of
Admiration)

But Palladius having gotten his health, and only staying there to be in
place, where he might hear answer of the ships set forth, Kalander one
after noone led

In the midst of all the place, was afaire ponde, whose shaking crystal was
a perfect mirror to all the other beauties, so that it bare show of two
gardens: one in deed, the other in shadows: and in one of the thickets was a
fine fountain made thus. A naked Venus of white marble, wherein the grauer had
used such AEneas, who seemed (having begun to suck) to leave that, to look
upon her fair eyes, which smiled at the babes folly, mean while the breast
running. Hard by was a house of pleasure built for a Summer retiring place,
whether Kalander leading him, he found a square room full of delightful
pictures, made by the most excellent Diana when Acteon saw her bathing, in
whose cheeks the painter had set such a color, as was mixed between shame and
disdain: and one of her foolish Nymphs, who weeping, and with all lowering,
one might see the workman meant to set forth tears of anger. In another table
was Atalanta; the posture of whose lims was so lively expressed, that if the
eyes were the only judges, Helena, Omphale, Iole: but in none of them all
beauty seemed to speak so much as in a large table, which contained a comely
old man, with a lady of middle age, but of excellent beauty; and more excellent
would have been deemed, but that there stood between them a young maid, whose
wonderfulnesse took away Kalander answered, that it was made by Philoclea, the
younger daughter of his prince, who also with his wife were contained in that
Table: the painter meaning to represent the present condition of the young
Lady, who stood vvatched by an ouer-curious eye Palladius perceived that the
matter was vvrapt up in some secrecy, and therefore would for modesty
demand no further: but yet his countenance could not but with Kalander
perceauing, well said he, my dear guest, I know your mind, and I will
satisfy it: neither will I do it like a niggardly ansvverer, going no
further than the bounds of the question, but I will discover unto you,
asvvell that wherein my knowledge is common with others, as that which by
extraordinary means is delivered unto me: knovving so much in you

This country Arcadia among all the provinces of Greece, has ever been had
in singular reputation: partly for the sweetness of the air, and other
natural benefits, so largely here, that the very shepherds have their
fancies lifted to so high conceits, as the learned of other nations are content
both to borrow their names, and imitate their cunning.

Here dwells, and reigns this Prince (whose picture you see) by name
Basilius, a Prince of sufficient skill to govern so quiet a country, where
the good minds of

He being already well stricken in years, married a young princes, named
Gynecia, daughter to the king of Cyprus, of notable beauty, as by her picture
you see: a woman

Of these two are brought to the world two daughters, so beyond measure
excellent Pamela; by many men not deemed inferior to her sister: for my part,
when I marked them both^ me thought there was (if at least such perfections may
receive Philoclea, but more majesty in Pamela: me thought love plaide in
Philocleas eyes, and threatened in Pamelas: me thought Philocleas beauty only
persuaded, but so persuaded as all hearts must yield: Pamelas beauty used
violence, and such violence as no heart could resist: and it semes that such
proportion is between their minds; Philoclea so bashful as though her
excellencies Pamela of high thoughts, who auoides not pride with not knowing
her excellencies, but by making that one of her excellencies to be void of
pride; her mothers wisdom, greatness, nobility, but (if I can guess aright)
knit with a Basilius being so publicly happy as to be a Prince, and so
happy in that happiness as to be a beloved Prince, and so in his private
blessed as to have so excellent a wife, and so over excellent children, has of
late taken a course which yet makes him more spoken of then all these
blessings. For, having made a journey to Delphos, and safely returned, within
short space he brake up Philoclea, which was the cause they three were matched
together in this

Which though it be strange, yet not so strange, as the course he has
taken with the princess Pamela, whom he has placed in the other lodge: but
how think you accompanied? truly with none other, but one Dametas, the most
arrant doltish clown, that I think ever was without the privilege of a
babble, with his wife Miso, and daughter of Mopsa, in whom no wit can devise
any thing wherein they may Miso his wife, so handsome a beldame, that only
her face and her splay-foote have made her accused for a witch; only one good
point she has, that she observes decorum, having a froward mind in a wretched
body. Between these two personages (who never agreed in any humor, but in
disagreeing) is issued forth mistress Mopsa, a fit woman to participate of
both their perfections: but because a pleasant fellow of my acquaintance set
forth her praises in verse, I will only repeat them, and spare mine own
tongue, since she goes for a woman. The verses are these

What length of verse can serve brave Mopsas good to show?
Whose virtues strange, and beauties such, as no man them may know
Thus shrewdly burdned the^, how ca^ my Muse escape?

Like great God Saturn fair, and like fair Venus chaste:
As smooth as Pan, as Juno mild, like goddess Iris fast.
With Cupid she fore-sees, and goes god Vulcans pace:
And for a taste of all these gif^s, she steals god Momus grace,

Her twinkling eyes bedeckt with pearl, her lips as Saphir blew:
Her hair like Crapal-stone; her mouth O heavenly wide;
Her skin like burnisht gold, her hands like silver ure vntryde.
As for her parts unknown, which hidden sure are best:

Now truly having made these descriptions unto you, me thinks you should
imagine that I rather feign some pleasant devise, then recount a truth, that a
Prince (not banished from his own wits) could possibly make so unworthy a
choice. But truly Basilius conceauing a sudden delight, took him to his
Court, with apparent show of his good opinion: where the flattering courtier
had no sooner taken the Princes mind, but that there were straight reasons to
confirm the Princes doing, Dametas. His silence grew wit, his bluntness
integrity, his beastly ignorance virtuous simplicity: and the Prince
(according to the nature of great persons, in love with that he had done
himself) fancied, that his weakness with his presence would much be mended.
And so like a creature of his own making, he liked him more and more, and
thus having first given him the office of principal heardman, lastly, since he
took this strange determination, he has in a manner put the life of himself
and his children into his hands. Which authority (like too great a sail for
so small a boat) does so ouer-sway poor Dametas,

Thus much now that I have told you, is nothing more then in effect any
Arcadian knows. But what moved him to this strange solitarines has bin
imparted (as I think) but to one person living. My self can conjecture and in
deed more then Clitophon, who is now absent, preparing for his own marriage,
which I mean shortly shall be here celebrated. This son of mine (while the
Prince kept his Court) was of his bedchamber; now since the breaking up
thereof, returned home, and showed me (among other things he had gathered) the
coppie which he had taken of a Clitophon for the curiosity, which made him
break his duty in such a kind, whereby kings secrets are subject to be
revealed: but since it was done, I was content to take so much profit, as to
know it. Now here is the letter, Philanax, appointed by the Prince, Regent in
this time of his retiring, and most worthy so to be: for, there lives no man,
whose excellent wit more simplye imbraseth integrity, beesides his unfeigned
love to his master, wherein never yet Basilius or the Prince better: a rare
temper, while most men either seruile-ly yield to all appetites, or with an
obstinate austeritie looking to that they fancy good, in effect neglect the
Princes person. This then being the man, whom of all other (and most worthy)
the Prince chiefly loves, it should seem (for more then the letter I have not
to guess by) that the Philanax then lying sick) had written unto him his
determination, rising (as evidently appears) upon some Oracle he had there
received: whereunto he wrote this answer.

Philanax his letter to Basilius.
Most redouted and beloved prince, if as well it had pleased you at your going a
way of proceeding, as either prosperity must ensue; or, if the wickedness of
the world should oppress, it can never be said, that evil happens to him,
who falls accompanied with virtue: I would then have said, the heavenly powers
to be reverenced, and not serched into; and their mercies rather by prayers to
be sought, then so principal a charge of the Princess Pamela, (whose mind
goes beyond the governing of many thousands such) to such a person as Dametas
is (besides that the thing in it self is strange) it comes of a very evil
ground, that ignorance should be the mother of faithfulness, O no; he cannot be
good, that knows not why he is good, but stands so far good, as his fortune
may keep him unassayed: but coming once to that, his rude simplicity is
either easily changed, or easily deceived:


By the contents of this letter you may perceive, that the cause of all, has
been the vanity which possesses many, who (making a perpetual mansio^n of
this poor baiting place of man's life) are desirous to know the certainty of
things to come; wherein there is nothing so certain as our continual
uncertainty. But what in particular Philanax letter) he him self distinctly
knew. But this experience shows us, that Basilius judgment, corrupted with a
princes fortune, has rather hard then followed the wise (as I take it)
council of Philanax. For having left the stern of his government, with much
amazement to the people, among whom many strange Amphialus his nephew, and much
envy in the ambitious number of the Nobility against Philanax, to see Philanax
so advanced, though (to speak simply) he deserve more then as many of us as
there be in Arcadia: the prince him self has hidden his head, in such sort as
I told you, not sticking plainly to confess, that he

And now you know as much as my self: wherein if I have held you over long, lay
hardly the fault upon my old age, which in the very disposition of it is
talkatiue: whether it be (said he smiling) that nature loves to exercise that
part most, which is least decayed, and that is our tongue: or, that knowledge
being the only thing Palladius, that does not reverence that age, whose
heaviness, if it way down the frayl and fleshly balance, it as much lifts up
the noble and spiritual part: and well might you have alleged another reason,
that their wisdom makes them willing to profit But among many strange
conceits you told me, which have showed effects in your Prince, truly even
the last, that he should conceive such pleasure in shepherds discourses, would
not seem the least unto me, saving that you told me at the first, that this
country is notable in those wits, and that in deed my self having Strephon
and Claius, in their conference found wits as might better become such
shepheardes as Homer speaks of, that be governors of peoples, then such
senators who hold their council in a sheepecoate: for them two (said
Kalander) especially Claius, they are beeyond the rest by so much, as learning
commonly does add to nature: for, having neglected their wealth in respect of
their knowledge, they have not so much empayred

But certainly, all the people of this country from high to low, is given to
those Dametas will stumble sometimes upon some songs that might become a
better brain: Arcadia; and their conversation being well approved, the Prince
vouchsafes them his presence, and not only by looking on, but by great
courtesy and liberality, animates the shepheardes the more exquisitely to
labor for his good liking. So that there is no cause to blame the Prince for
sometimes hearing them; the blame-worthinesse is, that to Dametas is, since God
forbid, but where worthynesse is (as truly it is among diverse of that
fellowship) any outward lowness should hinder the hiest raising, but that he
would needs make election of one, the baseness of whose mind is such, that it
sinckes a thousand yet all honest hearts feel, that the trust of their Lord
goes beyond al advancement. But I am ever too long upon him, when he crosses
the way of my speech, and by the shadovve of yonder tovver, I see it is a
fitter time, with our supper to pay the duties we owe to our stomachs, then to
break the air with my idle discourses: And more wit I might have learned of
Homer (whom even now you mentioned) who Palladius through the gardeine again
to the parler, where they used to suppe; Palladius assuring him, that he had
already been more fed to his liking, the^ he could be by the skillfullest
trenchermen of Media.

But being come to the supping place, one of Kala^ders servants rou^ded in his
ear; at which (his color changing) he retired himself into his chamber;
commanding his men diligently to wait upon Palladius, and to excuse his
absence with some necessary business he had presently to dispatch. Which they
accordingly did, for some few days forcing themselves to let no change
appear, but though they framed their Palladius perceived there was some
ill-pleasing accident fallen out. Whereupon, being again set alone at supper,
he called to the Steward, and desired him to tell him the matter of his
sudden alteration: who after some trifling excuses, in the end confessed
unto him, that his master had received news, that his son before the day
of his near marriage, chaunst to be at a Helots: who winning the victory, he
was there made prisoner, going to deliver a friend of his taken prisoner by the
Helots; that the poor young Gentleman had offered great ransom for his life:
but that the hate those paysaunts conceived against all Gentlemen was such,
that every hour he was to look for nothing, Philanax the gonernour
refusing to deal in it as a private cause, but yet giving leave to seek their
best redress, so as they, wronged not the state of Lacedaemon) of whom there
were now gathered upon Clitophon. Now sir (said he) this is my masters
nature, though his grief be such, as to live is a grief unto him, and that
even his reason is darkened with sorrow; yet the laws of hospitality (long and
holily observed by him) give still such a sway to his proceeding, that he will
no way suffer the stranger lodged Palladius could scarce hear out his tale
with patience: so was his heart torn in pieces with compassion of the case,
liking of Kalanders noble behavior, kindness for his respect to him-warde,
and desire to find some remedy, beesides the Daiphantus, whom he judged to
suffer either alike or a worse fortune. Therefore rising from the boorde, he
desired the steward to tell him particularly, the ground and event of this
accident, because by knowledge of many circumstances, there might perhaps some
way of help be opened. Whereunto the Steward easily in this sort
condiscended.

My Lord (said he) when our good king Basilius, with better success then
expectation, Gynccia; there came with her a young Lord, cousin german to her
self, named Argalus, led hither, partly with the love and honor of his noble
kinswoman, partly with the humor of youth, which ever thinks that good,
whose goodness he sees not: and in this court he received so good increase of
knowledge, that after some years spent, Arcadia gloried such a plant was
transported unto them, being a Gentleman in deed most rarely accomplished,
excellently learned, but without all vain glory: friendly, without
factiousnes: valiant, so as for my part I think the earth has no man
that has done more heroical acts then he; howsoever now of late the same
Thessalia and Macedon, and has long done of our noble prince Amphialus: who
indeed, in our parts is only accounted likely to match him: but I say for my
part, I think no man for valor of mind, and ability of body to be
preferred, if equalled to Argalus; and yet so valiant as he never durst do any
body injury: in behavior some will say ever sad, surely sober, and
somewhat given to musing, but never discourteous; his word ever led Argalus,
Chlitophon (whose loss gives the cause to this discourse, and yet gives me
cause to begin with Argalus. Argalus) being a young Gentleman, as of great
birth (being our kings sisters son) so truly of good nature, and one that
can see good and love it, haunted more the company of this worthy Argalus,
then of any other: so as if there were not a friendship (which is so rare, as
it is to be doubted whether it be a thing in deed ^or but a word) at least
there was such Parthenia; fair in deed (fame I think it self daring not to
call any fairer, if it be not Helena queen of Corinth and the two incomparable
sisters of Arcadia) and that

I think you think, that these perfections meeting, could not choose but find
one another, and delight in that they found; for likeness of manners is likely
in reason to draw liking with affection. men's actions do not always cross
with reason: to beshorte, it did so in deed. They loved, though for a while the
fire thereof (hopes wings being cut of) were blowe^ by the bellows of despair
upon this ocasio^.

There had been a good while before, and so continued, a suter to this same
lady, Parthenias mother, named Demagoras: A man mighty in riches and power,
and proud thereof, stubbornly stout, loving no body but him self, and for
his own delights sake Parthenia: and pursuing vehemently his desire, his
riches had gilded over all his other imperfections, that the old Lady
(though contrary to my Lord her brothers Clitophon brought this noble Argalus,
perchance principally to see so rare a sight, as Parthenia by all

But though few days were before the time of assurance appointed, yet love
that saw he had a great journey to make in short time, hasted so him self,
that before her word could tie her to Demagoras, her heart had vowed her to
Argalus, with so grateful a receipte in mutual affection, that if she
desired above all Argalus, Argalus feared nothing but to miss Parthenia. And
now Parthenia had learned both lyking and misliking, loving and lothing, and
out of passion began to take the authority of judgment; in so much, that when
the time came that Demagoras (full of proud joy) though to receive the gift of
her own self, she with words of resolute refusal (though^ with tears
showing she was sorry Demagoras. The change was no more strange, then
unpleasant to the mother: who being determynatelye (least I should say of a
great Lady wilfully) bent to mary her to Demagoras, tried all ways which a
witty and hard hearted mother could use, upon so humble a daughter: in whom
the only Parthenia to defend: and the more Parthenia defended, the more she
made her mother obstinate in the assault: who at the length finding, that
Argalus standing between them, was it that most eclipsed her affection from
shining upon Demagoras, she sought al means how to remove him, so much the
more, as he manifested himself Juno recommended to the famous Hercules: but the
more his virtue was tried, the more pure it grew, while all the things she did
to overthrow him, did set him up upon the hight of honor; enough to have
moved her heart, especially to a man every way so worthy as Argalus: but
Demagoras, the more virtuous Argalus was, the more she hated him: thinking her
self conquered in his conquestes, and therefore still employing him in more and
more dangerous attempts: in the mean while, she used all extremities possible
upon her fair daughter, to make her give over herself to her direction.
Argalus the world sooner wanted occasions, then he valor to go through them;
so to Parthenia, malice sooner ceased, then her unchanged patience. Lastly, by
treasons, Demagoras and she would have made away Argalus: but he with
providence and courage so past over all, that the mother took such a spiteful
grief at it, that her heart brake withal, and she died.

But then, Demagoras assuring him self, that now Parthenia was her own, she
Argalus, whom he saw with narrow eyes, even ready to enjoy the perfection of
his desires; strengthening his conceit with all the mischievous counsels which
disdained love, and envious pride could give unto him; the wicked wretch
(taking a time that Argalus was gone to Parthenia had most joyfully consented
unto,) the wicked Demagoras (I say) desiring to speak with her, with
unmerciful force, (her weak arms in vain resisting) rubd all over her face
a most horrible poison: the effect whereof was such, that never leaper looked
more ugly then she did: which done, having his men and horses ready, Kalander,
he made such means, both by our kings intercession, and his own, that by the
king, and Senate of Lacedaemon, Demagoras was upon pain of death, banished the
country: who hating the punishment, where he should have hated the fault,
Helots, lately in rebellion against that state: and they (glad to have a man of
such authority among them) made him their general: and under him have committed
diverse the most outrageous villainies, that a base multitude (full of desperate
revenge) can imagine.

But within a while after this pitiful fact committed upon Parthenia, Argalus
returned Argalus, that not only in such comfort Demagoras, because he might
continually be in her presence; showing more humble seruiceablenes, and joy to
content her, then ever before.

But as he gave this rare ensample, not to be hoped for of any other, but of an
other Argalus: so of the other side, she took as strange a course in
affection: for, where she kindly buyld a resolution never to have him: for
truth is, that so in heart she loved him, as she could not find in her heart
he should be tied to what was unworthy of his presence.

Truly Sir, a very good Orator might have a fair field to use eloquence in,
if he did but only repeat the lamentable, and truly affectionated speeches,
while he Argalus to such a Parthenia: Live happy, dear Argalus, I give you full
liberty, and I beseech you take it; and I assure you I shall rejoice
(whatsoever become of

But Argalus with a most heavy heart still pursuing his desire, she fixed of
mind to avoid further entreaty, and to fly all company; which (even of him)
grew unpleasant

Argalus sought her long, and in many places: at length (despairing to find
her, and the more he despaired, the more enraged) weerie of his life, but first
determining to be revenged of Demagoras, he went alone disguysed into the
chief Helots: where coming into his presence, guarded about by many of his
soldiers, he could delay his fury no longer for a fitter time: but setting
upon him, in despite of a great many that helped him, gave him diverse mortal
wounds, and him self (no question) had been there presently murdered, but
that Demagoras himself desired he might be kept alive; perchance with
intention to Lacedaemon, where he should have suffered death for having slain
the kings Nephew: but him he named, who at that time was absent, making roades
upon the Lacedaemonians, but Helots, for the great liking they conceived of
that yongman, especially because they had none among themselves to whom the
others would yield) were content to follow Demagoras apppointment. And well has
it succeeded with the^, he having since done things beyond the hope of the
youngest heads of whom I speak the rather, because he has hitherto pre^erued
Argalus alive, under pretense to have him publicly, and with exquisite
torments executed,

And he has likewise hitherto kept my young Lord Clitophon alive, who (to
redeem his friend) went with certain other noblemen of Laconia, and forces
gathered by them, to besiege this young and new successor: but he issuing out
(to the Laconians, slew many of the noblemen, and took Clitophon prisoner,
whom with much a do he keeps alive: the Helots being villanously cruel; but
he tempereth them so sometimes by following their humor, sometimes by striving
with it, that hitherto he has saved both their lives, but in different
estates; Argalus being kept in a close and hard prison, Clitophon at some
liberty. Helots hands, I have delivered all I understand touching the loss
of my Lords son, and the cause thereof: which, though it was not necessary
to Clitophons case, to be so particularly told, yet the strangenes of it, made
me think it would not be unpleasant unto you.

Palladius thanked him greatly for it, being even passionatly delighted with
hearing so strange an accident of a knight so famous over the world, as
Argalus, with whom he had him self a long desire to meet: so had fame poured
a noble emulation in him, toward him.

But the^ (well bethinking himself) he called for armor, desiring them to
provide Kala^der, whom he found lying upon the ground, having euersince
banished both sleep and food, as enemies to the mourning which passion
persuaded him was reasonable. But Palladius raised him up, saying unto him: No
more, no more of this, my Lord Kalander; let us labor to find, before we
lament the loss: you know my self miss Kallanders spirits were so revived
withal, that (receiving some sustenance, Palladius to the place upon the
frontiers: where already there were assembled between three and four thousand
men, all well disposed (for Kalanders sake) to abide any peril: but like men
disused with a long peace, more determinate to do, then skillful how to do:
lusty bodies, and brave armours: Palladius soon perceiving, he desired to
understand (as much as could be delivered unto him) the estate of the Helots.

the Lacedaemonians had conquered them, and laid, not only tribute, but
bondage upon them: which they had long borne: till of late the Lacedaemonians
through greediness growing more heavy then they could bear, and through
contempt less careful how to make them bear, they had with a general
consent (rather springing by the generalnes of the cause, then of any
artificial practice) set Lacedaemonians and more of late then ever; by reason,
first of Demagoras a great Lord, who had made him self of their party, and
since his death, of an other Captain they had gotten, who had brought up their
ignorance, and brought down their fury, to such a mean of good government,
and withal led them so valorously, that (besides the Clitophon was taken)
they had the better in some other great conflicts: in such wise, that the
estate of Lacedaemon had sent unto them, offering peace with most reasonable
and honorable conditions. Palladius having gotten this general knowledge of
the party against whom, as he had already of the party for whom he was to
fight, he went to Kalander, and told him plainly, that by plain force
Clitophon: but some device was to be taken in hand, wherein no less
discretion then valor was to be used.

Whereupon, the counsel of the chief men was called, and at last, this way
Palladius (who by some experience, but especially by reading Histories, was
acquainted with stratagemes) invented, and was by all the rest approved: that
Arcadia, having no banners, but bloody shirtes hanged upon long staves, with
some bad bag pipes in stead of drum and fife, their armor they should
as well as might be, cover, or at least make them look so rustilie, and
ill-fauouredly as might well become such wearers; and this the whole number
should do, Palladius him self would be one, who should have their arms
chayned, and be put in carts like prisoners. This being performed according to
the agreement, they marched on toward the town of Cardamila where Clitophon
was captive; and being come two hours before Sunne-set within view of the
walls, Helots already descrying their number, and beginning to sound the
Allarum, they sent a cunning fellow, (so much the cunninger as that he could
mask it under rudenes) who with such a kind of Rhetorike, as weeded out all
flowers of Rhetorike, delivered unto the Helots assembled together, that they
were country people of Arcadia, no less oppressed by their Lords, and no
less desirous of liberty Arcadia, and were not yet of number enough to keep
the field against their Princes forces they were come to them for succor;
knowing, that daily more and more of their quality them, or the Lacedaemonian
King and Nobility (for the likeness of the cause) fall upon them, they desired
that if there were not room enough for them in the town, that yet they might
encampe under the walls, and for surety have their prisoners (who were such
men as were ever able to make their peace) kept within the town.

Helots made but a short co^sultatio^, being glad that their contagio^ had
spread it self into Arcadia, and making account that if the peace did not fall
out between them and their King, that it was the best way to set fire in all
the parts of Greece; besides their greediness to have so many Gentlemen in
their hands, in whose raunsomes they already meant to have a share; to which
have of concluding, two Lacedaemon: the second, that ouer-many good fortunes
began to breed a proud recklesnesse in them: therefore sending to view the
camp, and finding that by their speech they were Arcadians, with whom they had
had no war, never suspecting Palladius seeing fit time, Arcadians before the
Helots could make any head to resist

But the Helots being men hardened against dangers, gathered (as well as they
could) together in the market place, and thence would have given a shrewd
welcome to the Arcadians, but that Palladius (blaming those that were slow,
hartning them that were forward, but especially with his own ensample leading
them) Helots, that at first the great body of them beginning to shake, and
stagger; at length, every particular body recommended the protection of his
life to his feet, Then Kalander cried to go to the prison, where he thought
his son was, but Palladius wished him (first scouring the streates) to house
all the Helots, and make themselves masters of the gates,

Helots had gotten new heart, and with diverse sorts of shot from corners of
streates, and house windows, galled them; which courage was come unto them by
the return of their Captain; who though he brought not many with him (having
dispersed most of his companies to other of his holds) yet meeting a great
number running out of the gate, not yet possessed by the Arcadians, he made them
turn face, and with banners displayed, his Trumpet gave the lowdest testimony
he could of his return, which once heard the rest of the Helots which were
otherwise scattered, bent thetherwarde, with a new life of resolution: as if
their Captain had been a root, out of which (as into branches) their
courage had sprung. Then began the fight to grow most sharp, and the
encounters Arcadians fighting to keep that they had won, the Helots to
recover what they had lost. The Arcadians, as in an unknown place, having no
succor but in their hands; the Helots, as in their own place fighting for
their livings, wives and children. There was victory and courage against
revenge and despair: safety of both sides being no otherwise to be gotten,
but by destruction.

At length, the left winge of the Arcadians began to loose ground; which
Palladius seeing, he straight thrust himself with his choice band against the
throng that oppressed Helots (whose eyes soon judged of that wherewith
themselves were governed) saw that he alone was worth all the rest of the
Arcadians. Which he so wondered at, that it was hard to say, whether he more
liked his doings, or misliked the effects of his doings: but determining that
upon that cast the game lay, and disdaining to fight with any other, Palladius,
having easily marked, that he was as the first mouer of all the other hands.
And so their thoughts meeting in one point, they consented (though not agreed)
to try each others fortune: and so drawing themselves to be the uttermost of
the one side, they began a combat, which was so much inferior to the battle
in noise and number, as Helots with a blow, whose violence grew of fury, not
of strength, or ofstrength proceeding of fury, struck Palladius upon the side
of the head, that he reelde astonished: and with all the helmet fell off, he
remaining bare headed: but other of the Arcadians were ready to shield him from
any harm might rise of that nakedness.

But little needed it, for his chief enemy in steed of pursuing that
advantage, kneeled down, offering to deliver the pommell of his sword, in
token of yielding, with all speaking aloud unto him, that he thought it more
liberty to be his prisoner, then any others general. Palladius standing upon
himself, and misdoubting some craft, and the Helots (that were next their
captain) wavering between looking for Palladius forgotten the voice of
Daiphantus?

By that watch word Palladius knew that it was his only friend Pyrocles,
whom he had lost upon the Sea, and therefore both most full of wonder, so to
be met, if they had not been fuller of joy then wonder, caused the retraite
to be sounded, Daiphantus by authority and Palladius by persuasion; to which
helped well the little advantage that was of either side: and that of the
Helots party their Captains behavior had made as many amazed as saw or
heard of it: and of the Arcadian side the good old Kalander striving more then
his old age could atchiue, was newly taken prisoner. But in deed the chief
parter of the fraye was the night, which with her Kalander, meant nothing less
then to save him, but only so long, as the Captain might learn the enemies
secrets: toward whom he led the old Gentleman, when he caused the retreit to
be sounded: looking for no other delivery from that captivity, but by the
painful taking away of all pain: when whom should he see next to the
Captain (with good tokens how valiantly he had fought that Arcadians) but his
son Clitophon? But now the Captain had caused all the principal Helots to
be assembled, as well to deliberate what they had to do, as to receive a
message from the Arcadians; Among whom Palladius virtue (besides the love
Kalander bare him) having gotten principal authority, he had persuaded them
to seek rather by parley to recover the Father and the Son, then Clitophon,
so offering to leave the footing, they already had in the town, to go away
without any further hurt, so as Helots, Daiphantus persuaded them without
delay to accept them. For first (said he) since the strife is within our own
home, if you loose, you loose all that in this life can be dear unto you: if
you win, it will be a blouddy victory with no profit, but the flattering in
our selves Arcadia upon us, which now, by using these persons well, may be
brought to some amity. Lastly but especially, least the king and nobility of
Laconia (with whom now we have made a perfect peace) should hope by occasion
of this quarrel to join the Arcadians with them, and so break of the
profitable agreement already concluded. In

The Helots as much moved by his authority, as persuaded by his reasons, were
content therewith. Whereupon, Palladius took order that the Arcadians should
presently march out of the town, taking with them their prisoners, while the
night Kalander and Clitophon, who now (with infinite joy did know each other)
came to kiss the hands and feet of Daiphantus: Clitophon telling his father,
Daiphantus (not without danger to himself) had preserved him from the furious
malice of the Helots: and even that day going to conclude the peace (least in
his absence he might receive some hurt) he had taken him in his company, and
given him armor, upon promise he should take the part of the Helots; which he
had in his fight performed, little knowing that it was against his father: but
(said Clitophon) here is he, who (as a father) has new-begotten me, and (as a
God) has saved me from many deaths, which already laid hold on me: which
Kalander with tears of joy acknowledged (besides his own deliverance) only
his benefit. But Daiphanius, who loved doing well for it self, and not for
thanks, brake of those ceremonies, desiring to know how Palladius (for so he
called Musidorus) was come into Kalander, he sent him word by Clitophon, that
he should not as now come unto him, because he held himself not so sure a
master of the Helots minds, that he would adventure him in their power, who
was so welknowen with an unfriendly acquaintce, but that he desired him to
return with Kalander, whether also he within few days (having dispatched
himself of the Helots) would repair. Kalander would needs kiss his hand
again for that promise, protesting he would esteem his house more blessed
then a temple of the gods, if it had once received him. And Argalus. Daiphantus
assured them that he would dye but he would bring him, (though till then kept
in close prison, indeed for his safety, the Helots being so animated against
him as else he could not have lived) and so taking their leave of him, Kalander,
Clitophon, Palladius and the rest of the Arcadians swearing that they would no
further in any sort molest the Helots, Arcadia.

The Helots of the other side shutting their gates, gave the^selus to burye
their dead to cure their wounds, and rest their wearied bodies: til (the next
day bestowing the cheerful use of the light upon them) Daiphan^us making a
general convocation Arcadia, or from the Nobility of this Country (who would
have made fruits of wisdom grow out of this occasion) we should have had our
power turned to ruin, our pride to repentance and sorrow. But now the
Clitophon more hardly then his age or quarrel deserved, becomes a sharply
learned experience, to use in other times more moderation.

Now have I to deliver unto you the conclusion between the kings with the
Nobility of Lacedaemon, and you; which is in all points as your selves
desired: as well Laconians do: Your selves are made by public decree,
freemen, and so capable both to give and receive voice in election of Helots
and Lacedaemonians to be quite taken away, and all indifferently to enjoy both
names and privileges of Laconians. Your children to be brought up with theirs
in the Spartane discipline: and so you (framing your selves to be good members
of that estate) to be hereafter fellows, and no longer servants.

Which conditions you see, carry in themselves no more contentation then
assurance. For this is not a peace which is made with them, but this is a peace
by which you are made of them. Lastly a forgetfulness decreed of all what is
past, they showing them selves glad to have so valiant men as you are, joined
with them so that you are to take minds of peace, since the cause of war is
finished; and as you hated may not repent your joining. But now one Article
only they stood upon, which in the end I with your commissioners have agreed
unto, that I should no more tarry here, mistaking perchance my humor, and
thinking me as seditious as I am young, or else it is the king Amiclas
procuring, in respect that it was my ill hap Eurileon; but how so ever it be; I
have condiscended. But so will not we cried almost the whole assembly,
councelling one an other, rather to try the uttermost event, then to loose him
by whom they had been victorious. But he as well with general orations, as
particular dealing with the men of most credit, made them thoroughly see how
necessary it was to prefer such an opportunity Lacedaemonians brake this
treaty) come back again, and be their captain.

So then after a few days, setting them in perfect order, he took his leave
of them, whose eyes bad him farewell with tears, and mouths with kissing the
places Argalus, whom also (upon oath never to bear arms against the Helots)
he delivered: and taking only with him certain principal Jewels of Argalus,
(whose countenance well showed, while Parthenia was lost he counted not
himself delivered) but that the whole multitude would needs guard him into
Arcadia. Where again leaving them all to lament his departure, he by inquiry
got to the well-knowne house of Kalander: There was he received with loving
joy of Kalander, with ioyefull love Palladius, with humble (though doleful)
demeanor of Argalus (whom specially both he and Palladius regarded) with
grateful seruisablenes of Clitophon, and honorable admiration of all. For
being now well veiwed to have no hair of his face, to witness him a man, who
had done acts beyond the degree of a man, and to look with a certain almost
b^shfull kind of modesty, as if he feared the eyes Marses heart in a Cupids
body: All that beheld him (and all that might behold him, did behold him) made
their eyes quick messengers to their minds, that there they had seen the
uttermost that in mankind might be seen. The like wonder Palladius had
Daiphantus, as younger and newer come, had gotten now the advantage in the
moist and ^icle impression of eyesight. But while all men (saving poor
Argalus) made the joy of their eyes speak for their hearts toward Daiphantus:
Fortune (that belike was bid to that banquet, and meant then to play the good
fellow) brought a pleasant adventure among them. It was that as they had
Kalander a messenger, that brought him word, a young noble Lady, near kinswoman
to the fair Helen Queen of Corinth; was come thither, and desired to be
lodged in his house. Kalander (most glad of such an occasion-went out, and all
his other worthy guests with him, saving only Argalus, who remained in his
chamber, desirous that this company were once broken up, that Parthen^a. But
when they met this Lady; Kalander straight thought he saw his niece
Parthenea, and was about in such familiar sort to have spoken unto her: But
she in grave and honorable manner giving him to understand that he was
mistaken, he half ashamed excused himself with the exceeding likeness was
between them, though in deed it seemed that this Lady was of the more pure and
dainty complexion; she said, it might very well be, having been many times
taken one for another. But as soon as Argalus publicly, who she heard was in
the house. Argalus came hastily, and as hastily thought as Kalander had done,
with sudden chaunges of joy into sorrow. But she when she had staide their
thoughts with telling them her name, and quality in this sort spoke unto him.
My Lord Argalus, said she, being of late left Helen of Corinth, as chief in
her absence (she being upon some occasion gone thence) there came unto me the
Lady Parthenia. so disfigured, as I think Greece has nothing so ougly to
behold. For my part, it was many days, before with vehement oaths, and some
good proofs, she could make me think that she was Parthenia. Yet at last
finding certainlye it was she, and greatly Argalus: which whosoever loves not,
shows himself to be a hater of virtue, and unworthy to live Argalus his
answer, who first making most hearty sighs do such obsequies as he could, to
Parthenia thus answered her.

Madame (said he) infinitely am I bound unto you, for this, no more rare then
Parthenia, (with that the tears ran down his eyes; but he followed on) and
as much as so unfortunate a man, fit to be the spectacle of misery, can do
you service; determine you have made a purchase of a slave (while I live) never
to fail you. But this great matter you propose unto me, wherein I am not so
blind as Parthenias it is though dead: there I began, there I end all matter
of affection: I hope I shall not long tarry after her, with whose beauty if I
had only been in love, I should be so with Parthenias self Lloued, and love;
which no likeness can make one; no commandment dissolve, no foulnes defile, nor
no death finish. And shall I receive (said she) such disgrace, as to be
refused? Noble Lady (said he) let not that hard word be used; who know your
exceeding worthiness far beyond my desert: but it is only happiness I
refufe, since of the only happiness I could and can desire, I am refused.

He had scarce spoken those words, when she ran to him, and embracing him,
Argalus (said she) take thy Parthenia; and Parthenia it was in deed. But
because sorrow forbad him too soon to believe, she told him the truth, with all
circumstances; how being parted alone, meaning to die in some solitary place,
as she happened to make her complaint, the Queen Helen of Corinth, (who likewise
felt her part of miseries) being then walking also alone in that lonely place,
heard her Parthenia, or no. Her speech was confirmed by the Corinthian
Gentlemen, who before had kept her council, and Argalus easily persuaded to
what more then ten thousand years of life he desired: and Kalander would
needs have the marriage celebrated in his house, principally the longer to
hold his dear guestes, toward whom he was now (besides his

But no way he saw he could so much pleasure them as by leaving the two
friends alone, who being shruncke aside to the banqueting house where the
pictures were; there Palladius recounted unto him, that after they had
btahba^do^ed the burni^g ship (and either of them taken some thing under him
the better to support him to the Pyrocles: to which purpose Kalander by
Messena, had already set a ship or two abroad, when this accident of
Clitophons taking had so blessedly procured their meeting. Then did he
setfoorth unto him the noble intertainment and careful cherishing of Kalander
toward him, and so upon occasion of the pictures present delivered with the
franknes of a friends tongue, as near as he could, word by word what Kalander
had told him touching the strange story (with all the particularities
belonging) of Arcadia, Pyrocles to hear; that he would needs have much of it
again repeated, and was not contented till Kalander himself had answered him
diverse questions.

But first at Musidorus request, though in brief manner, his mind much running
Arcadia, he did declare by what course of adventures he was com to make up
their mutual happiness in meeting. When (cousin said he) we had stripped our
selves, and were both leapt into the Sea, and swom a little toward the shore, I
found by reason of some wounds I had, that I should not be able to get the
land, and therefore turned back again to the most of the ship, where you
found me, assuring my self, that if you came alive to shore, you would seek
me; if you were lost, as I thought it as good to perish as to live, so that
place as good to perish in as an other. There I found my sword among some of
the Lacedaemon having set out some Galleys, under the charge of one of their
Nephews to skowre the Sea of the Pirates, they met with us, where our Captain
wanting men, was driven to arm some of his prisoners, with promise of liberty
for well fighting: among whom I was one, and being boorded by the Admiral, it
was my fortune to Euryleon the Kings nephew: but in the end they prevailed,
and we were all taken prisoners: I not caring much what became of me (only
keeping the name of Daiphantus, according to the resolution you know is
between us,) but being laid in the iayle of Tenaria, with special hate to me
for the death of Euryleon, the popular sort of that town conspired with the
Helots, and so by night opened them the Lacedaemon, their chief Captain being
slain as you know by the noble Argalus, who helped thereunto by his
persuasion) having borne a great affection unto me, and to avoid the
dangerous emulation which grew among the chief, who should have the place,
and also affected, as rather to have a stranger then a competitour, they
elected me, (God worte Lacedaemonians, they had gotten in the sack of the
town. Now being in it, so good was my success with many victories, that I
made a peace for them to their own liking? the very day that Clitophon, whom
I with much a do had preserved. And in my peace the King Amiclas of
Lacedaemon would needs have me bannished, and deprived of the dignity
whereunto I was exalted: which (and you may see how much you are bound to
me) for your sake I was content to suffer, a new hope rising in me, that you
were not dead: and so meaning to travail Musidorus) you have me. And with
that (embracing and kissinge each other) they called Kalander, of whom
Daiphantus desired to hear the full story, which before he had recounted to
Palladius, and to see the letter of Philanax, which he read and well marked.

But within some days after, the marriage between Argalus and the fair
Parthenia being to be celebrated Daiphantus and Palladius selling some of
their Jewels Parthenia, the pearl of all the maids of Mantinaea: who as she
went to the Temple to be married, her eyes themselves seemed a temple, wherein
love and beauty were married: her lips though they were kept close with
modest silence, yet with a pretty kind of natural swelling, they seemed to
inuit the guestes that looked on them; her cheeks blushing, and withal when
she was spoken unto, a little smilyng, were like roses^ Daiphantus marking
her, to Jupiter (said he speaking to Palladius) how happens it, that beauty
is only confined to Arcadia? But Palladius not greatly attending his speech,
some days were continued in the solemnising the marriage, with all conceits

But such a change was grown in Daiphantus, that (as if cheerfulness had
been tediousness, and good entertainment were turned to discourtesie) he would
ever get himself alone, though almost when he was in company, he was alone, so
little attentio^ he gave to any that spoke unto him: even the color and figure
of his face began to receive Palladius, whom true love made ready to mark, and
long knowledge able to mark; and therefore being now grown weary of his abode
in Arcadia, having informed him

A mind well trained and long exercised in virtue (my sweet and worthy cousin)
does not easily change any course it once undertakes, but upon well grounded
and Pyrocles) the excellency of whose mind and well chosen course in virtue,
if I do not sufficiently know, having seen such rare demonstrations of it, it
is my weakness, and not your unworthiness, But as in deed I know it, and
knowing it most dearly love both it, and him that has it; so must I needs
say, that since our late coming into this country, I have marked in you, I
will not say an alteration, but a relenting truly, and a slacking of the
maine career, you had so notablye begone and almost performed; Pyrocles mind
was all this while so fixed upon another devotion, that he no more attentively
marked his friends discourse, then the child that has leave to play, marks
the last part Musidorus, in the praise you gave me in the beginning of your
speech, I easily acknowledge the force of your good will unto me, for neither
could you have thought so well of me, if extremity of love had not made your
judgment partial, nor you could have loved me so entirely, if you had not
been apt to make so great (though undeserved) judgments of me;

And in such contemplation, or as I think more excellent, I enjoy my
solitarines; ways heard together; condemn not therefore my mind sometime to
enjoy it self; nor blame not the taking of such times as serve most fit for
it. And alas, dear Musidorus, if I be sad, who knows better then you the
just causes I have of sadness? And here Pyrocles suddenly stopped, like a man
unsatisfied in himself, though Echo thereof a perfect Music? and these
fresh and delightful brooks how slowly they slide away, as loath to leave the
company of so many Musidorus as more desirous of pity then pleading. But
Musidorus had all this while held his look fixed upon Pyrocles countenance;
and with no less loving attention marked how his words proceeded from him:
but in both these he perceived such strange diversities, that they rather
increased new doubts, then gave him ground to settle any Musidorus frame his
answer nearest to that humor, which should soonest put out the secret. For
having in the beginning of Pyrocles speech which defended his solitarines,
framed in his mind a reply against it, in the praise of honorable action,
which knowledge was the only way to increase the one, and correct the other:
besides many other arguments, which the plentifulnesse of the matter yielded
to the sharpnes of his wit. When he found Pyrocles leave that, and fall into
such an affected praising of the place, he left it likewise, and joined with
him therein: because he found him in that humor utter more store of passion;
and even thus kindly Pyrocles Macedon you should either se many heavens or
find this no more then earthly. And even Tempe in my Thessalia (where you and
I to my great happiness were brought up together) is nothing inferior unto
it. Pyrocles, then the right tune of music touches him that is sick of the
Tarantula. There was not one part of his body, that did not feel a sudden
motion, while his heart with panting, seemed to dance to the sound of that
word, yet after some pause (lifting up his eyes a little from the ground, and
yet not daring to place them in the Musidorus) armed with the very conntenance
of the poor prisoner at the bar, whose answer is nothing but guilty: with
much a do he brought forth this question. And alas, said he, dear cousin, what
if I be not so much the Poet (the freedom of whose pen can exercise it
self in any thing) as even that miserable subject of his conning, whereof you
speak? Now the eternal Gods forbid Musidorus) that ever my care should be
poisoned with so evil news of you. O let me never know that any base affection
should get any Lordship in your thoughts. But as he was speaking more, Kalander
came, and brake of their discourse, with inuiting them to the hunting of a
goodly stagge, which being harbored in a wood thereby, he hoped would make
them good sport, and drive Daiphantus melancholy. They condiscended, and so
going to their lodgings, furnished them selves as liked them Daiphantus writing
a few words which he left sealed in a letter against their return.

Then went they together abroad, the good Kala^der entertaining the^ with
pleasant discoursing, how well he loved the sport of hunting when he was a
young man, one thinks too much of his doing, he leaves to do the effect of
his thinking. Then spared he not to remember how much Arcadia was changed
since his youth: actiuitie and good fellowship being nothing in the price, it
was then held in, but according to the nature of the old growing world, still
worse and worse. Then Echo left to bewail the loss of Narcissus, and became a
hunter. But the

Kalander (by his skill of coasting the Country) was among the first that came
in to the besieged Dear; whom when some of the younger sort would have killed
with their swords, he would not suffer: but with a Crossebowe sent a death to
the poor beast, who with tears showed the unkindness he took of man's cruelty.

But by the time that the whole company was assembled, and that the Sagge
had Daiphantus was mist, for whom Palladius carefully enquiring, no nevves
could be given him, but by one that said, he thought he was returned home;
for that he marked him, in the chief of the hunting, take a by way, which
might lead to Kalanders house. That answer for the time satisfying, and they
having performed all duties, as well for the Daiphantus was not to be found.
Whereat Palladius greatly maruailing, and a day or two passing, while neither
Pyrocles had written before he went a hunting, and left in his study among
other of his vvritings. The letter was directed to Palladius himself, and
contained these words.

My only friend, violence of love leads me into such a course, whereof your
knowledge may much more vex you, then help me. Therefore pardon my concealing
it from you, since: if I wrong you, it is in the respect I bear you. Return
into Thessalia, I pray you, as full of good fortune, as I am of desire: and if
I live, I will in

This was all, and this Palladius read twice or thrice over. Ah (said he)
Pyrocles, what means this alteration? what have I deserved of thee, to be
thus banished of thy counsels? Heretofore I have accused the sea, condemned the
Pirates, and hated my evil fortune, that deprived me of thee; But now thy self
is the sea, which drounes Pyrocles: for he was not so sure by his words, that
it was love, as he was doubtful where the love was. One time he thought, some
beauty in Laconia had laid hold of his eyes; an other time he feared, that
it Parthenias excellency, which had broken the bands of al former resolution
But the more he thought, the more he knew not what to think, armies of
objections rising against any accepted opinion.

Then as careful he was what to do himself: at length determined, never to
leave seeking him, till his search should be either by meeting accomplished,
or by Kalander, and told him, that he had received a message from his friend,
by which he understood he was gone back again into Laconia, about some
matters greatly importing the poor men, whose protection he had undertaken,
and that it was in any sort Kalander: which he did partly to give the more
cause to Kalander Palladius told him that the matter was not so secret, but
that so worthy a friend deserved the knowledge, and should have it as soon as
he might speak with his friend: without whose consent Daiphantus and
Palladius, would give him and his cause to think his noble courtesy well
employed. Kalander would press him no further: but desiring that he might have
leave to go, or at least to send his son and servants Palladius brake of
all ceremonies, by telling him; his case stood so, that his greatest favor
should be in making lest adoo of his parting. Wherewith Kalander knowing it to
be more cumber then courtesy, to st^iue, abstained from further urging him,
but not from hearty mourning the loss of so sweet a conversation.

Only Clitophon by vehement importunity obtained to go with him, to come
again to Daiphantus, whom he named and accounted his Lord. And in such
Palladius, though having a companion to talk withal, yet talking much more
with unkindness. And first they went to Mantinaea; whereof because Parthenia was,
he suspected there might be some cause of his abode. But finding there no news
of him he went to Tegaea, Ripa, Enispae, Stimpahlus, and Pheneus, famous for
the poisonous Stygian water, and through all the rest of Arcadia, Clitophon
espied a piece of armor, and not far of an other piece: and so the sight of
one piece teaching him to look for more he Amphialus. Whereupon (fearing some
inconvenience happened unto him) he told both his doubt and cause of doubt to
Palladius, who (considering thereof) Amphialus, Palladius thought best to take
that armor, thinking thereby to learn by them that should know that armor,
some news Amphialus, and yet not hinder him in the search of Daiphantus too.
So he by the help of Clitophon quickly put on that armor, whereof there was
no one piece wanting, though hacked in some places, bewraying some fight not
long since passed. It was something to great, but yet served well enough. And
so getting on their horses, they travailed but a little way, when in opening of
the mouth of the valley Palladius not accustomed to grant over the possession
of him self upon so unjust titles, with sword drawn gave them so rude an
answer, that diverse of them never had breath to reply again: for being well
backed by Clitophon, and having an excellent horse under him, when he was
ouerprest by some, he avoided them, and ere the other thought of it, punished in
him his fellows faults: and so either with cunning or with force, or rather
with a cunning force, left none of them either living, or able to make his life
serve to others hurt. Which being done, he approached the coach, assuring the
black boys they should have no Amphialus the Lord of her desires, (blood
coming more freely into her cheeks, as though it would be bold, and yet
there growing new again pale for fear) with a pitiful look (like on unjustly
condemned) My Lord Amphialus said she you have enough punished me: it is time
for cruelty to leave you, and evil fortune me; if not I pray you, (and to
grant, my prayer fitter time nor place you can Palladius could not hold her
longer in error, but pulling of his helmet, Madam (said he) I perceive you
mistake me: I am a stranger in these parts, set upon (without any cause given
by me) by some of your servants, whom because I have in my just defense
Palladius assured her it was not so; telling her the true manner how he found
it. It is like enough (said she) for that agrees with the manner he has
lately used. But I beseech you Sir (said she) since your prowes has bereft me
of my company: so much worthiness, which I am glad even to rocks and woods to
utter. Know you then that my name is Helen, Queen by birth: and hitherto
possession of the fair city and territory of Corinth. I can say no more of
my self, but beloved of my people: and may justly say, beloved, since they are
content to bear with my abse^ce,

Among the rest, or rather before the rest, was the Lord Philoxenus, son and
heir to the virtuous noble man Timotheus: which Timotheus was a man both in
power, riches, parentage, and (which passed all these) goodness, and (which
followed

But whiles Philoxenus in good sort pursued my favor, and perchance nourished
himself with over much hope, because he found I did in some sort acknowledge
Palladius greatly pitying so sweet a sorrow in a Lady, whom by fame he had
already known, and honored, Amphialus: what need I say more to you? what
ear is so barbarous but has hard of Amphialus? who follows deeds of arms,
but every where finds momuments of Amphialus? who is courteous, noble,
liberal, but he that has the example before his eyes of Amphialus? Amphialus?
O Amphialus I would thou were not so excellent, or I would I thought thee not
so excellent, and yet would I not that I would so^ with that she wept again,
till he again soliciting the conclusion of her story: Then must you (said
she) know the story of Amphialus: for his will Amphialus?

This Knight then whose figure you see, but whose mind can be painted by
nothing, but by the true shape of virtue, is brothers son to Basilius King of
Arcadia, and in his childhood esteemed his heir: till Basilius in his old
years marrying

Whereupon his mother (a woman of a hauti^ heart, being daughter to the King
of Argos, either disdaining, or fearing, that her son should live under the
power of Basilius sent him to that Lord Timotheus (between whom and her dead
husband there had passed straight bands of mutual hospitality to be brought up
in company with his son Philoxenus?

A happy resolution for Amphialus, whose excellent nature was by this means
Timotheus) no less loving him then his own son: well they grew in years;
and shortly occasions fell aptly to try Amphialus, and all occasions were but
steps for him to clime fame by. Nothing Amphialus. An endless thing it were
for me to tell, how many adventures (terrible to be spoken of) he achieved:
what monsters, what Giants, what conquests Philoxenus: between whom, and him,
so fast a frindship by educatio^ was knit, that at last Philoxenus having no
greater matter to imploye his frindshipp in, then to win me, therein desired,
and had his uttermost furtheraunce: to that purpose brought he him to my court,
where truly I may justly witness Philoxenus: my ears could hear nothing from
him, but touching the worthiness of Philoxenus, and of the great happiness it
would be unto me to have such a husband: with many arguments, which God
knows, I cannot well Philoxenus, why sure (said I to my self) Helen, be not
afraid, this heart cannot want pity: and when Philoxenus, who indeed had
but vvaited of him therein, alas (thought I) good Philoxenus how evil does it
become thy name to be subscribed to his letter? what should I say? nay, what
should I not say (noble Knight) who am not ashamed, nay am delighted, thus to
express mine own passions?

Days paste; his eagernes for his friend never decreased, my affection to him
Amphialus, I fear that I shall ever enjoy: and grown bolder, or madder, or
bold with madness, I discovered my affection unto him. But, Lord, I shall
never forget, how anger and courtesy, at one instant apeared in his eyes, when
he hard that motion: how with his refusal of himself. But when he found
that his presence did far more persuade for himself, then his speech could
do for his friend, he left my court: hoping, that forgetfulness (which
commonly waits upon absence) would make room for his friend: to whom he
would not utter thus much (I think) for a kind Philoxenus came to see how
onward the fruits were of his friends labor, when (as in truth I cared not
much how he took it) he found me Amphialus, as well as Amphialus had done for
him: he never answered me, but pale and quaking, went straight away; and
straight my heart misgaue me some evil success: and yet though I had
authority enough to have stayed him (as in these fatal things it falls out,
that the hie-working powers make second causes unwittingly accessarie to their
determinations)

For he had travailed scarsea days journey out of my Country, but that (not
far from this place) he ouer-tooke Amphialus, who (by succouring a distressed
Lady) had been here stayed: and by and by called him to fight with him,
protesting Amphialus, whose heart could accuse it self of no fault, but too
much affection toward him, which he (refusing to fight with him) would feign
have made Philoxenus understand, but (as my servant since told me) the more
Amphialus went back, the Philoxenus (said Amphialus) I know I am no Traitor,
and thou well know I am no coward: but I pray thee content thy self with
this much, and let this satisfy thee, that I love thee, since I bear thus
much of thee, but he leaving words drew his sword and gave Amphialus a great
blow or Amphialus contain himself, stepping aside, and saying to him, Well
Philoxenus, and thus much villainy am I content to put up, not any longer for
thy sake (whom I have no cause to love, since thou do injury me, and wilt
not tell me the cause) but for thy virtuous fathers sake, to whom I am so much
bound. Amphialus, that in the end (nature prevailing above determination) he
was feign to defend him self, and with-all to offend him, that by an unlucky
blow the poor Philoxenus fell dead at his feet; having had time only to
speak Amphialus knew it was for my sake: which when Amphialus saw, he
forthwith gave such tokens of true felt sorrow; that as my servant said no
imagination could conceive greater woe. But that by and by, and unhappy
occasion made Amphialus pass himself in sorrow: for Philoxenus was but
newly dead, when there comes to the same place, the aged and virtuous
Timotheus, who (having heard of his sons sudden and passionate manner of
parting from my Court) had followed him as speedily as he could; but alas not
so speedily, but that he found him dead before he could overtake him.
Though my heart be nothing Amphialus and Timotheus as I have done. Alas what
sorrow, what amasement, what shame was in Amphialus, when he saw his dear
foster father, find him the killer of his only son? In my heart I know,
he wished mountains had lain upon him, to keep him from that meeting. As
Timotheus, sorrow of his son and (I think principally) unkindness of
Amphialus so devoured his vital spirits that able to say no more but
Amphialus, Amphialus, have I? he sancke to the earth, and presently died.

But not my tongue though daily used to complaints; no nor if my heart (which
is nothing but sorrow) were turned to tongues, durst it undertake to show the
vnspeakeablenes Amphialus drawing his sword, which was the only part of his
arms (God knows to what purpose) he carried about him, threatened to kill him
if he followed him, and withal, bad him deliver this bitter message, that he
well enough found, I was the cause of all this mischief: and that if I were a
man, he would go over the world to kill me: but Palladius willingly
condiscended: but ere they began to go, there came Clitophon, who having been
something hurt by one Helen, and that the cause of this enterprise was for
nothing, but to make Amphialus prisoner, who^ they knew their mistress sought;
for she concealed her sorrow, nor cause of her sorrow from no body.

But Clitophon (very sorry for this accident) came back to comfort the Queen,
helping Palladius, he drew his sword, and making no other prologue, let fly at
him. But Palladius (sorry for so much harm as had already happened) Clitophon
seeing, stepped between them, asking the new come knight the cause of his
quarrel; who answered him, that he would kill that thief, who had stolen
away his masters armor, if he did not restore it. With that Palladius looked
upon him, and saw that he of the other side had Palladius own armor upon
him: truly (said Palladius) if I have Clitophon straight knew by his words
and voice, that it was Ismenus, the faithful and diligent Page of Amphialus:
and therefore telling him that he was Clitophon, and willing him to acknowledge
his error to the other, who Palladius hands; desiring him to pardon his folly,
caused by extreme grief, which easily might bring forth anger. Sweet
Gentleman (said Palladius) you shall only make me this amends, that you
shall carry this your Lords armor from me to him, and tell him from an unknown
knight (who admires Ismenus promised he would as soon as he durst find his
master: and with that went to do his duty to the Queen, whom in all these
encounters astonishment made hardy; but as soon as she saw Ismenus (looking to
her picture) Ismenus (said she) here is my Lord, where is yours? Ismenus, I
have lost my Lord, (with that tears came unto his eyes) for as soon as the
unhappy combat was concluded with the death both of father and son, my
master casting of his armor, went his way: forbidding me upon pain of death
to follow him. Yet diverse days I followed his steps; till lastly I found
him, having newly Philoxenns. The dog straight fawned on my master for old
knowledge: but never was there thing more pitiful then to hear my master
blame the dog for loving his masters murderer, renewing a fresh his
complaints, with the dumb counceller, as if they might Ismenus (said the
Queen) a fitter messenger could hardly be to unfold my Tragedy: I see the
end, I see my end.

Palladius left her to be waited on by Clitophon, at Palladius earnest
entreatie, who desired alone to take that melancholy course of seeking his
friend: and therefore changing armours again with Ismenus (who went withal to
a castle belonging to his master) he continued his quest for his friend
Daiphantus.

Laconia, as well among the Helots, as Spartans. There indeed he found his
fame flourishing, his monuments engraued in Marble, and yet more durably in
men's memories; but the universal lamenting his absented presence, assured him
of his present absence. Thence into the Elean province, to see whether at the
Olympian games (there celebrated) he might in such concourse bless his eyes
with so desired an encounter: but that huge and sportfull assembly grew to
him a tedious loveliness, esteeming no body found, since Daiphantus was
lost. Afterward he passed through Achaia and Sicyonia, to the Corinthians,
Isthmus, it were possible to know of his passage. But finding every place more
dombe then other to his demaundes, and remembering that it was late-taken love,
which had wrought this new course, he returned again (after two months
travail in vain) to make a fresh search in Arcadia; so much the more, as
then first Philoclea (which resembling her he had once loved) might perhaps
awake again that sleeping passion^ and having already past over the greatest
part of Arcadia, one day coming under the side of the pleasant mountain
Maenalus, his horse (nothing guilty of his inquisitiuenes) with flat-tyring
taught him, that discrete stays make speedy iourneis. And therefore

Well might he perceive the hanging of her hair in fairest quantity, in
locks, some curled, and some as it were forgotten, with such a careless care,
and an art so hiding art, that she seemed she would lay them for a pattern,
whether nature Hercules made in little form, but set with a distaffe in his
hand as he Omphales commandment with a word in Greek, but thus to be
interpreted, Never more valiant. On the same side, on her thigh she ware a
sword, which as it witnessed her to be an Amazon, or one following that
profession, so it seemed but a needless weapon, since her other forces were
without withstanding. But this Lady walked outright, till he might see her
enter into a fine close she opened; which moved him as warely as he could to
follow her, and by and by he might hear her sing this song, with a voice no
less beautiful to his ears, then her goodlinesse was full of harmony to his
eyes.


I cease to strive with double conquest foild:
For (woe is me) my powers all I find
With outward force, and inward treason spoild.

Whereto mine inward thoughts did ^aintly yield;
Both these conspired poor Reasons overthrow;
False in my self, thus have I lost the field,

Thus all my thoughts are slaves to one thought still:
Thus Reason to his servants yields his right;
Thus is my power transformed to your will,
What marvel then I take a woman's hew,

The dittie gave him some suspicion, but the voice gave him almost assurance,
who the singer was. And therefore boldly thrusting open the door, and entering
into the arbor, he perceived in deed that it was Pyrocles thus disguised,
wherewith Apollo is painted when he saw Daphne suddenly turned into a
Laurel) he was not able to bring forth a word. So that Pyrocles (who had as
much shame, as Musidorus had sorrow) rising to him, would have formed a
substantial excuse; but his insinuation being of blushing, and his division of
Musidorus had gathered his spirits together, and yet casting a gastfull
countenance upon him (as if he would conjure some strange spirits) he thus
spoke unto him.

And is it possible, that this is Pyrocles, the only young Prince in the world,
formed Amazon that has counterfeited the face of my friend, in this sort to
vex me? for likelier sure I would have thought it, that any outward face might
have been disguised, then that the face of so excellent a mind could have been
thus blemished. O sweet Pyrocles, separate your self a little (if it be
possible) from your an ill player, should mar the last act of his Tragedy.
Remember (for I know you know it) that if we will be men, the reasonable part
of our soul, is to have absolute commandment; against which if any sensual
weakness arise, we are to yield all our sound forces to the overthrowing of
so unnatural a rebellion, wherein how can we want courage, since we are to
deal against so weak Kalander and of friendship with me) it utterly subuerts
the course of nature, in making reason give place to sense, and man to woman.
And truly I think heere-vpon it first gatte the name of Love: for indeed the
true love has that excellent nature in it, that it does transform the very
essence of the lover into the Amazon; for having conquered it, then to give you
further counsel, how to do it. But in Pyrocles this speech wrought no more,
but that he, who before he was espied, was afraid; after, being perceived,
was ashamed, now being hardly rubd upon, left both fear and shame, and was
moved to anger. But the exceeding Musidorus striving with it, he thus, partly
to satisfy him, but principally to loofe the reins to his own motions, made
him answer. Cousin, whatsoever good disposition nature has bestowed upon me,
or howsoever that disposition has been by bringing up confirmed, this must I
confess, that I am not yet come to that degree of wisdom, to think light of
the sex, of whom I have my Amazons, (which I know for my greatest honor do
seek to counterfeit) does well witness, that if generally the sweetness of their
disposition did not make them see the vainness of these things, which we
account Kalander, if you could feel what an inward guest my self am host
unto: ye would think it very excuseable, in that I rather perform the duties
of an host, then the ceremonies of a guest. And for my breaking the laws of
friendship with you, (which I would rather dye, then effectually Pyrocles
stayed, as to breath himself, having been transported with a little vehemence,
because it seemed him Musidorus had ouer-bitterly glaunsed against the
reputation of woman-kinde: but then quieting his countenance (as well as out of
an unquiet Musidorus, then love: But I am good witness of mine own
imperfections, and therefore will not defend myself: but herein I must say,
you deal contrary to your self: for if I be so weak, then can you not with
reason stir me up as ye did, by remembrance of my own virtue: or if indeed I
be virtuous, then must ye confess, that love has his working in a virtuous
heart: and so no dout has it, whatsoever I be: for if we love virtue, in whom
shall we love it but in a virtuous creature? without your meaning be, I
virtue, where I see it written in a book. Those troblesome effects you say it
breeds, be not the faults of love, but of him that loves; as an unable vessel
to bear such a licour: like evil eyes, not able to look on the Sun; or like
a weak brain, soonest overthrown with the best wine. Even that heavenly love
you speak of, is accompanied in some hearts with hopes, griefs, longinges, and
dispaires. Musidorus) how sharp-witted you are to hurt your self? No (answered
he) but it is the hurt you speak of, which makes me so sharp-witted. Even so
(said Musidorus) as every base occupation makes one sharp in that practice,
and foolish in all the Pyrocles) as each excellent thing once well learned,
serves for a measure of all other knowledges. And is that become (said
Musidorus) a measure for other things, which never received measure in it
self? It is counted without measure (answered Pyrocles,) because the workings
of it are without measure but otherwise, in nature it has measure, since it
has an end allotted unto it. The Pyrocles, with a deep sigh. O (said
Musidorus) now set ye forth the baseness of it: since if it end in enjoying,
it shows all the rest was nothing. Ye mistake me (answered Pyrocles) I spoke
of the end to which it is directed; which end ends not, no sooner then the
life. Alas, let your own brain disenchaunt you (said Musidorus.) Pyrocles.)
But the head gives you direction. And the heart gives me life; answered
Pyrocles.

But Musidorus was so grieved to see his well-beloved friend obstinat (as he
thought) to his own destruction, that it forced him with more then accustomed
vehemence to speak these words; Well, well, (said he) you lift to abuse your
self; it was a very which my wit could make me know, or my most entier
friendship to you requires of me; I do now beseech you even for the love
betwixt us (if this other love have left any in you toward me) and for the
remembrance of your old careful father (if you can remember him that forget
your self) lastly for Pyrocles own sake (who Pyrocles, though he were very
impatient of long deliberations, as this last farevvell of him he loved as his
own life, did vvound his Musidorus, how cruelly you deal with me; if you
seek the victory, take it and if ye list, the triumph; have you all the
reason of the world, and with me remain all the imperfections; yet such as I

And herewith the deep wound of his love being rubbed a fresh with this
Musidorus, that falling down by him and kissing the weping eyes of his friend,
he besought him not to make account of his speech; which Pyrocles the more
melte Musidorus, as who should say, And is it possible that Musidorus should
threaten to leave me? And this struck Musidorus mind and senses so dumb too,
that for grief being notable to say any thing, they rested with their eyes
placed one upon another, in such sort, as might well paint out the true passion
of unkindness

And thus remained they a time; till at length, Musidorus embrasing him, said
and will you thus shake of your friend? It is you that shake me of (said
Pyrocles) being for my imperfectness unworthy of your friendship. But this
(said Musidorus) shows you more imperfect, to be cruel to him, that submits
himself unto griefs: the second, that you love her with all the powers of
your mind: and the last commandment shall be, ye command me to do what service I
can, toward the attaining of your desires. Pyrocles heart was not so oppressed
with the two mighty passions of love and unkindness, but that it yielded to some
mirth at his commandment of Musidorus; that he should love: so that some
thing clearing his face from Pyrocles) and here are we in as fit a place for
it as may be; for this arbor no body offers to come into but my self; I using
it as my melancholy retiring place, and therefore that respect is born unto it;
yet if by chance any should come, say that you are a servant sent from the
Queen of the Amazons to seek me and then let me, alone for the rest. So
sat they down, and Pyrocles thus

Cousin (said he) then began the fatal overthrow of all my liberty when
walking among the pictures in Kala^ders house, you your self deliuerd unto me
what you had understood of Philoclea, who much resembling (though I must say
much surpassing) the Lady Zelmane, whom so well I loved: there were mine eyes
infected, and Kalander had made it more and more strong with his declaration.
Which the more I questioned, the more pity I conceived of her unworthy
fortune: and when with pity once my heart was made tender, according to the
aptness of the humor, it received quickly a cruel impression of that
wonderful Architecture of the lodges would have been much for my learning;
but more desirous to see her self, to be judge, for sooth, of the painters
cunning. For thus at the first did I flatter my self, as though my wound had
been no deeper: but when within short time I came to the degree of uncertain
Philoclea: when each thing I saw, seemed to figure out some part of my
passions; when even Parthenias fair face became a lecture to me of Philocleas
imagined beauty; when I heard no word spoken, but that me thought it carried
the sound of Philocleas name: then indeed, then I did yield to the burden,
finding my self prisoner, before Musidorus) even ran away from thy well known
chiding: for having written a letter, Ithonia in the province of Messenia; where
lying secret I put this in practice which before I had devised. For remembering
by Philanax his letter, and Kala^ders speech, how obstinately Basilius Amazon.
Zelmane, for that dear Ladies sake, to whose memory I am so much bound, I
caused this apparel to be made, and bringing it near the lodges, which are
heard at hand, by night, thus dressed my self, resting till occasion might
make me to be found by them, whom I sought: which the next morning happened as
well, as my own plot could have laid it. For

But I had song very little, when (as I think displeased with my bad music)
Dametas with a hedging bill in his hand, chasing, and swearing by the pantable
of Pallas, and such other oaths as his rusticall bravery could imagine; and
when he saw me, I assure you my beauty was no more beholding to him then my
harmony; for leaning his hands upon his bil, and his chin upon his hands, with
the voice of one that plaieth Hercules in a play, but never had his fancy in
his head, the first word he spoke to me, was, am not I Dametas? why? am not I
Dametas? he needed not name himself: for Kalanders description had set such a
note upon him, as made him very notable upon me, and therefore the height of my
thoughts would not descend Dametas pleasure. I could not choose, but smile at
him, seeing him look so like an Ape that had newly taken a purgation; yet
taking my self with the manner, spoke these words to my self: O spirit
(said I) of mine, how can thou receive any mirth in the midst of thine
agonies, and thou mirth how dare thou enter into a Dametas) do thou
think me a spirit, I tell thee I am Basilius officer, and have charge of him,
and his daughters. O only pearl (said I sobbing) that so vile an oyster
should keep thee? By the combe-case of Diana swear Dametas) this woman is mad:
oysters, and pearls? do thou think I will buie oysters? I tell
Zelmanes-ship, and drawing out my sword, the baseness of the villain yet
made me stay my hand, and he (who, as Kalander told me, from his childehood
ever feared the blade of a sword) ran back, backward (with his hands above
Latonas prayers were turned into Frogs. At length staying, findinge himself
without the compass of blows, he fell to a fresh scolding, in such mannerly
manner, as might well show he had passed through the discipline of a Tavern.
But seeing me walk up and down, without Basilius: for within a while he came
unto me, bearing in deed shows in his countenance of an honest and
well-minded gentleman, and with as much courtesy as Dametas with rudeness
saluting me, Fair Lady (said he) it is nothing strange, that such a
solitary place as this should receive solitary persons; but much do I marvel
how such a Basilius) cannot in this your lonelines neither warrant you from
suspicion in others, nor defend you from melancholy in your Basilius.) Those
that be good (said I,) and they will be satisfied as long as they see no
evil. Yet will the best in this country, (said Basilius) suspect so excellent
beauty being so weakly whose manners I am in all places to maintain and
reverence) the general goodness (which is nourished in our hearts) makes every
one think the strength of virtue in an other, whereof they find the assured
foundation in themselves. Excellent Lady (said he) you praise so greatly, (and
yet so wisely) your country, that Basilius) shall I deserve to know your
estate? By letting me first know yours (answered I.) To obey you (said he) I
will do it, although it were so much more reason, yours should be known
first, as you do deserve in all points to be Basilius, unworthily Lord of this
country: the rest, either fame has already brought to your ears, or (if it
please you to make this place happy by your presence) at more leisure you
shall understand of me. I that from the beginning assured my self it was he,
but would not seem I did so, to keep my gravity the better, making a piece
of reverence unto him, Mighty Amazons; My self niece to Senicia, Queen
thereof, lineally descended of the famous Penthesilea, slain by the bloody
hand of Pyrrhus: I having in this my youth determined to make the world see
the Amazons Basilius (who now began to taste of that, which since he has
swallowed up, as I will tell you) fell to more cunning entreating Dametas to
bring forth with his wife and daughters thither;

His wife in grave Matronlike attire, with countenance and gesture suitable,
and of such fairenes (being in the strength of her age) as if her daughters had
not been by, might with just price have purchased admiration; but they being
there, it was enough that the most dainty eye would think her a worthy mother
of Pamela, whose noble heart I find does greatly disdain, that the trust of
her virtue is reposed in such a louts hands as Dametas, had yet to show an
obedience, taken on shepeardish apparel, which was but of Russet cloth cut
after their fashion, with a straight body, open brested, the nether part full
of pleights, with long and wide sleeves: but believe me she did apparel her
Tempe) there honge a very rich Diamond set but in a black horn, the word I
have since read is this; yet still And thus particularly have I described
them, because you may know that mine eyes are not so partial, but that I
marked them too. But when the ornament of the Earth, the model of heaven, the
Triumph of Nature, the life of beauty the Queen of Love, young Philoclea
appeared in her Nimphe-like apparel, so near nakedness, as one might well
discern part of her per^^ctions; and yet so apparelled, as did show she kept
best store of her beauty to her self: her hair (alas too poor a word, why
should I not rather call the^ her beams) drawn up into a net, able to have
caught Jupiter when he was in the form of an Egle; her body (O sweet Gynecia
stepping between my sight and the only Philoclea, the change of obi^ct made
meere-couer my senses: so that I could with reasonable good manner receive the
salutation Pamela, doing them yet no further reverence then one Princess uses
to another. But when I came to the neuer-inough praised Philoclea, I could not
but fall down on my knees, and taking by force her hand, and kissing it (I
must confess) with more then womanly ardency, Divine Lady, (said I) let not
the world, nor these great princesses marvel, to se me (contrary to

But then (as I think) Basilius willing her so to do, Well (said she) I must
needs confess I have heard that it is a great happiness to be praised of them
that are most praise worthy; And well I find that you are an inuincibl^
Amazon, since you will overcome, though in a wrong matter. But if my beauty be
any thing, then let good large circuit, which according to the nature of the
country, being diuersified between hills and dales, woods and playnes, one
place more clear, an other more darksome, it seems a pleasant picture of
nature, with lovely lightsomnes and artificial shadows. The Lodge is of a
yellow stone, built in the form of a star; having Pamela lives: so that the
Lodge seems not unlike a fair Comete, whose tail stretches it self to a
star of less greatness.

Gynecia her self bringing me to my Lodging, anon after I was invited and
brought down to sup with them in the gardein, a place not fairer in natural
ornaments, then artificial inventions: where, in a banqueting house among
certain pleasant trees, whose heads seemed curled with the wrappings about of
Vine-branches The table was set near to an excellent water-worke; for by the
casting of Iris. There were birds also made so finely, that they did not only
deceive the sight with their figure, but the hearing with their songs; which
the watrie instruments did make their gorge deliver. The table at which we
Basilius at first did to make me sport) the table, and we about the table, did
all turn round, by means of water which ran under, and carried it about as
a Mill. But alas, what pleasure did it to me, to make diverse times the full
circle round about, since Philoclea (being also set) was carried still in
equal distance from me, and that only my eyes did overtake her? which when
the table was stayed, and we began to feed, drank much more eagerly of her
beauty, then my mouth did of any other licour. And so was my common sense
deceived (being chiefly bent to her) that as I drank the wine, and withal
stale a look on her, me seemed

Now thus I had (as me thought) well played my first act, assuring my self,
that under that disguisment, I should find opportunity to reveal my self to
the owner of my heart. But who would think it possible (though I feel it
true) that in almost eight weeks space, I have lived here (having no more
company but her parents,

At the first sight that Basilius had of me (I think Cupid having headed his
arrows with my misfortune) he was stricken (taking me to be such as I profess)
with great affection toward me, which since is grown to such a doting love,
that (till I was feign to get this place, sometimes to retire unto freely) I
was even choked with his tediousnes. You never saw fourscore years dance up
and down more lively Arcadia. Do you not think that this is a sallet of
woormwood, while mine eyes feed upon the Ambrosia of Philocleas beauty. But
this is not all; no this is not the worst; for he (good man) were easy enough
to be dealt with: but (as I think) Love and mischief having Gynecia also on
such a fire toward me, as will never (I fear) be quenched but with my
destruction. For she (being a woman of excellent wit, and of strong working
thoughts) whether she suspected me by my ouer-vehement showers of affection to
Philoclea (which love forced me unwisely to utter, while hope of my mask
foolishly Cupids kingdom, to see my eyes (languishing with ouer-vehement
longing) direct themselves to Philoclea: and Basilius as busy about me as a
Be, and indeed as cumbersome; making such vehement suits to me, who neither
could if I would; nor would if I could, help him: while the terrible wit of
Gynecia, carried with the beer of violent love, runs through us all. And so
ielious is she Philoclea, but that her vnwished presence gave my tale a
conclusion, before it had a beginning. And surely if I be not deceived, I see
such shows of liking, and (if I be acquainted with passions) of almost a
passionate liking in the heavenly Philoclea, toward me, that I may hope her
ears would not abhor my discourse. Basilius, he thought it best to have
lodged us together, but that the eternal hatefulnes of my destiny, made
Gynecias jealousy stop that, and all other my blessings. Yet must I confess,
that one way her love does me pleasure: for since it was my foolish fortune, or
unfortunate folly, to be known by her, that keeps her from bewraying me to
Basilius. And thus (my Musidorus) you have my Tragedy

Musidorus recommended to his best discourse, all which Pyrocles had told him.
But therein he found such intricatenesse, that he could see no way to lead him
out of the maze; yet perceauing his affection so grounded, that striving
against it, did rather anger Pyrocles) the^ that you remayn secretly in this
country, and sometimes come to this place; either late in the night, or early
in the morning, where you shall have my key to enter, because as my fortune,
either amends or empaires. I may declare it unto you, and have your counsel
and furtheraunce: and hereby I will of purpose lead her, that is the praise,
and yet the stain of all womankinde, that you may have so Musidorus bethinking
him self that his horse might Pyrocles very well liked of. Now farewell dear
cousin (said he) from me, no more Pyrocles, nor Daiphantus now, but Zelmane:
Zelmane is my name, Zelmane is my title, Zelmane is the only hope of my
advancement. Zelmane dismissed Musidorus, who departed as full of care to
help his friend, as before he was to dissuade him.

Zelmane returned to the Lodge, where (inflamed by Philoclea, watched by
Gynecia, and tired by Basilius) she was like a horse, desirous to run, and
miserably spurred, Zelmane sought occasion to speak with Philoclea; Basilius
with Zelmane; and Gynecia hindered them all. If Philoclea happened to sigh (and
sigh she did often) as if that sigh were to be waited on, Zelmane sighed also;
whereto Basilius and Gynecia soon made up four parts of sorrow. Their
affection increased their conversation; and their conversation increased their
affection. Zelmanes eyes were (like children before sweet meat) eager, but
fearful of their ill-pleasing governors. Time in one instant, seeming both
short, and long unto them: short, in the pleasingnes of such presence: long, in
the stay of their desires.

Zelmane failed not to entice them all many times abroad, because she was
desirous her friend Musidorus (near whom of purpose she led them) might have
full sight of them. Sometimes angling to a little River near hand, which for
the moisture it bestowed upon roots of some flourishing Trees, was rewarded
with their shadow. There would they sit down, and pretty wagers be made
between Pamela and Philoclea, which could soonest beguile silly fishes; while
Zelmane protested, that the fit pray for them was hearts of Princes. She also
had an angle in her hand; but the taker was so taken, that she had forgotten
taking. Basilius in the mean time would be the cook himself of what was so
caught, and Gynecia sit still, but with no still pensifnesse. Now she brought
them to see a seeled Dove, who the

Basilius returned from having forced his thoughts to please themselves in such
small conquests, there came a shepherd, who brought him word that a Gentleman
desired leave to do a message from his Lord unto him. Basilius granted;
whereupon the Gentleman came, and after the dutiful ceremonies observed, in
his masters name told him, that he was sent from Phalantus of Corinth, to
crave license, that as he had done in many other courts, so he might in his
presence defy all Arcadian Knights in the behalf of his mistres beauty, who
would besides, her Artesia (so was the mistress of Phalantus named) who in
six courses should have better of the other, in the judgment of Basilius,
with him both the honors and the pictures should remain. Basilius (though
Zelmane, (that she might not think the time so gainefull to him, loss to her)
granted him to pitch his tent for three days, not far from the lodge, and
to proclayme his challenge, that what Arcadian Knight (for none else but upon his
Phalantus, should have the like freedom of access and return.

This obtained and published, Zelmane being desirous to learn what this
Phalantus was, having never known him further then by report of his good
iusting, in so much as he was commonly called, The fair man of arms, Basilius
told her Helen Queen of Corinth, and deerly esteemed of her for his exceeding
good parts, being honorably courteous, and wronglesly valiant, considerately
pleasant in conversation, and an excellent courtier without unfaithfulness; who
(finding his sisters vnperswadeable Amphialus) had for a time left her court,
and gone into Laconia: where in the war against the Helots, he had gotten the
reputation of one, that both durst and knew. But as it was rather choice then
nature, that led him to matters of arms, so as soon as the spur of honor
ceased, he willingly rested in peaceable delights, being beloved in all
companies for his lovely Laconia, none was more agreeable then Phalantus: and he
not given greatly to struggle with his own disposition, followed the gentle
current of it, having a fortune sufficient to content, and he content with a
sufficient fortune. But in that court he saw, and was acquainted with this
Artesia, whose beauty he Basilius) many times it falls out, that these young
companions make themselves believe they love at the first liking of a likely
beauty; loving, because they will love for want of other business, not
because they feel indeed that divine power, which makes the heart find a
reason in passion: and so Artesia, who was as fit to pay him in his own money
as might be. For she thinking she did wrong to her beauty if she were not
proud of it, called her disdain of him chastity, and placed her honor in
little setting by his honoring conceit not only nature had bent her, but the
bringing up she received at my sister in law Cecropia, had confirmed her: who
having in her widowhood taken this young Artesia into her charge; because her
Father had been a dear friend of her dead husbands, had taught her to think
that there is no wisdom but Amphialus. But I think that desire has lost
Helen is, does offer so great a price as a Kingdom, to buie his favor; for if
I be not deceived in my good sister Cecr^pia, she thinks no face so beautiful,
as that which looks under a Crown. But Artesia indeed liked well of my
Nephew Amphialus; for I can never deem that love, which in hauty hearts
proceeds of a desire only to please, and as it Ismenus) to be his squire, and
her self is content to wait upon my sister, till she may see the uttermost
what she may work in Amphialus: who being of a melancholy (though I must say
truly courteous and Artesia the easier condiscended to go to the court of
Laconia, whether she was sent for by the Kings wife, to whom she is somewhat
allied.

And there after the war of the Helots, this Knight Phalantus, (at least for
tongue-delight) made him self her servant, and she so little caring, as not
to show mislike Mercury would Venus with more magnificent Eloquence: but else
neither in behavior, nor action, accusing in himself any great trouble in
mind, whether he sped or no. And she of the other side, well finding how
little it was, and not caring for more, yet taught him, that often it falls
out but a foolish wittiness, to speak more then one thinks.

Amphialus, (persuading her self perhaps, that it might fall Phalantus
unconscionable praysinges of her, and certain cast-awaie vows, how much he
would do for her sake, to arrest his word as soon as it was out of his mouth,
and by the virtue thereof to charge him to Greece, and with the challenge now
made, to give her beauty the principality over all other. Phalantus was
entrapped, and saw round about him, but could not get out. Exceedingly
perplexed he was (as he confessed to him that told me the tale) not for doubt
he had of him self (for indeed he had little cause, being accounted, with
his Lance especially (whereupon the challenge is to be tried) as perfect as
any that Greece knows; but because he feared to offend his sister Helen, and
withal (as he said) he could not so much believe his love, but that he must
think in his heart (whatsoever his mouth affirmed) Parthenia (wife to a most
noble Gentleman, my wives near kinsman) might far better put in their claim
for that prerogative. But his promise had bound him prentice, and therefore it
was now better with willingness to purchase thanks, then with a discontented
doing to have the pain, and not the reward: and therefore went on, as his
faith, rather then love, did lead Laconia, Elis, Argos and Corinth: and (as
many times it happens) that a good pleader maks a bad cause to prevail; so
has his Lawnce brought captives to the triumph of Artesias beauty, such, as
though Artesia be among the fairest, yet in that company were to have the
prehemine^ce: for in those courts many knights (that had been in other far
countries) defended such as they had Artesias excellency. And now lastly is he
come hither where he has leave to try his fortune. But I assure you, if I
thought it not in dew and true consideration an injurious service and churlish
courtesy, to put the danger of so noble a title in the deciding of such a
dangerles Phalantus know, that your eyes can sharpen a blunt Lance, and that
age, which my gray hairs (only gotten by the loving care of others) make
seem more then it is, has not diminished in me the power to protect an
undeniable verity. With that he bustled up himself, as though his heart would
feign have walked abroad. Zelmane with an inward smiling gave him outward
Phalantus, who the next morning having already caused his tents to be pitched,
near to a fair tree hard by the Lodge, had upon the tree made a shield to be
hanged up, which the defendant should strike, that would call him to the
mainteyning his challendge. The Impresa in the shield; was a heaven full of
stars, with a speech signifiyng, that it was the beauty which gave it the
praise.

Himself came in next after a triumphant chariot, made of Carnation velvet
enriched with purle and pearl, wherein Artesia sat, drawn by four winged
horses with artificial flaming mouths, and fiery wings, as if she had newly
borrowed them Phoebus. Before her marched, two after two, certain footmen
pleasantly attired, who between them held one picture after another of them,
that by Phalantus well running had lost the prize in the race of beauty, and at
every pace they stayed, turning the pictures to each side, so leasurely, that
with perfect judgment they might be discerned. The first that came in
(following the order of the time wherein they Andromana, Queen of Iberia; whom
a Laconian Knight having sometime (and with special favor) served, (though
some years since returned home) with more gratefulnes then good fortune
defended. But therein Fortune had borrowed wit; for indeed she was not
comparable to Artesia; not because she was a good deal elder (for time had not
yet been able to impouerish

Next after her was borne the counterfaite of the princess of Elis, a Lady
that taught the beholders no other point of beauty, but this, that as lyking
is, not always the child of beauty, so whatsoever likes; is beautyfull; for
in that visage there was neither Majesty, grace, favor, nor fairness; yet
she wanted not a servant Artesia. But he wrote her praises with his helmet in
the dust, and left her picture to be as true a witness of his overthrow, as his
running was of her beauty.

After her was the goodly Artaxia, great Q. of Armenia, a Lady upon whom nature
bestowed, and well placed her most delightful colors; and withal, had
proportioned Cupid delights in, the reason whereof might seem a mannish
countenance, which overthrew that lovely sweetenes, the noblest power of
womankinde, far fitter to prevail by parley, then by battle.

Of a far contrary consideration was the representation of her that next
followed, Erona Queen of Licia, who though of so brown a hair, as no man
should have iniuried it to have called it black, and that in the mixture of
her cheeks the white did so much overcome the red (though what was, was very
pure) that it came near to palenes, and that her face was a thought longer
then the exact Symmetrians perhaps would allow; yet love played his part so
well, in every part,

After her came two Ladies, of noble, but not of royal birth: the former was
named Baccha, who though very fair, and of a fatnes rather to allure, then to
mislike,

The other (whose name was written Leucippe) was of a fine daintines of beauty,

Laconia, one that seemed borne in the confines of beauties kingdom: for all
her lineaments were neither perfect possessioners thereof, nor absolute
strangers thereto^ but she was a Queen, and therefore beautiful.

But she that followed, conquered indeed with being conquered; and might well
have made all the beholders wait upon her triumph, while her self were led
captive. Helen, whose Iacinth hair courled by nature, but intercurled by art
(like a fine brook through golden sa^des) had a rope of fair pearl which now
hiding, now hidden by the hair, did as it were play at fast and loose, each
with other, mutually giving and receiving richnes. In her face so much beauty
and favor expressed, as if Helen had not been known, some would rather have
judged to the rest of the body the face was somewhat too little: but that
little was such a spark of beauty, as was able to inflame a world of love. for
every thing was full of a choice finenes, that if it wanted any thing in
majesty, it supplied it, with increase, in pleasure; and if at the first it
struck not admiration, it ravished with delight. And no indifferent soul there
was, which if it could resist from subiecting it self to make it his
Parthenia, who Artesias triumph, though far better she might have sit in
the throne. For in her every thing was goodly, and stately; yet so, that it
might seem that great-mindednes was but the auncient-bearer to the humblenes.
For her great graie eye, which might seem full of her own beauty:, a large,
and exceedingly fair forhead, with all the rest of her face and body, cast in
the mould of Noblenes; was Basilius could not abstain from praising
Parthenia, as the perfect picture of a womanly virtue, and wiuely faithfulness:
telling withal Zelmane, how he had understood, that when in the court of
Laconia, her picture (maintained by a certain Sycionian Knight) was lost,
through want, rather of valor, then justice: her husband (the famous Argalus)
would in a chafe have gone and redeemed it with a new trial. But she (more
sporting then sorrowing for her undeserved champion) told her husband, she
desired to be beautiful in no Argalus put on armor. Then would Basilius
have told Zelmane that which she already knew, of the rare trial of that
coupled affection: but the next picture made their mouths give place to their
eyes.

It was of a young maid, which sat pulling out a thorn out of a Lambs foot,
Urania, whom a rich knight called Lacemon, far in love with her, had
vnluckely defended.

The last of all in place, because last in the time of her being captive, was
Zelmane, daughter to the King Plexirtus: who at the first sight seemed to have
some resembling of Philoclea, but with more marking (comparing it to the
present Philoclea, Zelmane sighing, turning to Basilius, Alas sir (said she)
here be some pictures which might better become the tombs of their Mistresses,
the^ the triumph of Artesia. It is true sweetest Lady (said Basilius) some of
them be Knights that defended their beauty, knew not so much: without we will
say (as in some hearts I know it would fall out) that death it self could not
blot out the image which love has engraven in them. But diverse besides these
(said Basilius) has Phalantus won, but he leaves the rest, carrying only
such, who either for greatness of Artesias triumph.

Thus talked Basilius with Zelmane, glad to make any matter subject to speak
of, with his mistress, while Phalantus in this pompous manner, brought Artesia
with her gentlewomen, into one Tent, by which he had another: where they both
waited who would first strike upon the shield, while Basilius the Judge
appointed sticklers Phalantus was all in white, having in his bases, and
caparison imbroidered a wauing water: at each side whereof he had nettings
cast over, in which were diverse

But the other knight by name Nestor, by birth an Arcadian, and in affection
vowed to the fair Shepherdess, was all in black, with fire burning both upon
his armor and horse. His impresa in his shield, was a fire made of Juniper,
with this word, More But this hot knight was cooled with a fall, which at the
third course he received of Phalantus, leaving his picture to keep company
with the other of the same stamp; he going away remedilesly chafing at his
rebuke. The next was Polycetes, greatly esteemed in Arcadia, for deeds he had
done in arms: and much spoken of for the honorable love he had long borne to
Gynecia; Basilius himself was content, not only to suffer, but to be
delighted with; he carried it in so honorable and open plainnes, setting to his
love no other mark, then to do her faithful service. But neither her fair
picture, nor his fair running, could warrant him from overthrow, and her from
becoming as then the last of Artesias victories: a thing Gynecias virtues
would little have recked at another Zelmane had not seen it. But her champion
went away as much discomforted, as discomfited. Then Telamon for Polexena and
Eurileon for Elpine, and Leon for Zoana; all brave Knights, all fair Ladies,
with their going down, lifted up the balance of his praise for actiuitie, and
hers for fairenes.

Upon whose loss as the beholders were talking, there comes into the place I
see here the picture of Urania, which (I cannot tell how, nor why) these men
when they fall down, they say is not so fair as yonder gay woman. But pray
God, I may never see my old mother alive, if I think she be any more match to
Urania, then a Goat is to a fine Lamb; or then the Dog that keeps our flock
at home, is like your white Greihounde, that pulled down the Stagge last day.

And therefore I pray you let me be dressed as they be, and my heart gives me, I
shall tumble him on the earth: for indeed he might as well say, that a Couslip
is as white as a Lilly: or else I care not let him come with his great staff,
and I with this in my hand, and you shall see what I can do to him. Basilius
saw it was the fine shepherd Lalus, whom once he had before him in Pastoral
sportes, and had greatly Lalus (even weeping ripe) went among the rest, longing
to see some body that would revenge Vranias wrong; and praying heartily for
every body that ran against Phalantus, then beginning Phebilus, a Gentleman of
that country, for whom hateful fortune had borrowed the dart of Love, to make
him miserable by the sight of Philoclea. For he had even from her in fancy
loved her, and Impresa, the fish called Sepia, which being in the net castes
a black ink about it self, that in the darkness thereof it may escape: Not
so. Philocleas picture with almost an idolatrous magnificence was borne in by
him. But straight jealousy was a harbinger for disdain in Zelmanes heart, when
she saw any (but her self) should be auowed a champion for Philoclea: in
so much that she wished his shame, till she saw him shamed: for at the second
course he was stricken quite from out of the saddle, so full of grief, Basilius
would not suffer; so that wishing him self in the bottom of the earth, he
went his way, leaving Zelmane no less angry with his loss, then she would
have been with his victory. For if she thought before a riuals praise would
have angered her, her Ladies disgrace did make her much more Philocleas cheeks
bewray a modest coffeehouse. But the night commanded truce for those
sportes, and Phalantus (though entreated) would not leave Artesia, who in no
case would come into the house, having (as it were) suckte of Cecropias breath
a mortal mislike against Basilius.

But the night measured by the short ell of sleep, was soon past over, and
the next morning had given the watchful stars leave to take their rest, when a
trumpet summoned Basilius to play his judges part: which he did, taking his
wife and daughters with him; Zelmane having locked her door, so as they would
not trouble her for that time: for already there was a Knight in the field,
ready to prove Helen of Corinth had received great injury, both by the erring
judgment of the challenger, Clitophon ( Kalanders son of Basilius his
sister) by his armor, which all guilt, was so well handled, that it showed
like a glittering sand and gravel, enterlaced with silver rivers: his device
he had put in the picture of Helen which he defended. It was the Ermion with
a speech that signified, Rather But in that armor since he had parted from
Helen (who would no longer his company, finding him to enter into terms of
affection,) he had performed so honorable actions, (still seeking for his two
friends by the names of Palladius and Daiphantus,) that though his face were
covered, his being was discovered, which yet Basilius (which had brought him up
in his court) would not Basilius in the end gave sentence against Clitophon,
because Phalantus had broken more Clitophon had received such a blow, that he
had lost the raines of his horse, with his head well nie touching the croper of
the horse. But Clitophon was so angry with the judgment, (where in he thought
he had received wrong) that he omitted his duty to his Prince, and uncle; and
suddenly went his way still in the quest of them, whom as then he had left by
seeking: and so yielded the field to the next commer.



Phalantus angry of this defacing his shield, came upon the black Knight, and
with the pommell of his sword set fire to his eyes, which presently was
revenged, not only by the Black, but the ill apparelled Knight, who disdained
another should enter into his quarrel, so as, who ever saw a matachin dance
to imitate

But Basilius rising himself came to part them, the sticklers authority
scarslie able to persuade cholerike hearers; and part them he did.

But before he could determine, comes in a fourth, halting on foot, who
complained to Basilius, demanding justice on the black Knight, for having by
force taken away the picture of Pamela from him, which in little form he
ware in a Artesias length, not doubting but even in that little quantity, the
excellency of that would shine through the weakness of the other: as the
smallest star does through the whole Element of fire. And by the way he had
met with this black Knight, who had (as he said) robbed Pamelas divine
beauty against Artesias, with a proud iollitie commanded him to leave that
quarrel only for him, who was only worthy to enter into it. But the black
Knight obeying no such Basilius, he told him he was now fitter to look to his
own body, then an others picture: and so (vncomforted therein) sent him away
to learn of AEsculapius that he was not fit for Venus. But then the question
arising who should be the former against Phalantus, of the black, or the ill
apparelled Phalantus; who asking him for it, Certainly (said Phebilus so
feebly lost Phalantus easily agreed to the bargain, which already he made
his own.

But when it came to the trial, the ill apparelled Knight choosing out the
greatest staves in all the store, at the first course gave his head such a
remembrance, Phalantus without any extraordinary motion. And at the second
gave him such a counterbuffe, that because Phalantus was so perfect a horseman,
as not to be driven from the saddle, the saddle with broken girthes was driven
from the horse: Phalantus remaining angry and amazed, because now being come
almost

But the victory being by the judges given, and the trumpets witnessed to the
ill by apparelled Knight; Phalantus disgrace was ingrieued in lieu of comfort
of Artesia who telling him she never looked for other, bad him seek some other
mistress. He

Nay truly Madame (said Phalantus) it shall not be so: for I think the loss
of such a Mistress will prove a great gain: and so concluded; to the sport
of Basilius, to see young folks love, that came in maskt with so great pomp,
go out with so little constancy. But Phalantus first professing great service
to Basilius for his courteous Artesia to the castle of Cecropia, whether she
desired to go: vowing in himself, that neither heart, nor mouth-loue, should
ever any more entangle him. And with that resolution he left the company.
Whence all being dismissed (among whom the black Knight went away repining at
his luck, that had kept him from winning the honor, Pamela) the ill apparelled
Knight (who was only desired to stay, because Basilius meant to show him to
Zelmane) pulled off his Helmet, and then was known himself to be Zelmane: who
that morning (as she told) while the others were busy, had stolen out to the
Princes stable, which was a mile off from the Lodge, had gotten a horse (they
knowing it was Basilius pleasure Philocleas picture, which she said, she could
not bear, (being one of that little wildernesse-company) should be in
captivity, if the cunning she had learned in her country of the noble
Amazons, could withstand it: and under that pretext feign she would have given
a secret pasport to her Philocleas face, and palenesse in Gynecias, but brought
forth no other countenances but of admiration, no speeches but of
commendations: all these few (besides love) thinking they honored themselves,
in honoring so accomplished a person as Zelmane: whom daily they sought with
some or other sports to delight, for which purpose Basilius had in a house not
far off^ servants, who though they came not uncalled, yet at call were

And so many days were spent, and many ways used, while Zelmane was like one
that stood in a tree waiting a good occasion to shoot, and Gynecia a
blauncher, which kept the dearest dear from her. But the day being come, on
which according Basilius: Zelmane (fearing, lest many eyes, and coming diverse
ways, might hap to spy Musidorus) went out to warn him thereof.

But before she could come to the Arbor, she saw walking from her-ward, a man
in sheapperdish apparel who being in the sight of the Lodge it might seem

Come shepherds weeds, become your masters mind:
Yield outward show, what inward change he tryes:

Whose strongest hope in your weak comfort lies.
Come shepherds weeds, attend my woeful cries:
Disuse your selves from sweet Menalcas voice:
For other be those tunes which sorrow ties,
From those clear notes which freely may rejoice.
Then power out plaint, and in oneword say this:
Helples his plaint, who spoils himself of bliss.
And having ended, he struck himself on the breast; saying, O miserable wretch,
whether do thy destenies guide thee? The voice made Zelmane hasten her pace to
overtake him: which having done, she plainly perceived that it was her dear
Musidorus, whereat maruailing not a little, she demanded of him, whether the
Goddess of those woods had such a power to transform every body, or whether,
as in all enterprises else he had done, he meant thus to match her in this new
alteration. Alas, (said Musidorus) what shall I say, who am loath to say, and
yet feign would have said? I find indeed, that all is but lip-wisdome, which
wants experience. Zelmane, who will resist it, must either have no wit, or put
out his eyes? can any man resist his creation? certainly by love we are made,
and to love we are made. Beasts only cannot discern beauty, and let them be in
the role of Beasts that do not honor it. The perfect friendship Zelmane bare
him, and the great pity she (by good trial) had of such Musidorus,) and
withal falling down prostrate, O thou celestial, or infernal spirit of
Love, or what other heavenly or hellish title thou list to have (for effects of
both I find in my self) have compassion of me, and let thy glory be as great
in pardoning them that be submitted to thee, as in conquering those that were
rebellious. No, no said Zelmane, I see you well enough: you make but Musidorus
taking her ^ast by the hand) even for the truth of our friendship, of which (if
I be not altogether an unhappy man) thou have some rememberance, and by those
secret flames which (I know) have likewise Musidorus both in words and
behavior, did so lively deliver out his inward grief, that Zelmane found
indeed, he was thoroughly wounded: but there rose a new ielousy in her mind,
lest it might be with Philoclea, by Zelmane thought, in right all hearts and
eyes should be inherited. And therefore desirous to be cleared of that doubt,
Musidorus shortly (as in have and full of passionate perplexednes,) thus
recounted his case unto her.

The day (said he) I parted from you, I being in mind to return to a town,
from whence I came hither, my horse being before tired, would scarce bear me a
mile Menalcas, who seeing me to be a straying stranger, with the right honest
hospitality which seems to be harbored in the Arcadian breasts, and though
not with curious costlines, yet with cleanly sufficiency, entertained me: and
having by talk with him, found the manner of the country, something more in
particular, then I had by Kalanders report, I agreed to soiourne Zelmane was
racked with jealousy. But he went on, For (said he) I lying close, and in
truth thinking of you, Pyrocles, how art thou bewitched? where is thy virtue?
where is the use of thy reason? how much am I inferior to thee in the state of
the mind? And yet know I, that all the heavens cannot bring me to such
thraldom. Scarcely, think I, had I spoken this word, when the Ladies came
forth; at which sight, I think the very words returned back again to strike
my soul; at Zelmane, not able to bear him any longer. O (said Musidorus) I
know your suspicion; No, no, banish all such fear, it was, it is, and must be
Pamela: Then all is safe (said Zelmane) proceed, dear Musidorus. I will not
(said he) impute it to my late solitary life (which yet is prone to
affections) nor, to the much thinking of you Venus; nor revenge of Cupid; but
even to her, who is the Planet, nay, the Goddess, against which, the only
shield must be my Sepulcher. When I first saw her, I was presently stricken, and
I (like a foolish child, that when any thing hits him, will strike himself
again upon it) would needs

And that you may know I do so, it was I that came in black armor to defend
her picture, where I was both prevented, and beaten by you. And so, I that
waited here to do you service, have now my self most need of succor. But
whereupon got you your self this aparrell? said Zelmane. I had forgotten to
tell you (said Musidorus) Menalcas house, full of tormenting desire, after a
while faynting under the weight, my courage stird up my wit to seek for some
relief, before I yielded to perish. At last this came into my head, that very
evening, that I had to no purpose last used my horse and armor. Menalcas, that
I was a Thessalian Gentleman, who by mischaunce having killed a great fauorit
of the Prince of that country, was pursued so cruelly, that in no place, but
either by favor, or corruption, they would obtain my destruction; and that
therefore I was determined (till the fury of my persecutors might be assuaged)
to disguise my self among the shephards of Arcadia, and (if it were possible)
to be Menalcas (being of an honest disposition) pitied my case, which my face
through my inward torment made credible; and so (I giving him largely for it)
let me have this raiment, instructing me in all the particularities, touching
himself, or my self, which I desired to know: yet not trusting so much to his
constancy, as that I would lay my life, and life of my life, upon it, I hired
him to go into Thessalia to a friend of mine, and to Calodoulus (whom you
know) that as soon Menalcas gone, and I here a poor shepherd; more proud of
this estate, then of any kingdom: so manifest it is, that the highest point
outward things can bring one unto, is the contentment Menalcas told me) the
other shepherds are called to make their sports, and hope that you will with
your credit, find means to get me allowed among them. You need not doubt
(answered Zelmane) but that I will be your good mistress: marry the best way
of dealing must Dametas, who since his blunt brain has perceived some favor
the Prince does bear unto me (as without doubt the most servile flattery is
lodged most easily in the grossest capacity; for their ordinary conceit
draws a yielding to their greaters, and then have they not wit to discern
the right degrees of duty) is much more serviceable unto me, then I can find
any cause to wish him. And Musidorus) to what a pass are our minds brought,
that from the right line of virtue, are wryed to these crooked shifts? But o
Love, it is thou that do it: thou

No more sweet Musidorus (said Zelmane) of these philosophies; for here comes
the very person of Dametas. And so he did in deed, with a sword by his side, a
forrest-bill Zelmane had put him in. But he no sooner saw her, but with head
and arms he laid his reverence before her; enough to have made any man
forswear all courtesy. And then in Basilius name, he did inuit her to walk
down to the place, where that day they were to have the

But when he spied Musidorus to be none of the shepherds allowed in that
place, he would feign have persuaded himself to utter some anger, but that he
durst not; yet muttering, and champing, as though his cudde troubled him; he
gave occasion to Musidorus to come near him, and feine this tale of his own
Menalcas, by name Dorus, sent by his father in his tender age to Athens, there
to learn some cunning more then ordinary, that he might be the better liked
of the Prince: and that after his fathers death, his brother M^nalcas (lately
gone thither to fetch him home) was also deceased: where (upon his death) he
had charged him to seek the service of Dametas, and to be wholly, and ever
guyded by him; as one in whose judgment and integrity, Dametas a good sum
of gold in ready coin, which Menalcas had bequeathed unto him, upon condition
he should receive this poor Dorus into his service, that his mind and manners
might grow the better by his daily example. Dametas, that of all manners of
style could best conceive of golden eloquence, being withal tickled by
Musidorus Pamela. But such was the secret operation of the gold, helped with
the persuasion of the Amazon Zelmane, (who said it was pity so handsome a
young man should be any where Basilius, as he might be contented) that then he
would receive him into his service.

And thus went they to the Lodge, where they found Gynecia and her daughters
ready to go to the field, to delight themselves there a while, until the
shepherds Zelmane with them, as they went, Dametas told them of Dorus, and
desired he might be accepted there that day, in steed of his brother Menalcas.
As for Basilius, he stayed behind to bring the shepherds, with whom he meant
to confer, to breed the better Zelmanes liking (which he only regarded) while
the other beautiful band came to the fair field, appointed for the
shepherdish Theater) grew such sort of trees, as either excellency of fruit,
statelines of grouth, continual greennes, or poetical fancies have made at
any time famous. In most part of which there had been framed by art such
pleasant arbors, that (one answering another) they became a gallery aloft from
tree to tree almost round about, Phoebus.

In this place while Gynecia walked hard by them, carrying many unquiet
contentions about her, the Ladies sat them down, inquiring diverse questions
of the shepherd Dorus; who (keeping his eye still upon Pamela) answered with
such a Zelmane that saw in him the glass of her own misery, taking the hand
of Philoclea, and with burning kisses setting it close to her lips (as if it
should stand there like a hand in the margin with a she Bear not far from
him, of little less fiercenes, which (as they ghest) having been hunted in
Forests far off, were by chance come thither, where before such beasts had
never been seen. Then care, not fear; or fear, not for themselves, altered
some thing the countenances of the two Lovers, but so, as any man might
perceive, was rather an assembling of powers, then dismaiednes of courage.
Philoclea no sooner espied the Lion, but that obeying the commandment of
fear, she lept up, and ran to the lodge-ward, as fast as her delicate legs
could carry her, while Dorus drew Pamela behind a tree, where she stood
quaking like the Partridge, on which the Hawke is even ready to seize. But the
Lion (seeing Philoclea run away) bent his race to her-ward, and was ready to
seize him self on the pray, when Zelmane (to whom danger then was a cause of
dreadlesnes, all the composition of her elements being nothing but fiery) with
swiftness of desire crossed him, and with force of affection struck him such a
blow upon his chine, that she opened all his body: wherewith the valiant beast
turning upon her with open jaws, she gave him such a thrust through his breast,
that all the Lion could do, was with his paw to Zelmane, with a little scratch,
rather then a wound; his death-blow having taken away the effect of his force.
But there withal he fell down, and gave Zelmane leisure to take of his head,
to carry it for a present to her Lady Philoclea: who all this while (not
knowing what was done behind her) kept on her course, like Arethusa when she
ran from Alpheus; her light apparel being Zelmane. Which made Zelmane not
follow her over hastily, lest she should too soon deprive her self of that
pleasure: But carrying the Lions head in her hand, did not fully overtake her,
till they came to the presence of Basilius. Neither were they long Gynecia came
thither also: who had been in such a trance of musing, that Zelmane was
fighting with the Lion, before she knew of any Lions coming: but then
affection resisting, and the soon ending of the fight preventing all
extremity of fear, she marked Zelmanes fighting. And when the Lions head was
of, as Zelmane ran after Philoclea, so she could not find in her heart but run
after Zelmane: Philoclea with such fear, that she thought she was still in the
Lions mouth: Zelmane with an eager and impatient delight; Gynecia with wings of
Love, flying she neither knew, nor cared to know whether. But now, being all
come before Basilius amazed with this sight, and fear having such possession
in the fair Philoclea, that her blood durst not yet to come to her face, to
take away the name of palenesse from her most pure whitenes, Zelmane kneeled
down, and presenting the Lions head unto her. Only Lady (said she) here see
you the punishment of that unnatural beast, which contrary to his own kind
would have wronged Princes Philoclea then blushing, for fear had bequeathed
his room to his kinsman bashfulnes) that you excellent Amazon, were there to
teach him good manners. And even thanks to that beauty (answered Zelmane)
which can give an edge to the bluntest swords. There Philoclea told Zelmane,
she perceived some blood upon Zelmanes shoulder, so that starting with the
lovely grace of pity, she showed it to her Father and mother: who, as the
nurse sometimes with overmuch kissing may forget to give the babe suck, so
had they with too much delighting, in beholding and praising Zelmane, left of
to mark whether she needed succor. But then they ran both unto her, like a
father and mother to an only Zelmane assured them it was nothing) would needs
see it; Gynecia having skill in surgery, an art in those days much esteemed,
because it served to virtuous courage, which even Ladies would (ever with the
contempt of cowardes) seem to cherish. But looking upon it (which gave more
inward bleeding wounds to Zelmane, for she might sometimes feel Philocleas
touch, whiles she

But even then, and not before, they remembered Pamela, and therefore Zelmane
(thinking of her friend Dorus) was running back to be satisfied, when they
might all see Pamela coming between Dorus and Dametas, having in her hand the
paw of Dorus had newly presented unto her, de^iring her to accept it, as of
such a beast, which though she deserved death for her presumption, yet was her
wit to be esteemed, since she could make so sweet a choice. Dametas for his
part came piping and dancing, the meriest man in a parish. But when he came so
near, as he might be heard of Basilius, he would needs break through his
ears NOw thanked be the great God Pan,
which thus preserues my loved life:
Thanked be I that keep a man,

For if my man must praises have,
what then must I that keep the knave?
For as the Moon the eye does please,

Yet has sir Sun the greatest praise,
because from him does come her light:
So if my man must praises have,
what then must I that keep the knave?


Being all now come together, and all desirous to know each others adue^tures,
Pamelas noble heart would needs gratefully make known the valiant mean of her
safety which (directing her speech to her mother) she did in this manner. As
soon (said she) as ye were all run away, and that I hoped to be in safety,
there came out of the sight I had (when I thought my self already near
Charons ferry,) was the shepherd showing me his bloody knife in token of
victory. I pray you (said Zelmane, speaking to Dorus, whose valor she was
careful to have manifested) in what sort, so ill weaponed, could you atchiue
this enterprise? Noble Lady (said Dorus) the manner of these beasts fighting
with any man, is to stand up upon their hinder Pan, (ever careful of the
chief blessings of Arcadia) guided my hand so just to the heart of the beast,
that neither she could once touch me, nor (which is the only matter in this
worthy remembrance) breed any danger to the Princess. For my part, I am rather
(withal subjected humblenes) to thank her excellencies, since the Dorus
spoke, keeping affection as much as he could, back from coming into his eyes
and gestures. But Zelmane (that had the same Character in her heart) could
easily discipher it, and therefore to keep him the longer in speech, desired
to understand the conclusion of the matter; and how Dametas was escaped. Nay
(said Pamela) none shall take that office from my self, being so much bound to
him as I am, for my education. And with that word (scorn borrowing the
countenance of mirth) somewhat she smiled, and thus spoke on? When (said she)
Dorus made me assuredly perceive, that all cause of fear was passed (the truth
is) I was ashamed to find my self alone with this shepherd: Dametas, lying
with his head and breast as far as he could thrust himself into a bush,
drawing up his legs as close unto him as he could: for, like a man of a
very kind nature, soon to take pity of himself, he was full resolved not
to see his own death. And when this sheephearde Dorus was not the bear: so
that he was feign to pull him out by the heels, and show him the beast, as
dead as he could wish it: which you may believe me, was a very joyful sight
unto him. But then he forgate all courtesy, for he fell upon the beast, giving
it many a manfull wound: swearing by much, it was not Basilius) I have not
chosen Dametas for his fighting, nor for his discoursing, but for his
plainness and honesty, and therein I know he will not deceive me. But then he
told Pamela (not so much because she should know it, as because Zelmane had
performed, which Gynecia likewise spoke off, both in such extremity of
praising, as was easy to be se^ne, the construction of their speech might best
be made by the Grammar rules of affection. Basilius told with what a gallant
grace she ran with the Lions head in her hand, like another Pallas with the
spoils of Gorgon. Gynecia swear, she saw the very face of the young Hercules
killing the Nemean Lio^, and al with a grateful assent confirmed the same
praises: only poor Dorus (though of equal desert, yet not proceeding of equal
estate) should have been left forgotten, had not Zelmane again with great
admiration begun to speak of him; asking, whether it were the fa^hion or no,
in Arcadia, that shepherds should perform such valorous enterprises.

This Basilius (having the quick sense of a lover) took, as though his
Mistres had given him a secret reprehension, that he had not showed more
gratefulness to Dorus; and therefore (as nymblie as he could) enquired of his
estate, adding promise of great rewards: among the rest, offering to him, if
he would exercise his courage in souldierie, he would commit some charge unto
him under his Lieutenant Philanax. But Dorus (whose ambition clymed by another
stayre) having first Menalcas; who among other, was wont to resort to the
Princes presence, and excused his going to souldierie, by the unaptness he
found in himself that way: he told Basilius, that his brother in his last
testament had willed him to serve Dametas; and therefore (for due obedience
thereunto) he would think his service greatly rewarded, if he Basilius
(liking well his goodly shape and handsome manner) charged Dametas to receive
him like a son into his house: saying, that his valor, and Dametas truth
would be good bulwarks against such mischiefs, as (he sticked not to say)
were threatened to his daughter Pamela.

Dametas, no whit out of countenance with all that had been said (because he
had no worse to fall into then his own) accepted Dorus: and withal telling
Basilius, that some of the shepherds were come; demanded in what place he
would see their sports: who first curious to know whether it were not more
requisite for Zelmanes hurt to rest, then sit up at those pastimes; and she
(that felt no wound but one) earnestly Basilius commanded it should be at the
gate of the lodge: where the throne of the Prince being (according to the
ancient manner) he made Zelmane sit between him and his wife therein, who
thought her self between drowning and burning: and the two young Ladies of
either side the throne and so prepared their eyes and ears to be delighted by
the shepherds.

Basilius, that his Mistres, the Lady Cecropia, had sent him to excuse the
mischance of her beasts ranging in that dangerous sort, being happened by the
folly of the keeper; who thinking himself able to rule them, had carried them
abroad, and so was deceived: Basilius would punish for it) she was ready to
deliver. Basilius made no other answer, but that his Mistres if she had any
more such beasts, should cause them to be killed: and then he told his wife
and Zelmane of it, because they should not fear those woods; as though they
harbored such beasts, where the like had never been seen. But Gynecia took a
further conceit of it mistrusting greatly Cecropia, because she had heard much
of the devilish wickedness of her heart, and that particularly she did her
best to bring up her son Amphialus (being brothers son to Basilius) to
aspire to the crown, as next heir male after Basilius; and therefore saw no
reason, but that she might conjecture, it proceeded rather of some mischievous
practice, than of misfortune. Yet did she only utter her doubt to her
Basilius looked no further into it, who (good man) thought so much of his late
conceived common wealth, that all other matters were but digressions unto him.
But the shepherds were ready, and with

The first Ecloges.
BAsilius, because Zelmane so would have it, used the artificial day of
torches, to lighten the sportes their inventions could minister. And because
many of the Dametas, who much disdayned (since his late authority) all his old
companions, brought his servant Dorus in good acquaintance Pan, and his
companions Satyrs. Then would they cast away their Pipes; and holding hand in
hand dance as it were in a braule, by the only cadence of their voices, which
they would use in singing some short coplets, whereto the one half beginning,
the other half should answer. as the one half saying.

We love, and have our loves rewarded
The others would answer.
We love, and are no whit regarded,
The first again.
We find most sweet affections snare.
With like tune it should be as in a quire sent back again,
That sweet, but sower dispairefull care.
A third time likewise thus:
Who can despair, whom hope does bear?
The answer:
And who can hope that feels despair?
Then all joining their voices, and dancing a faster measure, they would
conclude with some such words:
As without breath, no pipe does moan:
No music kindlye without love.
Having thus varied both their songs and daunces into diverse sorts of
inventions; their last sport was one of them to provoke an other to a more
large expressing of his passions: which Thyrsis (accounted one of the best
singers amongst them) having marked in Dorus dancing no less good grace and
hansome behavior, then extreme Dorus, and was by him answered in the
underwritten sort.

Thyrsis and Dorus. Thyrsis. Come Dorus, come, let songs thy sorrows signify
And if for want of use thy mind ashamed is,
That very shame with loves high title dignifie.
No style is held for base, where love well named is:
Each ear suckes up the words, a true love scatters,
And plain speech often, then quaint phrase better framed is.

Dorus. Nightingales seldom sing, the Pie still chattereth
The wood cries most, before it thoroughly kindled be^
Deadly wounds inward bleed, each slight sore mattereth.
Hardly they heard, which by good hunters singled be.

Nor true love loves his loves with others mingled be.

Thyrsis. If thou will not be seen, thy face go hide away,
Be none of us, or else maintain our fashion:

But if thou have a love, in that loves passion,
I challenge thee by show of her perfection,
Which of us two deserves most compassion.

Dorus. Thy challenge great, but greater my protection:
Sing then, and see (for now thou have inflamed me)
Thy health too mean a match for my infection.
No though the heavens for high attempts have blamed me,
Yet high is my attempt. O Muse historifie
Her praise, whose praise to learn your skill has framed me.

Thyrsis. Muse hold your peace: but thou my God Pan glorify
My Kalas gifts: who with all good gifts filled.
Thy pipe, o Pan, shall help, though I sing sorilie

Who though she be no Be, yet full of honey is:
A Lilly field, with plowe of Rose which tilled is.
Mild as a Lamb, more dainty then a Conie is:
Her eyes my eyesight is, her conversation

What coye account she makes of estimation?
How nice to touch? how all her speeches peized be?
A Nymph thus turnde, but mended in translation.

Dorus. Such Kala is: but ah my fancies raised be
In one, whose name to name were high presumption,
Since virtues all, to make her title, pleased be
O happy Gods, which by inward assumption
Enjoy her soul, in bodies fair possession,

How often with rain of tears skies make confession,
Their dwellers rapt with sight of her perfection
From heau'enly throne to her heaven use digression?
Of best things then what world can yield confection
To liken her? deck yours with your comparison:
She is her self, of best things the collection.

Thyrsis. How often my doleful Sire cried to me, tarry son
When first he spied my love? how often he said to me,
Thou art no soldier fit for Cupids garrison?
My son, keep this, that my long toil has laid to me:
Love well thine own: me thinks woolles, whitenes passes all:
I never found long love such wealth has paid to me.
This wind he spent: but when my Kala glasseth all
My sight in her fair limbs I then assure my self,
Not rotten sheep, but high crowns she surpasses all.
Can I be poor, that her gold hair procure my self?
Want I white wool, whose eyes her white skin garnished?
Till I get her, shall I to keep enure my self?

Dorus. How often, when reason saw, love of her harnised
With armor of my heart he cried, O vanity
To set a pearl in steel so meanly varnished?
Look to thy self reach not beyond humanity.
Her mind, beams, state, far from thy weak wings banished:
And love which lover hurts is in humanity
Thus Reason said: but she came, Reason vanished;
Her eyes so maistering me, that such objection
Seemed but to spoil the food of thoughts long famished,
Her peereles height my mind to high erection
Draws up; and if hope failing end lives pleasure,
Of fayrer death how can I make election?

Thyrsis. Once my well waiting eyes espied my treasure,
With sleeves turnde up, loose hair, and breast enlarged,
Her fathers corn (moving her fair limbs) measure.
O cried I, of so mean work be discharged:
Measure my case, how by thy beauties filling
With seed of woes my heart brimme full is charged.
Thy father bids thee save, and chides for spilling.
Save then my soul, spill not my thoughts well heaped,
No lovely praise was ever got by killing.
These bold words she did bear, this fruit I reaped,
That she, whose look alone might make me blessed,
Did smile on me and then away she leaped.

Dorus. Once, O sweet once, I saw with dread oppressed
Her whom I dread: so that with prostrate lying
Her length the earth in Loves chief clothing dressed.
I saw that riches fall, and fell a crying;
Let not dead earth enjoy so dear a cover,
But deck therewith my soul for your sake dying.
Lay all your fear upon your fearful lover:

So I your sight, you shall your selves recover.
I cried and was with open rays rewarded:
But straight they fledd, summond by cruel honor,
Honor, the cause desert is not regarded.

Thyrsis. This maid, thus made for joys, o Pan bemone her,
That without love she spends her years of love:
So fair a field would well become an owner.
And if enchantment can a hard heart move,

Affections charms in my behalf to prove.
The circle is my (round about her) sight,
The power I will inuoke dwelles in her eyes:
My charm should be she haunt me day and night.

Dorus. Far other case, o Muse, my sorrow tries,
Bent to such one in whom my self must say,
Nothing can mend that point that in her lies.
What circle then in so rare force bears sway?

No charm holds her but well possess she may,
Possess she does, and makes my soul her slave:
My eyes the bands, my thoughts the fatal knot.
No thrall like them that inward bondage have.

Thyrsis. Kala at length conclude my lingering lotte:
Disdain me not, although I be not fair.
Who is an heir of many hundredth sheep
Does beawties keep which never sun can burn,

Yet all my health I place in your good will.
Which if you will (o do) bestow on me,
Such as you see, such still you shall me find,
Constant and kind, my sheep your food shall breed,

In flowrie field, and as the day begins
With twenty ginnes we will the small birds take,
And pastimes make, as nature things has made.
But when in shade we meet of myrtle bows,

The thought of which does pass all worldly pelf.

Dorus. Lady your self whom neither name I dare,
And titles are but spots to such a worth,
Hear plaints come forth from dungeon of my mind.
The noblest kind reiects not others woes.
I have no shows of wealth: my wealth is you,
My beauties hew your beams, my health your deeds;
My mind for weeds your virtues liuerie wears.
My food is tears; my tunes wamenting yield:
Despair my field; the flowers spirits wars:
My day new cares; my ginnes my daily sight,
In which do light small birds of thoughts orethrowne:
My pastimes none: time passes on my fall.
Nature made all but me of dolours made
I find no shade, but where my Sun does burn:
No place to turn; without, within it fries:
Nor help by life or death who living dies.

Thyrsis. But if my Kala thus my suit denies,
Which so much reason bears:
Let crows pick out mine eyes which too much saw.
If she still hate loves law,
My earthy mould, does melt in watrye tears.

Dorus. My earthy mould does melt in watrye tears,
And they again resolve,
To air of sighs, sighs to the hearts fire turn
Which does to ashes burn.
Thus does my life within it self dissolve.

Thyrsis. Thus does my life within it self dissolve
That I grow like the beast,
Which bears the bytt a weaker force does guide,
Yet patient must abide.
Such weight it has which once is full possessed.

Dorus. Such weight it has which once is full possessed
That I become a vision,
Which has in others head his only being
And lives in fancy seeing.
O wretched state of man in self division!

Thyrsis. O wretched state of man in self division
O well thou say! a feeling declaration
Thy tongue has made of Cupids deep incision.
But now hoarse voice, does fail this occupation,
And others long to tell their loves condition.
Of singing thou have got the reputation.

Dorus. Of singing thou have got the reputation
Good Thyrsis mine, I yield to thy ability;
My heart does seek an other estimation.
But ah my Muse, I would thou had facility

On me to cast those eyes where shine nobility:
Seen and unknown, heard, but without attention.

Dorus did so well in answering Thyrsis, that every one desired to hear him
Pamelas feet glad to have such an errand to approach her, he came, but came
with a dismayed grace, all his blood stirred betwixt fear and desire. And
playing upon it with such sweetenes, as every body wondered to see such skill
in a shepeheard, he sang unto it with a sorrowing voice these Elegiake verses:
Dorus. -- Fortune, Nature, Love, long have contended about me,
Which should most miseries, cast on a worm that I am.
-- Fortune thus began say; misery and misfortune is all one,
And of misfortune, fortune has only the gift.

Still do I cross this wretch, what so he takes in hand.
-- Tush, tush, said nature, this is all but a trifle, a man's self
Gives happs or mishapps, even as he ordreth his heart.
-- But so his humor I frame, in a mould of choler adusted,

-- Love smiled, and thus said; Want joined to desire is unhappy.
But if he naught do desire, what can Heraclitus aile?
-- None but I, works by desire: by desire have I kindled in his soul
Infernal agonies unto a bewtye divine,

Her virtue is sovereign, fortune a vassal of hers.
-- Nature abasht went back: fortune blushed: yet she replide thus:
And even in that love, shall I reserve him a spite.
-- Thus, thus, alas! woeful in nature, unhappy by fortune,




Dorus when he had soong this, having had all the while a free beholding of the
fair Pamela (who could well have spared such honor, and defended the assault
he gave unto her face with bringing a fair stain of shamefastnes unto it)
Pamela had graffed him there to grow in continual imagination. But Zelmane
espying it, and fearing he should too much forget himself, she came to him,
and took out of his hand the Lute, and laying fast hold of Philocleas face
with her eyes, she soong these Sapphikes speaking as it were to her own hope.

If mine eyes can speak to do hearty errande,
Or mine eyes language she do hap to judge of,
So that eyes message be of her received,
Hope we do live yet.
But if eyes fail then, when I most do need them,
Or if eyes language be not unto her known,
So that eyes message do return rejected,
H^pe we do both dye.
Yet dying, and dead, do we sing her honor;
So become our tombs monuments of her praise;
So becomes our loss the triumph of her gain;
Hers be the glory.
If the spheres senseless do yet hold a music,
If the Swannes sweet voice be not heard, but at death,
If the mute timber when it has the life lost,
Yeldeth a Lutes tune:
Are then humane minds priuiledg'd so meanly
As that hateful death can abridge them of power
With the vow of truth to record to all worlds
That we be her spoils?
Thus not ending, ends the due praise of her praise:
Fleshly veil consumes; but a soul has his life,
Which is held in love; love it is, that has joined
Life to this our soul.
But if eyes can speak to do hearty errand,
Or mine eyes language she do hap to judge of,
So that eyes message be of her received,
Hope we do live yet.
Great was the pleasure of Basilius, and greater would have been Gynaecias, but
that she found too well it was intended to her daughter, As for Philoclea she
was swetely ravished withal. When Dorus desiring in a secret manner to speak
of their Zelmane, began this provoking song in hexameter verse unto her.
Whereunto she soon finding whither his words were directed (in like tune and
verse) answered as follows: Dorus. Zelmane. Dorus. Lady reserud by the heavens
to do pastors company honor,
Joining your sweet voice to the rural muse of a deserte,
Here you fully do find this strange operation of love,
How to the woods love runs as well as rydes to the Palace,
Neither he bears reverence to a Prince nor pity to beggar,
But (like a point in midst of a circle) is still of a neernesse,
All to a lesson he draw's, nether hills nor caves can avoid him.

Zelmane. Worthy shepeheard by my song to my self all favor is happned,
That to the sacred Muse my anoyes somewhat be revealed,
Sacred Muse, who in one contaynes what nine do in all them.
But o happy be you, which safe from fyry reflection
Of Phoebus violence in shade of sweet Cyparissus,
Or pleasant mirtell, may teach th'vnfortunate Echo

Happy be you that may to the saint, your only Idea,
(Although simply atyrde) your manly affection utter.
Happy be those mishapps which justly proportion holding
Give right sound to the ears, and enter aright to the judgment,

How much more we do love, so the less our loves be believed.
What skill salueth a soar of a wrong infirmity judged?
What can justice avail, to a man that tells not his own case?
You though fears do abash, in you still possible hopes be:

But so unheard, condemned, kept thence we do seek to abide in,
Selfe-lost in wandering, banished that place we do come from,
What mean is there, alas, we can hope our loss to recover?
What place is there left, we may hope our woes to recomfort?

Air we do still with sighs increase, to the fire? we do want none.
And yet his outward heat our tears would quench, but an inward
Fire no liquor can cool: Neptunes realm would not avail us.
Happy shepherd, with thanks to the Gods, still think to be thankful,


Dorus. Unto the Gods with a thanckfull heart all thanks I do render,
That to my advancement their wisdoms have me abased.
But yet, alas! O but yet alas! our happs be but hard happs,

Well may a Pastor plain, but alas his plaints be not esteem'de
Silly shepherds poor pype, when his harsh sound testifi's anguish,
Into the fair looker on, pastime, not passion, enters.
And to the woods or brooks, who do make such dreery recital

Pleased to receive that name by rebounding answer of Echo,
May hope thereby to ease their inward horrible anguish,
When trees dance to the pype, and swift streams stay by the music,
Or when an Echo begins unmoved to sing them a love song.

(Since no estates be so base, but love vouchsafes his arrow,
Since no refuge does serve from wounds we do carry about us,
Since outward pleasures be but halting helps to decayed souls)
Save that daily we may discern what fire we do burn in.

Whose fair bodily gifts are framed most lovely to each ey.
Virtue you have, of virtue you have left proof to the whole world.
And virtue is grateful with bewty and richnes adorned,
Neither doubt you awhit, time will your passion utter.
Hardly remains fire hid, where skill is bent to the hiding,
But in a mind that would his flames should not be repressed,
Nature works enough with a small help for the revealing.
Give therefore to the Muse great praise in whose very likeness
You do approach to the fruit your only desir's be to gather.

Zelmane. First shall fertile grounds not yield increase of a good seed:
First the rivers shall cease to repay their fludds to the Occean:
First may a trusty Greyhounde transform himself to a Tigre:
First shall virtue be vice, and bewty be counted a blemishe,
Ere that I leave with song of praise her praise to solemnize,
Her praise, whence to the world all praise has his only beginning:
But yet well I do find each man most wise in his own case.
None can speak of a wound with skill, if he have not a wound felt.
Great to thee my state seems, thy state is blessed by my judgment:
And yet neither of us great or blessed deemeth his own self.
For yet (weigh this alas!) great is not great to the greater.
What judge you does a hillocke show, by the lofty Olympus?
Such my minute greatness, does seem compared to the greatest.
When Cedars to the ground fall down by the weight of an emmott,
Or when a rich rubies just price be the worth of a walnut,
Or to the Sun for wonders seem small sparks of a candle:
Then by my high Cedar, rich Ruby, and only shining Sun,
Virtue, richesse, beawties of mine shall great be reputed.
Oh no, no, worthy shepeheard, worth can never enter a title,
Where proofs justly do teach, thus matched, such worth to be naught worth,
Let not a puppet abuse thy sprite, Kings Crowns do not help them
From the cruel headache, nor shoes of gold do the gowt heal,
And preciouse couches full often are shook with a fever.
If then a boddily evil in a boddily gloze be not hidden,
Shall such morning deaws be an ease to the heat of a loves fire?

Dorus. O glittring miseries of man, if this be the fortune
Of those fortune lulls? so small rest rests in a kingdom?
What marvel tho a Prince transform himself to a Pastor?
Come from marble bowres many times the gay harbor of anguish,
Unto a silly caban, though weak, yet stronger against woes.
Now by thy words I begin, most famous Lady, to gather
Comfort into my soul I do find, I do find what a blessing
Is chanced to my life, that from such muddy abundance
Of carking agonies (to states which still be adherent)
Desteny keeps me aloof, for if all this state to thy virtue
Joined, by thy beauty adorned be no means these greefes to abolish:
If neither by that help, thou can clime up to thy fancy,
Nor yet fancy so dressed do receive more plausible hearing:
Then do I think in deed, that better it is to be private
In sorrows torments, then, tied to the pompes of a palace,
Nurse inward maladyes, which have not scope to be breathed out^
But perforce digest, all bitter ioyces of horror

Better yet do I live, that though by my thoughts I be plunged
Into my lives bondage, yet may disburden a passion
(Oppressed with ruinouse conceits) by the help of an outcrye:
Not limited to a whispringe note, the Lament of a Courtier.

With bold clamor unheard, vnmarckt, what I seek what I suffer:
And when I mee^e these trees, in the earths fair liuory clothed,
Ease I do feel (such ease as falls to one wholly diseased)
For that I find in them part of my state represented.
Laurel shows what I seek, by the Mirre is showed how I seek it,
Olive paintes me the peace that I must aspire to by the conquest:
Myrtle makes my request, my request is crowned with a willowe?
Cyprus promises help, but a help where comes no recomforte
Sweet Juniper, says this, thoh I burn, yet I burn in a sweet fire.
Evve does make me think what kind of bow the boy holds
Which shootes strongly with out any noise and deadly without smarte^
Firr trees great and green, sixth on a hye hill but a barrein,
Like to my noble thoughts, still new, well placed, to me fruteles.
Fig that yeeldes most pleasante fru'te, his shadow is hurtefull

Now in a palm when I mark, how he does rise under a burden,
And may I not (say I then) get up though griefs be so weighty?
Pine is a maste to a ship, to my ship shall hope for a maste serve,
Pine is hye, hope is as hie, sharp leau'd, sharp yet be my hopes budds^

Popler changes his hew from a rising sun to a setting:
Thus to my son do I yield, such looks her beams do aforde me
Old aged oak cut down, of new works serves to the building:
So my desires by my fear, cut down, be the frames of her honor.

Palms do rejoice to be joined by the match of a male to a female,
And shall sensiue things be so senseless as to resist sense?
Thus be my thoughts dispersed, thus thinking nurseth a thinking,
Thus both trees and each thing else, be the books of a fancy.

Then do I shape to my self that form which raign's so with in me,
And think there she do dwell and hear what plants I do utter:
When that noble top does nodd, I believe she salutes me;
When by the wind it makes a noise, I do think she does answer:

Only Iuell, O only Iuell, which only deseruest
That men's hearts be thy seat and endless fame be thy servant,
O descend for a while, from this great height to behold me,
But naught else do, behold (else is naught worth the beholding)
Save what a work, by thy self is wrought: and since I am altered
Thus by thy work, disdain not that which is by thy self done.
In mean caves often treasure abides, to an hostry a king comes.
And so behind foul clouds full often fair stars do ly hidden.

Zelmane. Hardy shephearde, such as thy meritts, such may be her insight
Justly to grant thee reward, such e^uie I bear to thy fortune.
But to my self what wish can I make for a salve to my sorrows,
Whom both nature seems to debarr from means to be helped,
And if a mean were found, fortune the whole course of it hinders.
This plag'de how can I frame to my soar any hope of amendment?
Whence may I show to my mind any light of possible escape?
Bownd and bownd by so noble bands, as loath to be vnbownd,
Iaylor I am to my self, prison and prisoner to mine own self.
Yet be my hopes thus plast, here fixed lives all my recomforte,
That that dear Dyamond, where wisdom holds a sure seat,
Whose force had such force so to transform, nay to reform me,
Will at length perceive these flames by her beams to be kindled,
And will pity the wound festred so strangely within me.
O be it so, grant such an event, O Gods, that event give.
And for a sure sacrifice I do daily oblation offer
Of mine own heart, where thoughts be the temple, sight is a altar.
But cease worthy shepherd, now cease we to weery the hearers
With monefull melodies, for enough our greefes be revealed,
If by the parties meant our meanings rightly be marked,
And sorrow's do require some respitt unto the senses.



What exclaming praises Basilius gave to this Ecloge any man may guess, that
Zelmane having heard some of the shepherds by chance name Strephon and
Klaius, supposing thereby they had been present, was desirous Basilius, that
any desire of his mistress should be unsatisfied, and therefore to represent
them unto her (as well as in their absence it might be) he commanded on Lamon,
who had at large set down their country pastimes and first love to Urania to
sing the whole discourse

A Shepherds tale no height of style desires
To raise in words what in effect is low:
A plaining song plaine-singing voice requires,
For warbling notes from inward chearing flow.
I then, whose burd'ned breast but thus aspires
Of shepherds two the seely case to show,
Need not the stately Muses help inuoke
For creeping rimes, which often sighings choke.
But you, o you, that think not tears to dear

And deigne to deem your neighbors mischefe near,
Although they be of meaner parents got:
You I inuit with easy ears to hear
The poore-clad truth of loves wrong-ordred lot.

Who share in woe, weygh others have as much.
There was (o seldom blessed word of was!)
A pair of friends, or rather one called two,
Trained in the life which on short-bitten grass

He, that the other in some years did pass,
And in those gifts that years distribute do,
Was Klaius called, (ah Klaius, woeful wight!)
The later borne, yet too soon, Strephon hight.
Epeirus high, was honest Klaius nest,
To Strephon AEoles land first breathing lent:
But East and West were ioin'd by frendships hest.
As Strephons ear and heart to Klaius bent:
So Klaius soul did in his Strephon rest.

As if they would of owners humor be,
And eke their pipes did well, as friends agree.
Klaius for skill of hearb's and shepherds art
Among the wisest was accounted wise,

Strephon was young, yet marked with humble eyes
How elder ruled their flocks, and cured their smart,
So that the grave did not his words despise.
Both free of mind, both did clear-dealing love,

Their cheerful minds, till pois'ned was their cheer,
The honest sports of earthy lodging prove;
Now for a clod-like hare in fourm they peer,
Now bolt and cudgill squirrels leap do move.

They catch, while he (fool!) to himself makes love:
And now at keels they try a harmles chance,
And now their curr they teach to fetch and dance.
When merry May first early calls the morn,

Then do they pull from sharp and niggard thorn
The plenteous sweets, (can sweets so sharply grow?)
Then some grene gowns are by the lasses worn
In chastest plays, till home they walk a row,
While dance about the may pole is begun,
When, if need were, they could at quintain run:
While thus they ran a low, but leaueld race,
While thus they lived, (this was indede a life)
With nature pleased, content with present case.
Free of proud fears, brave begg'ry, smiling strife
Of clime-fall Court, the enuy-hatching place:
While those restles desires in great men rife
To visit so low folks did much disdain,
This while, though poor, they in themselves did reign.
One day (o day, that shin'de to make them dark!)
While they did ward sunbeams with shady bay,
And Klaius taking for his yongling carke,
(Lest greedy eyes to them might challenge lay)
Busy with oker did their shoulders mark,
(His mark a Pillar was deuoid of stay,
As bragging that free of all passions moan
Well might he others bear, but lean to none)
Strephon with leauy twiggs of Laurel tree
A garland made on temples for to wear,
For he then chosen was the dignity
Of village-Lord that whitsontide to bear:
And full, poor fool of boyish bravery
With triumphs shows would show he naught did fear.
But fore-accounting often makes builders miss,
They found, they felt, they had no lease of bliss.
For ere that either had his purpose done,
Behold (beholding well it does deserve)
They saw a maid who thitherward did run,
To catch her sparrow which from her did swerue,
As she a black-silke cap on him begun
To set, for foil of his milke-white to serve.
She chirping ran, he peeping flew away,
Till hard by them both he and she did stay.
Well for to see they kept themselves unseen,
And saw this fairest maid of fairer mind,
By, fortune meare, in Nature borne a Queen,
How well apaid she was her bird to find:
How tenderly her tender hands between
In iuory cage she did the micher bind:
How rosy moist'ned lips about his beak
Moving, she seemed at once to kiss, and speak.
Chastned but thus, and thus his lesson tought
The happy wretch she putt into her breast,
Which to their eyes the bowls of Venus brought,
For they seemed made even of skie-mettall best,
And that the bias of her blood was wrought.
Betwixt them two the peeper took his nest,
Where snugging well he well appeared content

This done, but done with captiue-killing grace,
Each motion seeming shot from beauties bow,
With length laid down she decked the lonely place.
Proud grew the grass that under her did grow,

But she on elbow leaned with sigh's did show
No grass, no trees, nor yet her sparrow might
To long-perplexed mind breed long delight.
She troubled was (alas that it might be!)

Who would have her in will and word agree
To wedd Antaxius their neighbor near.
A heardman rich of much account was he
In whom no evil did reign, nor good appear.

Feign would be free, but dreadeth parents ire.
Kindly, sweet soul, she did unkindness take
That bagged baggage of a misers mudd,
Should price of her, as in a market, make.
But gold can guild a rotten piece of wood,

To strive she feared how it with virtue stood.
This doubting clouds ore-casting heavenly brain,
At length in rows of Kisse-cheeke tears they rain.
Cupid the wagg, that lately conquered had
Wise Counselors, stout Captains puissant Kings,
And ti'de them fast to lead his triumph badd,
Glutted with them now plays with meanest things.
So often in feasts with costly chaunges cladd

So Lords with sport of Stagg and Hearon full
Sometimes we use small birds from nests do pull.
So now for pray these shepherds two he took
Whose metal stiff he knew he could not bend

With one good dawnce, or letter finely pend,
That were in Court a well proportioned hook,
Where piercing wits do quickly apprehend,
Their senses rude plain objects only move,

Therefore Love armed in her now takes the field,
Making her beams his bravery and might:
Her hands which pierced the souls seau'n-double shield,
Were now his darts leaving his wonted fight.
Brave crest to him her scorn-gold hair did yield,
His complete harneis was her purest white.
But fearing lest all white might seem too good,
In cheeks and lips the Tyran threatens blood.
Besides this force within her eyes he kept
A fire, to burn the prisoners he gains,
Whose boiling heat increased as she wept:
For even in forge cold water fire maintains.
Thus proud and fierce unto the hearts he stepped
Of them poor souls: and cutting Reasons raines,
Made them his own before they had it wist.
But if they had, could shephookes this resist?
Klaius straight felt, and groned at the blow,
And called, now wounded, purpose to his aid:
Strephon, fond boy, delighted did not know,
That it was Love that shin'de in shining maid:
But lickrous, Poisoned, feign to her would go,
If him new-learned manners had not stayed.
For then Urania homeward did arise,
Leaving in pain their wel-fed hungry eyes.
She went, they staid; or rightly for to say,
She staid in them, they went in thought with her:
Klaius in deed would feign have pulled a way
This mote from out his eye, this inward burre,
And now, proud Rebel began for to gainsay
The lesson which but late he learned too furre:
Meaning with absence to refresh the thought
To which her presence such a fever brought.
Strephon did leap with joy and iolitie,
Thinking it just more therein to delight
Then in good Dog, fair field, or shading tree.
So have I seen trim books in velvet dight
With golden leaves, and painted babery
Of seely boys please unacquainted sight:
But when the rod began to play his part,
Feign would, but could not fly from golden smart.
He quickly learned Urania was her name,
And straight for failing, grau'd it in his heart:
He knew her haunt, and haunted in the same,
And taught his sheep her sheep in food to thwart.
Which soon as it did batefull question frame,
He might on knees confess his faulty part,
And yield himself unto her punishment,
While naught but game, the selfe-hurt wanton meant.
Nay even unto her home he often would go,
Where bold and hurtles many play he tries,
Her parents liking well it should be so,
For simple goodness shined in his eyes.
There did he make her laugh in spite of woe,

While into none doubt of his love did sink,
For not himself to be in love did think.
But glad Desire, his late embosom'd guest,
Yet but a babe, with milk of Sight he nursed:

Like dropsy folk still drink to be a thyrst.
Till one fair eau'n an howr ere Sun did rest,
Who then in Lions cave did enter first,
By neighbors prayed she went abroad thereby.

Never the earth on his round shoulders bare
A maid trained up from high or low degree,
That in her doings better could compare
Mirth with respect, few words with curtesy,

Self-gard with mildnes, Sport with Majesty:
Which made her yield to deck this shepherds band,
And still, believe me, Strephon was at hand.
A field they go, where many lookers be,
Klaius them among:
In deed thou said it was thy friend to see
Strephon, whose absence seemed unto thee long,
While most with her he less did keep with thee.
No, no, it was in spite of wisdoms song

The heau'n-loue lodestone drew thy iron heart.
Then couples three be straight allotted there,
They of both ends the middle two do fly,
The two that in mid place, Hell called were,

To catch of them, and them to hell to bear,
That they, as well as they, Hell may supply:
Like some which seek to salve their blotted name
With others blott, till all do taste of shame.

Do coupled toward either couple make,
They false and fearful do their hands undo,
Brother his brother, friend does friend forsake,
Heeding himself, cares not how fellow do,

As perjured cowards in adversity
With sight of fear from friends to fremb'd do fly.
These sports shepherds deuiz'd such faults to show.
Geron, though old yet gamesome, kept one end
With Cosma, for whose love Pas past in woe.
Fair Nous with Pas the lot to hell did send:
Pas thought it hell, while he was Cosma fro.
At other end Vran did Strephon lend
Her happy-making hand, of whom one look
From Nous and Cosma all their beauty took.
The play began: Pas durst not Cosma chase,
But did entend next bout with her to meet,
So he with Nous to Geron turned their race,
With whom to join fast ran Urania sweet:
But light-legd Pas had got the middle space.
Geron straue hard, but aged were his feet,
And therefore finding force now faint to be,
He thought gray hairs afforded subtletie.
And so when Pas hand-reached him to take,
The fox on knees and elbowes tombled down:
Pas could not stay, but over him did rake,
And crowned the earth with his first touching crown:
His heels grow'n proud did seem at heaven to shake.
But Nous that slipped from Pas, did catch the clown.
So laughing all, yet Pas to ease some dell
Geron with Vran were condemned to hell.
Cosma this while to Strephon safely came,
And all to second barly-brake are bent:
The two in hell did toward Cosma frame,
Who should to Pas, but they would her prevent.
Pas mad with fall, and madder with the shame,
Most mad with beams which he thought Cosma sent,
With such mad haste he did to Cosma go,
That to her breast he gave a noisome blow.
She quick, and proud, and who did Pas despise,
Up with her fist, and took him on the face,
Another time; quoth she, become more wise.
Thus Pas did kiss her hand with little grace,
And each way luckles, yet in humble guise
Did hold her fast for fear of more disgrace,
While Strephon might with preatie Nous have met,
But all this while another course he fet.
For as Urania after Cosma ran,
He ravished with sight how gracefully
She moved her lims, and drew the aged man,
Left Nous to coast the loved beauty ny.
Nous cri'de, and chafed, but he no other can.
Till Vran seeing Pas to Cosma fly,
And Strephon single, turned after him.
Strephon so chased did seem in milk to swim.
He ran, but ran with eye ore shoulder cast,
More marking her, then how himself did go,
Like Numid Lions by the hunters chased,

With proud aspect, disdaining greater have.
What rage in them, that love in him did show.
But God gives them instinct the man to shun,
And he by law of Barly-brake must run.

Much more his sight encreast his hot desire:
So is in her the best of Nature spent,
The air her sweet race moved does blow the fire.
Her feet be Purseuants from Cupid sent,

The hidden beauties seemed in wait to lie,
To down proud hearts that would not willing dye.
Thus, fast he fled from her he followed sore,
Still shunning Nous to lengthen pleasing race,
Geron could no more,
Then did he slack his loue-enstructed pace.
So that Vran, whose arm old Geron bore,
Laid hold on him with most lay-holding grace.
So caught, him seemed he caught of joys the bel^,

To hell he goes, and Nous with him must dwell.
Nous swear it was no right; for his default
Who would be caught, that she should go to hell:
But so she must. And now the third assault

Pas Cosma matched, yet angry with his fault,
The other end Geron with Vran guard.
I think you think Strephon bent thitherward.
Nous counseld Strephon Geron to pursue,

But he drew her as love his fancy drew,
And so to take the gemme Urania sought.
While Geron old came safe to Cosma true,
Though him to meet at all she sturred naught.
Pas, whither it were for fear, or love,
Moved not himself, nor suffered her to move.
So they three did together idly stay,
While dear Vran, whose course was Pas to meet
, (He staying thus) was feign abroad to stray

Strephon, whose eyes on her back-parts did play,
With love drawn on, so fast with pace unmeet
Drew dainty Nous, that she not able so
To run, brake from his hands, and let him go.
He single thus, hoped soon with her to be,
Who nothing earthly, but of fire and air,
Though with soft legs, did run as fast as he.
He thrice reached, thrice deceived, when her to bear
He hopes, with dainty turns she does him flee.
So on the down's we see, near Wilton fair,
A hast'ned Hare from greedy Grayhound go,
And past all hope his chapps to frustrate so.
But this strange race more strange conceits did yield:
Who victor seemed, was to his ruin brought:
Who seemed orethrown was mistress of the field:
She fled, and took: he folow'd, and was cought.
So have I heard to pierce pursuing shield
By Parents trained the Tartars wild are tought,
With shafts shot out from their back-turned bow.
But, ah! her darts did far more depely go.
As Venus bird the white, swift, lovely Dove
(O happy Dove that art compared to her!)
Does on her wings her utmost swiftnes prove,
Finding the gripe of Falcon fierce not furr:
So did Vran, the narr the swifter move,
(Yet beauty still as fast as she did stir)
Till with long race dear she was breathles brought,
And then the Phoenix feared to be cought.
Among the rest that there did take delight
To see the sportes of double-shining day,
And did the tribute of their wondering sight
To Natures heir, the fair Urania, pay,
I told you Klaius was the haples wight
Who earnest found what they accounted play.
He did not there do homage of his eyes,
But on his eyes his heart did sacrifise.
With gazing looks, short sighs, unsettled feet,
He stood, but turned, as Girosol, to Sun:
His fancies still did her in halfway meet,
His soul did fly as she was seen to run.
In sum proud Boreas never ruled fleet
(Who Neptunes webb on dangers distaff spun)
With greater power, then she did make them wend
Each way, as she, that ages praise, did bend.
Till spieng well she welnigh weary was,
And surely taught by his loue-open eye,
His eye, that even did mark her trodden grass,
That she would feign the catch of Strephon fly,
Giving his reason pasport for to pass
Whither it would, so it would let him die,
He that before shund her to shun such harms,
Now runs, and takes her in his clipping arms.
For with pretense from Strephon her to guard,

With inbow'd bosom well for her prepared,
When Strephon cursing his own backwardnes
Came to her back, and so with double ward
Emprison her, who both them did possess

Virtues proof, fortunes victor, beauties place.
Her race did not her beauties beams augment,
For they were ever in the best degree,
But yet a setting forth it some way lent:

The dainty dew on face and body went
As on sweet flowrs when mornings drops we see.
Her breath then short seemed loath from home to pas,
Which more it moved, the more it sweeter was.

To see her eyes, with how true humblenes
They looked down to triumph over pride:
With how sweet sawes she blamed their sawcines:
To feel the panting heart, which through her side

To see, to feel, to hear, to taste, to know
More then, besides her, all the earth could show.
But never did Medeas golden weed
On Creons child his poison sooner throw,

A creeping serpentlike of mortal woe.
Till she brake from their arms (although in deed
Going from them, from them she could not go)
And fare-welling the flock did homeward wend,

It ended, but the others woe began,
Began at least to be conceived as woe,
For then wise Klaius found no absence can
Help him, who can no more her sight foregoe.

And part must follow where whole man does go.
He found that Reasons self now reasons found
To fasten knotts, which fancy first had bound.
So does he yield, so takes he on his yoke,

Strephon, poor youth, because he saw no smoke
Did not conceive what fire he had within.
But after this to greater rage it broke;
Till of his life it did full conquest win,
First killing mirth, then banishing all rest,
Filling his eyes with tears, with sighs his breast.
Then sports grew pains, all talking tediouse,
On thoughts he feeds, his looks their figure change,
The day seems long, but night is odious,
No sleeps, but dream's, no dream's, but visions strange,
Till finding still his evil increasing thus,
One day he with his flock abroad did raunge:
And coming where he hoped to be alone,
Thus on a hillock set, he made his moan.
Alas! what weights are these that lode my heart!
I am as dull as winter-sterued sheep,
Tir'de as a jade in ouerloden carte,
Yet thoughts do fly, though I can scarcely creep.
All visions seem, at every bush I start:
Drowsy am I, and yet can rarely sleep.
Sure I bewitched am, it is even that:
Late near a cross I met an ougly Cat.
For, but by charms, how fall these things on me,
That from those eyes where heavenly apples been,
Those eyes, which nothing like themselves can see,
Of fair Urania, fairer then a green,
Proudly bedeckt in Aprills liuory,
A shot unheard gave me a wound unseen?
He was invisible that hurt me so,
And none unvisible, but Spirits, can go.
When I see her, my sinews shake for fear,
And yet, dear soul, I know she hurts none:
Amid my flock with woe my voice I tear,
And, but bewitched, who to his flock would moan?
Her chery lips, milk hands, and golden hair
I still do see, though I be still alone.
Now make me think that there is not a fend,
Who hid in Angels shape my life would end.
The sportes wherein I wonted to do well,
Come she, and sweet the air with open breast,
Then so I fail, when most I would do well,
That at me so amazed my fellows jest:
Sometimes to her news of my self to tell
I go about, but then is all my best
Wry words, and stam'ring, or else doltish dombe,
Say then, can this but of enchantment come?
Nay each thing is bewitched to know my case:
The Nightingales for woe their songs refrain:
In river as I looked my pining face,
As pined a face as mine I saw again.
The courteous mountains grieved at my disgrace
Their snowy hair tear of in melting pain.
And now the dropping trees do weep for me,

But you my pipe, whilome my chief delight,
Till strange delight, delight to nothing ware;
And you my flock, care of my careful sight,
While I was I, and so had cause to care;

Made wolves (not inward wolves) my ewes to spare;
Go you not from your master in his woe:
Let it suffice that he himself forgo.
For though like wax, this magique makes me waste,

(Stolen from her young by thieves vnchoosing have)
He treble beas for help, but none can get:
Though thus, and worse, though now I am at last,
Of all the games that here ere now I met:

Till my eyes had their curse from blessed ^ine.
Be you with me while I unheard do cry,
While I do score my losses on the wind,
While I in heart my will write ere I die.

Still to be hers, about her aye to fly,
As this same sprite about my fancies blind,
Does daily ha^nt: but so, that mine become
As much more loving, as less combersome.

And yet I see her shine amid the cloud.
Alas! of ghostes I hear the ghastly cries:
Yet there, me seems, I hear her singing loud.
This song she singes in most commanding wise:

To make it self to my least look a slave:
Leave sheep, leave all, I will no piecing have.
I will, I will, alas! alas! I will:
Will thou have more? more have, if more I be.

Out shreaking pipe made of ^ome witched tree.
Go bawling curre, thy hungry maw go fill,
On yond foul flock belonging not to me.
With that his dog he henst his flock he cursed:

This said, this done, he raze even tired with rest,
With heart as careful, as with careless grace,
With shrinking legs, but with a swelling breast,
With eyes which threatened they would drown his face,
Fearing the worst, not knowing what were best,
And giving to his sight a wandering race,
He saw behind a bush where Klaius sat:
His well know'ne friend, but yet his unknown mate,
Klaius the wretch, who lately yelden was
To bear the bonds which Time nor wit could break,
(With blushing soul at sight of judgments glass,
While guilty thoughts accused his Reason weak)
This morn alone to lonely walk did pass,
With in himself of her dear self to speak,
Till Strephons planing voice him nearer drew,
Where by his words his self-like cause he knew.
For hearing him so often with words of woe
Urania name, whose force he knew so well,
He quickly knew what witchcraft gave the blow
Which made his Strephon think himself in hell.
Which when he did in perfect image show,
To his own wit, thought upon thought did swell,
Breeding huge storms with in his inward part,
Which thus breathed out with earthquake of his heart.
As Lamon would have proceeded, Basilius knowing, by the wasting of the torches
that the night also was far wasted, and withal remembering Zelmanes hurt,
asked Klaius till an other day. Which she, perceiving the song had already
worn out much time, and not knowing when Lamon would end, being even now
stepping over to a new matter, though much delig^ted with what was spoken,
willingly agreed unto. And so of all sides they went to recommend themselves to
the elder brother of death.

The end of the first Book.

IN these pastoral pastimes a great number of days were sent to follow their
flying predecessors, while the cup of poison (which was deeply tasted of this
noble company) had left no Gynecia (to whom rest was no ease) had left her
loathed lodging, and gotten her self into the solitary places those deserts
were full of, going up and down with such Gynecia, as to make her preserve a
course so long embraced by her? O deserts, deserts, how fita guest am I for
you, since my heart can people you with wild ravenous beasts, which in you are
wanting? O Virtue, where O imperfect proportion of reason, which can too much
foresee, and too little prevent. Alas, alas (said she) if there were but one
hope for all my pains, or but one excuse for all my faultiness. But wretch
that I am, my torment is beyond all succor, and my evil deserving does exceed
my evil fortune. For nothing else did my husband take this strange resolution
to live so solitarily: for nothing else have the winds Zelmane is such as can
answer my love; yet as sure I am, that this disguising must needs come for some
foretaken co^ceipt. And then, wretched Gynecia, where can thou find any small
ground plot for hope to dwell upon? No, no, it is Philoclea his heart is set
upon: it is my daughter I have borne to supplant me. But if it be so, the life
I have given thee (ungrateful Philoclea) I will sooner with these hands
bereave thee of, then my birth shall glory, she has bereaved me of my desires.
In shame there is no comfort, but to be beyond all bounds of shame.

Having spoken thus, she began to make a piteous war with her fair hair, when
she might hear (not far from her) an extremely doleful voice, but so
suppressed with

IN vain, mine Eyes, you labor to amend
With flowing tears your fault of hasty sight:
Since to my heart her shape you so did send;
That her I see, though you did lose your light.
In vain, my Heart, now you with sight are burnd,
With sighs you seek to cool your hot desire:
Since sighs (into mine inward furnace turned)
For bellows serve to kindle more the fire.
Reason, in vain (now you have lost my heart)
My head you seek, as to your strongest forte:
Since there mine eyes have played so false a part,
That to your strength your foes have sure resort.
Then since in vain I find were all my strife,
To this strange death I vainly yield my life.
The ending of the song served but for a beginning of new plaints, as if the
mind (oppressed with too heavy a burden of cares) was feign to discharge it
self of al sides, and as it were, paint out the hideousnes of the pain in all
sorts of colors. For the woeful person (as if the lute had evil joined with
the voice) threw it to the ground

Gynecia could not refrain to show her self, thinking such griefs could
serve fitly for nothing, but her own fortune. But as she came into the little
Arbor of this sorrowful music, her eyes met with the eyes of Zelmane, which
was the party that thus had indicted her self of misery: so that either of
them remained co^fused Zelmane fearing, least she had heard some part of those
complaints, which she had risen up that morning early of purpose, to breath out
in secret to her self. But Gynecia a great while stood still, with a kind of
dull amasement, looking steadfastly upon her: at length returning to some use of
her self, she began to ask Zelmane, what cause carried her so early abroad?
But as if the opening of her Zelmane, had opened some great flood-gate of
sorrow (whereof her heart could not abide the violent issue) she sanke to the
ground, with her hands over her face crying vehemently, Zelmane help me, O
Zelmane have pity on me. Zelmane ran to her, maruelling what sudden
sickness had thus possessed her: and beginning to ask her the cause of her
pain, and offering her service to be employed by her: Gynecia opening Zelmane,
Zelmane, (said she) do thou offer me physic, which art my only poison? Or
will thou do me service, which have already brought me into eternal slavery?
Zelmane then knowing well at what mark she shot, yet loath to enter into it;
Most excellent Lady (said she) you were best retire your self into Gynecia)
If I had retired my self into my self, when thou to me (unfortunate guest)
came to draw me from my self; blessed had I been, and no need had I had of
this counsel. But now alas, I am forced to fly to thee for succor, whom I
accuse of all my hurt; and make thee judge of my cause, who art the only author
of my Zelmane the more astonished, the more she understood her; Madam (said
she) whereof do you accuse me, that I will not clear my self? Or wherein may
I steed you, that you may not command me? Alas, answered Gynecia, what shall I
say more? Take pity of me, O Zelmane, but not as Zelmane, and disguise not
with me in words, as I know thou do in apparel.

Zelmane was much troubled with that word, finding her self brought to this
straight. But as she was thinking what to answer her; they might see old
Basilius pass hard by them, without ever seeing them: complaining likewise of
love very freshly; and ending his complaint with this song, Love having renewed
both his invention, and voice.

LEt not old age disgrace my high desire,
O heavenly soul, in human shape conteind:
Old wood in flam'de, does yield the brauest fire,
When younger does in smoke his virtue spend.
Ne let white hairs, which on my face do grow,
Seem to your eyes of a disgraceful hew:
Since whiteness does present the sweetest show,
Which makes all eyes do homage unto you.
Old age is wise and full of constant truth;
Old age well stayed from raunging humor lives:
Old age has known what ever was in youth:
Old age overcome, the greater honor gives.
And to old age since you your self aspire,
Let not old age disgrace my high desire.
Which being done, he looked very curiously upon himself, sometimes fetching a
little skippe, as if he had said, his strength had not yet forsaken him. But
Zelmane having in this time gotten some leisure to think for an answer;
looking upon Gynecya, as if she thought she did her some wrong: Madam (said
she) I am not acquainted with those words of disguising, neither is it the
profession of an Amazon, neither Zelmane (said Gynecia) I perceive you know
full little, how percing the eyes are of a true lover. There is no one beam
of those thoughts you have planted in me, but is able to discern a greater
cloud then you do go in. Seek not to conceal your self further Zelmane
brought to an exigent, when the king, turning his eyes that way through the
trees, perceived his wife and mistres together: so that framing the most lovely
countenance he could, he came straightway toward them; and at the first
word (thanking his wife for having entertained Zelmane,) desired her she
Zelmane. The Queen (being nothing troubled with jealousy in that point) obeyed
the kings commandment; full of raging agonies and determinately bent, that
as she would seek all loving means to win Zelmane, so she would stir up
terrible tragedies, rather then fail of her intent. And so went Zelmane;
having ever one of them entrusted

But as soon as Basilius was rid of his wives presence, falling down on his
knees, O Lady (said he) which have only had the power to stir up again
those flames which had so long layne dead in me; see in me the power of your
beauty, which can make old age come to ask counsel of youth; and a Prince
Zelmane, taking him up from his kneeling) both your manner, and your speech are
so strange unto me, as I know not how to answer it better then with silence.
If silence please you (said the king) it shall never displease me, since my
heart is wholly pledged to obey you: otherwise if you Zelmane,) but I disdain
to speak to any matter which may bring my honor into question. And therewith,
with a brave counterfeited scorn she departed from the king; leaving

But Zelmane being rid of this loving, but little-loued company, Alas (said
Pyrocles, was there ever one, but I, that had received wrong, and could blame
no body? that having more then I desire, am still in want of that I would?
Truly Love, I must needs say thus much on thy behalf; thou have employed my
love there, where all love is deserved; and for recompense have sent me more
love then ever I desired. But what will thou do Pyrocles? which way can thou
find Basilius? what shield against the violent passions of Gynecia? And if
that be done, yet how am I the nearer to quench the fire that consumes me?
Well, well, sweet Philoclea, my whole confidence must

But as sick folks, when they are alone, think company would relieve them,
and yet having company do find it noisome; changing willingly outward objects,
when indeed the evil is inward: So poor Zelmane was no more weery of
Basilius, Basilius was gone: and ever the more, the more she turned her eyes to
become her own judges. Tired wherewith, she longed to meet her friend Dorus;
that upon the shoulders of friendship she might lay the burden of sorrow: and
therefore went toward the other lodge: where among certain Beeches she found
Dorus, apparelled in flanen, with a Goats skin cast upon Dametas, who at that
time was teaching him how with his sheephooke to catch a wanton Lamb, and how
with the same to cast a little clod at any one that strayed out of company. And
while Dorus was practicing, one might see Dametas holding his hand under his
girdle behind him, nodding from the wast upwards, and

But Zelmanes coming saved Dorus from further chiding. And so she beginning to
speak with him of the number of his masters sheep, and which Province of
Arcadia bare the finest wool, drew him on to follow her in such country
discourses, till (being out of Dametas hearing) with such vehemency of
passion, as though her heart would clime into her mouth, to take her tongues
office, she declared Dorus (said she) thou see how long and languishingly the
weeks are past over us since our last talking. And yet am I the same,
miserable Dorus ears (not able to show what wounds that discourse gave unto
them) procured his eyes with tears to give testimony, how much they suffered
for her suffering: till passion (a most cumbersome guest to it self) made
Zelmane (the sooner to shake it off) earnestly Dorus, that he also (with like
freedom of discourse) would bestow a Map of his little world, upon her; that
she might see, whether it were troubled with such uninhabitable climes of cold
despaires, and hot rages, as hers was. And so walking under a few Palm trees,
(which being loving in their own nature, seemed to give their shadow the
willinglier, because they held discourse of love) Dorus Pamela, see how much
extraordinary devotion I bare to her service: and withal, straue to appear
more worthy in her sight; that small desert, joined to so great affection,
might prevail something in the wisest Lady. But too well (alas) I found, that
a shepherds service was but considered of as from a shepherd, and the
acceptance limited to no further proportion, then of Dametas, Miso, and my
young Mopsa. For, Dametas (according to the constitution of a dull head)
thinks no better way to show himself wise, then by suspecting every thing in
his way. Which suspicion Miso (for the hoggish shrewdness of her brain) and
Mopsa (for a very unlikely envy she has stumbled upon, against the Princesses
unspeakable beauty) were very glad to execute. So that I (finding my service
by this means lightly regarded, my affection despised, and my self unknown)
remained no fuller Mopsa, that might be: and as for the love, so lively it was
indeed within me, (although to another subject) that little I needed to
counterfeit any notable demonstrations Pamelas fayrenesse, still looking on
Mopsa, but thinking on Pamela; as if I saw my Sun shine in a puddled water:
I cried out of nothing but Mopsa: to Mopsa my attendance was directed: to Mopsa
the best fruits I could gather were brought: to Mopsa it seemed still that
mine eye conveyed my tongue. So that Mopsa was my saying; Mopsa was my singing;
Mopsa, (that is only suitable in laying a foul complexion upon a filthy
favor, setting forth both in sluttishnes) she was the load-starre of my life,
she the blessing of mine eyes, she the overthrow of my desires, and yet the
recompense of my overthrow; she the sweetness of my heart, even sweetning the
death, which her sweetness drew upon me. In sum, Pamela, that I said of
Mopsa; whereby as I gatte my masters good will, who before spited me, fearing
lest I should win the Princess favor from him, so did the same make the
Princess the better content to allow me her presence: whether indeed it were,
that a certain spark of noble indignation did rise in her, not to suffer such
a baggage to win away any thing of Mopsaes worthiness, she perceived well
enough, whither they were directed: and therefore being so masked, she was
contented, as a sport of wit to attend them. Whereupon one day determining
to find some means to tell (as of a third person) the tale of mine own love,
and estate, finding Mopsa (like a Cuckoo by a Nightingale) alone with Pamela, I
came in unto them, and with a face (I am sure) full of clowdy fancies, took a
harp, and soong this song.

SInce so mine eyes are subject to your sight,
That in your sight they fixed have my brain;
Since so my heart is filled with that light,
That only light does all my life maintain;
Since in sweet you all goods so richly reign,
That where you are no wished good can want;
Since so your living image lives in me,
That in my self your self true love does plant;
How can you him unworthy then decree,
In whose chief part your worthes implanted be?
The song being ended, which I had often broken of in the midst with grievous
sighs, which ouertooke every verse I sang, I let fall my harp from me; and
Mopsa, but settling my sight principally upon Pamela, And is it the only
fortune most bewtifull Mopsa (said I) of wretched Dorus, that fortune must be
the measure of his mind? Am I only he that because I am in misery, more
misery must be laid upon me? must that which should be cause of compassion,
become an argument of cruelty against me? Alas excellent Mopsa, Mopsa, Mopsa,
if my heart could be as manifest to you, as it is uncomfortable to me, I doubt
not the height of my thoughts should well counteruaile the lowness of my
quality. Who has not heard of the greatness of your estate? who sees not,
that your estate is Mopsa (who already had had a certain smackring toward me)
stood all this while with her hand sometimes before her face, but most commonly
with a certain special grace of her own, wagging her lips, and grinning in
steed of smiling: but all the words I could get of her, was, wrieng her waste,
and thrusting out her chinne, In faith you jest with me: you are Pamela (that
well found the Comedy would be marred, if she did not help Mopsa to her part)
was content to urge a little further of me. Master Dorus (said the fair
Pamela) me thinks you blame your fortune very wrongfully, since the fault is
not in Fortune, but in you that cannot frame your self to your fortune: and as
wrongfully do require Mopsa to so great words, in hope she would have continued
her speech (so great a delight I received in hearing her) but seeing her say no
further, (with a quaking all over my body) I thus answered her. Lady, most
worthy of all duty, how falls it out that you in whom all virtue shines,
will take the patronage of fortune, the only rebellious Pamela) but that the
love you bear to Mopsa, has brought you to the consideration of her virtues,
and that consideration may have made you the more virtuous, and so the more
worthy: But even that then (you must confess) you have received of her,
Dorus, I must in Mopsaes behalf say thus much to you, that if her beauties
have so overtaken you, it becomes a true Love to have your heart more set upon
her good then your own, and to bear a tenderer respect to her honor, then
your satisfaction. Mopsa, throwing a great number of sheeps eyes upon me) you
have even touched mine own mind to the quick, forsooth. I (finding that the
policy that I had used, had at lest wise procured thus much happiness unto
me, as that I might even in my Ladies presence, discover the sore which had
deeply festered within me, and that she could better conceive my Mopsa, then
she would have vouchsafed them, whilst her self was a party) thought good to
pursue on my good beginning, using this fit occasion of Pamelaes wit, and
Mopsaes ignorance. Therefore with an humble pearcing eye, looking upon Pamela,
as if I had rather been condemned by her mouth, then highly exalted by the
other, turning my self to Mopsa, but keeping Mopsa (said I) well do I find
by the wise knitting together of your answer, that any disputation I can use
is as much too weak, as I unworthy. I find my love shall be proved no love,
without I leave to love, being too unfit a vessel in whom so high thoughts
should be engraued. Yet since the Love I bear you, has so joined it self to
the best part of my life, as the one can Mopsa was about to say, in neither;
for her heart I think tumbled with overmuch kindness, when Pamela with a more
favorable countenance then before (finding how apt I was to fall into
despair) told me, I might therein have answered my Mopsaes perfections had
greatly beautified my mind, there was none could deny, but that my mind and
body deserved great allowance. But Dorus (said she) you must be so far
master of your love, as to consider, that since the judgment of the world
stands upon matter of fortune, and that the sex of womankind of all other is
most bound to have regardfull eye to men's judgments, it is not for us to play
the philosophers, in seeking out your hidden virtues: since that, which in a
wise prince would be counted wisdom, in us will be taken for a light-grounded
affection: so is not Pamela graciously harkened, and I told my tale in this
sort.

In the country of Thessalia, (alas why name I that accursed country, which
brings forth nothing, but matters for tragedies? but name it I must) in
Thessalia Musidorus. O Musidorus, Musidorus; but to what serve exclamations,
where there are no ears to receive the sound? This Musidorus, being yet in the
tendrest age, his worthy father paid to nature (with a violent death) her last
duties, leaving his child to the faith Musidorus (being thus,

But when the time now came, that misery seemed to be ripe for him, because
matters in foretime were odious) began to wish in their beloved Prince,
experience by travail: his dear mother (whose eyes were held open, only with
the joy of looking upon him) did now dispense with the comfort of her widowhead
life, desiring the same her subjects did, for the increase of her sons
Musidorus own virtue (see how virtue can be a minister to mischief)
sufficiently provoke him: for indeed thus much I must say for him, although the
likeness of our mishaps makes me presume to pattern my self unto him) that
well-doing was at that time his scope, from which no faint pleasure could
withold him. But the present occasion which did knit all this together,
Macedon; who having lately before gotten such victories, as were beyond
expectation, did at this time send both for the Prince his son (brought up
together, to avoid the wars, with Musidorus) and for Musidorus himself, that
his joy might be the more full, having such partakers of it. But alas, to what
a sea of miseries my plaintfull tongue does lead me; and thus out of breath,
rather with Pamela showing by countenance that such was her pleasure, I thus
continued it. These two young Princes to satisfy the king, took their way by
sea, toward Thrace, whether they would needs go with a Navy to succor him:
he being at that time before Bizantium with a mighty Army beseeging it; where at
that time his court was. But when the co^spired heavens had gotten Macedon his
cose^ I should too much fill your ears with strange horrors; neither will I
stay upon those laborsome adventures, nor loathsome misaduentures to which, and
through which his fortune and courage co^ducted him; My speech hastneth it
self to come to the fulpoint Musidorus infortunes. For as we find the most
pestilent diseases do gather into themselves all the infirmities with which the
body before was annoyed; so did his last misery embrace in the extremity of it
self all his former mischiefs.

Arcadia, Arcadia was the place prepared to be the stage of his endless
ouer-throw. Arcadia was, (alas well might I say it is) the charmed circle, where
all his spirits for ever Arcadian Kings eldest daughter in whom he forthwith
placed so all his hopes of joy, and joyful parts of his heart, that he left in
himself nothing, but a maze of longing, and a dungeon of sorrow. But alas what
can saying make them

In this entangled case, he clothed himself in a shepherds vveede, that
under taking on a shepherds look cast up his eyes to the fairest Princess
Nature in that time created; the like, nay the same desire of mine need no
more to be disdained, or held for disgraceful. But now alas mine eyes wax
dim, my tongue begins to falter, and my heart to want force to help, either
with the feeling remembrance I have, in what heap of miseries the caitife
Prince lay at this time buried. Pardon

Thus having delivered my tale in this perplexed manner, to the end the
Princess might judge that he meant himself, who spoke so feelingly; her
answer was both strange, and in some respect comfortable. For would you
think it? she has heard heretofore of us both, by means of the valiant
Prince Plangus, and particularly of our casting away: which she (following my
own style) thus delicately Dorus, a pretty tale; but you are much deceived in
the latter end of it. For the prince Musidorus with his cosen Pyrocles did both
perish upon the coast of Laconia; as a noble gentleman, called Plangus (who was
well acquainted with the history) did assure my father. O how that speech of
hers did pour joys in my heart? o blessed name (thought I) of mine, since thou
Pyrocles (said I) I will not deny it, but that he is perished: (which I said,
least sooner suspicion might arise of your being here, then your self would
have it) and yet affirmed no lie unto her, since I only said, I would not deny
it. But for Musidorus (said I) I perceive indeed you have either heard or read
the story Plangus might easily be deceived: but that he himself was Laconia,
where he was taken up by a couple of shepheardes, who lived in those days
famous; for that both loving one fair maid, they yet remained constant
frinds; one of whose songs not long since was song before you by the shepherd
Lamon, and brought by them to a noble-mans house, near Mantinea, whose son
had a little before his marriage, been taken prisoner, and by the Musidorus
(though naming himself by an other name) was delivered. Now these
circumlocutions I did use, because of the one side I knew the Princess would
know well the parties I meant; and of the other, if I should have named
Strephon, Claius, Kalander, and Clitophon, perhaps it would have rubd some
conjecture into the heavy head of Mistress Mopsa.

And therefore (said I) most divine Lady, he justly was thus to argue against
such suspicions; that the Prince might easily by those parties be satisfied,
that upon that wrack such a one was taken up: and therefore that Plangus might
well err, who knew not of anies taking up again that he that was so
preserved, brought good tokens to be one of the two, chief of that wracked
company: which two since Plangus Musidorus and Pyrocles, he must needs be
one of them, although (as I said) upon a foretaken vow, he was otherwise at
that time called. Besides, the Princess must needs judge, that no less then
a Prince durst undertake such an enterprise, which (though he might get the
favor of the Princess) he conld never defend with less then a Princes power,
against the force of Arcadia. Lastly, (said he) for a certain demonstration,
he presumed to show unto the Princess a Mopsa: and withal, showed my neck to
them both, where (as you know) there is a red spotte, bearing figure (as they
tell me) of a Lions pawe, that she may ascertaine her self, that I am
Menalcas brother. And so did he, beseeching her to send some one she might
trust, into Thssalia, secretly to be advertised, whether the age, Musidorus.
Do you not know further (said she, with a settled countenance, not accusing
any kind of inward motion) of that story. Alas no, (said I) for even here the
Historiographer stopped, saying, The rest belonged to Astrology. And
therewith, thinking her silent imaginations began to work upon somewhat,

MY sheep are thoughts, which I both guide and serve:
Their pasture is fair hills of fruitless Love:

I wail their lotte, but will not other prove.
My sheepehooke is wanne hope, which all vpholdes:
My weeds, Desire, cut out in endless foldes.
What wool my sheep shall bear, whiles thus they live,

And then, partly to bring Mopsa again to the matter (lest she should too much
take heed to our discourses) but principally, if it were possible, to gather
some comfort out of her answeares, I kneeled down to the Princess, and
humbly besought Mopsa in my behalf, that she would unarm her noble heart of
that steely resistance against the sweet blows of Love: that since all her
parts were decked with some particular ornament; her face with beauty, her
head with wisdom, her eyes with majesty, her countenance with gracefulnes,
her lips with louelines, her tongue with victory; that she would make her
heart the throne of pity, being the

Pamela, without show either of favor or disdain, either of heeding or
neglecting what I had said, turned her speech to Mopsa, and with such a voice
and action, as might show she spoke of a matter which little did concern
her, Take heed to your self (said she) Mopsa, for your shepherd can speak
well: but truly, Menalchas his brother^ and heir I know no reason why you
should think scorn of him. Mopsa though (in my conscience) she were even
then far spent toward me, yet she answered her, that for all my queint
speeches, she would keep her honesty close enough: And that as for the way
of matrimony, she would weak lovers stomach. But Lord what a fool am I, to
mingle that driuels speeches among my noble thoughts? but because she was an
Actor in this Tragedy, to give you a full knowledge, and to leave nothing
(that I can remember) vnrepeated.

Now the Princess being about to withdraw her self from us, I took a Jewel
Mopsa, but bending to Pamela: The word about it was, By force, not choice; and
still kneeling, besought the Princess that she would vouchsafe to give it
Mopsa, and with the blessedness of her hand to make acceptable unto her that
toye which I had found, followinge of

Mopsa was benumbed with joy when the Princess gave it her: but in the
Princess I could find no apprehension of what I either said or did, but with
a calm Pamela, telling him, it was apparel I had gotten for playing well the
part of a King in a Tragedy at Athens: my horse indeed was it I had left at
Menalcas Dametas got one by friendship out of the Princes stable. But how
soever I show, I am no base body, all I do is but to beat a rock and get
foam.

But as Dorus was about to tell further, Dametas (who came whistling, and
counting upon his fingers, how many load of hay his seuenteen fat oxen eat up
in a year) Zelmane from the King that she would come into the lodge, where
they stayed for her. Alas (said Dorus, taking his leave) the sum is this, that
you may well find you have beaten your sorrow against such a wall, which with
the force of rebound may well make your sorrow stronger. But Zelmane turning
her speech to Dametas, I shall grow (said she) skillful in country matters,
if I have often conference Dametas with a graceless skorne) the Lad may prove
well enough, if he ouersoon think not too well of himself, and will bear
away that he hears of his elders. And therewith as they walked to the other
lodge, to make Zelmane find she might have spent her time better with him, he
began with a wild Method to run over all the art of husbandry: especially
employing his tongue about well dunging of a field: while poor Zelmane
Basilius, and Gynecia, who attended for her in a coach to carry her abroad to
see some sportes prepared for her. Basilius, and Gynecia sitting in the one
end, placed her at the other, with her left side to Philoclea. Zelmane was
moved in her mind, to have kissed their feet for the favor of so Zelmanes
soul cleave unto her, both through Zelmanes body stirring in her, as wine will
do when sugar is hastily put into it, seeking to suck the sweetness of the
beloved guest; her heart, like a lion new imprisoned, seeing him that restraines
his liberty, before the grate; not panting, but striving violently (if it had
been possible) to have leapt into the lap of Philoclea. Dametas, even then
proceeding from being master of a carte, to be doctor of a coach, not a
little proud in himself, that his whippe at that time guided the rule of
Arcadia, drove the coach (the cover whereof was made with such ioints, that as
they might (to avoid the weather) pull it up close when they listed, so when
they would they might put each end down, and remain as discovered Basilius
would principally show to Zelmane, was the mountie at a Hearne, which getting
up on his wagling wings with pain, till he was come to some height, (as
though the air next to the earth were not fit for his great body to fly
through) was now grown to diminish the sight of himself, and to give example
to great persons, that the higher they be, the

Diverse of which flights Basilius showing to Zelmane, thus was the richesse of
the time spent, and the day deceassed before it was thought of, till night like
a degenerating successor made his departure the better remembered. And
therefore (so constrained) they willed Dametas to drive homeward, who (half
sleeping, half musing about the mending of a wine press) guided the horses so
ill, that the Zelmane and Gynecia sat, yet for Zel^anes part, she would have
been glad of the fall, which made her bear the sweet burden of Philoclea,
but that she feared she might receive some hurt. But indeed neither she
did, nor any of the rest, by reason they kept their arms and legs within the
Gynecia, who with the only bruze of the fall had her shoulder put out of
ioinct; which though by one of the Faulkeners cunning, it was set well again,
yet with much pain was she brought to the lodge; and pain (fetching his
ordinary companion, a fever with him drove her to entertain them both in her
bed.

But neither was the fever of such impatient heat, as the inward plague sore
of Philoclea, lest this time of her sickness might give apt occasion to
Zelmane, whom she misdoubted. Therefore she called Philoclea to her, and
though it were late in the night, commanded her in her ear to go to the other
lodge, and send Miso to her, with whom she would speak, and she lie with her
sister Pamela. The mean Gynecia kept Zelmane with her, because she would be
sure, she should be out of the lodge, before she licenced Zelmane. Philoclea
not skild in any thing better then obedience, went quietly down; and the Moon
then full (not thinking skorne to be a torch-bearer to such beauty) guided her
steps, whose motions bear a mind which bare in it self far more stirring
motions. And alas (sweet Philoclea) how

The sweet minded Philoclea was in their degree of well doing, to whom the not
knowing of evil serves for a ground of virtue, and hold their inward powers
in Philoclea (whose eyes and Zelmane had a while lived in the lodge with her,
and that her only being a noble stranger had bred a kind of heedfull
attention; her coming to that lonely place (where she had no body but her
parents) a willingness of conversation; her wit and behavior, a liking and
silent Philoclea, (carrying thus in one person the only two bands of good will,
louelines and louingnes) brought forth in her heart a yielding to a most
friendly affection; which when it had gotten so full possession of the keys of
her mind, that it would receive no message from her senses, without that
affection were the interpreter; then straight grew an exceeding delight Zelmane
did: matters being so turned in her, that where at first, liking her manners
did breed good will, now good will became the chief cause of liking her
manners: so that within a while Zelmane was not prized for her demeanure, but
the demeanure was prized because it was Zelmanes. Then followed that most
natural effect of conforming Zelmanes doings, speeches, and fashions, and to
take them into her self, as a pattern of worthy proceeding. Which when once
it was enacted, not only by the comminaltie of Passions, but agreed Zelmane
did often eye her, Zelmane; and as Zelmanes eyes would deliver a submissiue,
but vehement desire in their look, she, though as yet she had not the desire
in her, yet should her eyes answer in like pearcing kindness of a look.
Zelmane as much as Gynecias jealousy would suffer, desired to be near
Philoclea; Philoclea, as much as Gynecias jealousy would suffer, desired to be
near Zelmane. If Zelmane took her Zelmane sighed, she would sigh also; when
Zelmane was sad, she deemed it wisdom, and therefore she would be sad too.
Zelmanes languishing countenance with crossed arms, and sometimes cast-vp eyes,
she thought to have an excellent grace: and Zelmanes friendship was full of
impatient desire, having more then ordinary limits, and therefore she was
content to second Zelmane, though Dianas Nymphs. But that wish, she thought
not sufficient, because she knew, there would be more Nymphs besides them, who
also would have their part in Zelmane. Then Zelmane a man, that there might
succeed a blessed marriage betwixt them. But when that wish had once displaied
his ensign in her where-out making did make her know her self the better by
the image of those fancies. But as some diseases when they are easy to be
cured, they are hard to be known, but when they grow easy to be known, they
are almost impossible to be cured: so the sweet Philoclea, while she might
prevent it, she did not feel it, now she felt it, when it was past preventing;
like a river, no rampires being built against Zelmane were present, she might
give passage to her thoughts, and so as it were utter out some smoke of those
Phoebus of looking upon her: There had she enjoyed her self often, while she
was mistress of her self, and had

But the principal cause that invited her remembrance, was a goodly white
marble stone, that should seem had been dedicated in ancient time to the
Siluan gods: which she finding there a few days before Zelmanes coming, had
written these words upon it, as a testimony of her mind, against the suspicion
her captivity

YOu living powers enclosed in stately shrine
Of growing trees: you rural Gods that wield
Your scepters here, if to your ears divine
A voice may come, which troubled soul does yield:
This vow receive, this vow o Gods maintain;
My virgin life no spotted thought shall stain.
Thou purest stone, whose pureness does present
My purest mind; whose temper hard does show
My tempred heart; by thee my promise sent
Unto my self let after-liuers know.
No fancy mine, nor others wrong suspect
Make me, o virtuous Shame, thy laws neglect.

Which makst us most immortal shape to wear,
Hold thou my heart, establish thou my sprights:
To only thee my constant course I bear.
Till spotless soul unto thy bosom fly,

But now that her memory served as an accuser of her change, and that her own
handwriting was there, to bear testimony against her fall; she went in among
those few trees, so closed in the tops together, as they might seem a little
chapel:

MY words, in hope to blaze my steadfast mind,
This marble chose, as of like temper known:
But lo^, my words defaste, my fancies blind,

And witness am, how ill agree in one,
A woman's hand with constant marble stone.
My words full weak, the marble ^ull of might;

My words black ink, the marble kindly white;
My words unseen, the marble still in sight,
May witness bear, how ill agree in one,
A woman's hand, with constant marble stone.
her sight and the moon, O Diana (said she) I would either the cloud that now
hides the light of my virtue would as easily pass away, as you will quickly
overcome this let; or else that you were for ever thus darkened, to serve for an
excuse of my outrageous folly. Then looking to the stars, which had perfitly
as then beautified the clear sky: My parents (said she) have told me, that in
these fair Philoclea) it is the impossibility that does torment me: for,
unlawful desires are punished after the effect of enjoying; Zelmane? And
should I be wiser then my mother? Either she sees a possibility in that which
I think impossible, or else impossible loves need not misbecome me. And do I
not see Zelmane (who does not think a thought which is not first wayed by
wisdom and virtue) does not she vouchsafe to love me with like ardour? I see
it, Zelmane? Away then all vain examinations of why and how. Thou love me,
excellent Zelmane, and I love thee: and with that, embrasing the very ground
whereon she lay, she said to her self (for even to her self she was ashamed
to speak it out in words) O my Zelmane, govern and direct

In this depth of muzes, and diverse sorts of discourses, would she rauingly
have remained, but that Dametas and Miso (who were round about to seek her,
understanding she was to come to their lodge that night) came hard by her;
Dametas saying, That he would not deal in other bodies matters; but for his
part, he did not Miso swearing that if it were her daughter Mopsa, she would
give her a lesson for walking so late, that should make her keep within doors
for one fortnight. But their iangling made Philoclea rise, and pretending as
though she had done it but to Miso to wait upon her mother) to the lodge;
where (being now accustomed by her parents discipline, as well as her sister,
to serve her self) she went alone up to Pamelas chamber: where meaning to
delight her eyes, and joy her thoughts with the sweet conversation of her
beloved sister, she found her (though it were in the time that the wings of
night does blow sleep most willingly into mortal creatures) sitting in a
chair, lying Philoclea finding (for her eyes had learned to know the badges of
sorrow) she earnestly Pamela, rather seeming sorry that she had perceived so
much, then willing to open any further, O my Pamela (said Philoclea) who are to
me a sister in nature, a mother in counsel, a Princess by the law of our
country, and which name (me think) of all other is the dearest, a friend by
my choice Pamela, so well as a joyful? Or be my ears unworthy, or my tongue
suspected? What is it (my sister) that you should conceal from your sister,
yea and servant Philoclea? These words wanne no further of Pamela, but that
telling her they Venus: and there cherishing one another with dear, though
chaste embracements; with sweet, though cold kisses; it might seem that Love
was come to play him there without darte; or that weerie of his own fires, he
was there to refresh himself between Philoclea earnestly again entreated
Pamela to open her grief; who (drawing the curtain, that the candle might not
complain of her blushing) was ready to speak: but the breath almost formed
into words, was again stopped by her, and turned into sighs. But at last, I
pray you (said she) sweet Philoclea, let us talk of some other thing: and
tell me whether you did ever Dorus came hither? O Love, how far thou see
with blind eyes? Philoclea had straight found her, and therefore to draw out
more, In deed (said she) I have often wondered to my self how such excellencies
could be in so mean a person; but belike Fortune was afraid to lay her
treasures, where they should be staind with so many perfections: Dametas. Ah
(said Pamela) if you knew the cause: but no more do I neither; and to say the
truth: but Lord, how are we fallen to talk of this fellow? and yet indeed if
you were sometimes with me to mark him, while Dametas reads his rusticke
lecture unto him (how to feed his beasts before noone, where to shade Pamela
(said Philoclea) I have caught you, the constancy of your wit was not wont to
bring forth such disiointed speeches: you love, dissemble no further. It is
true (said Pamela) now you have it; and with less adoo should, if my heart
could have thought those words suitable for my mouth. But indeed (my Philoclea)
take heed: for I think Virtue it self is no armor of proof against
affection. Therefore learn by my example. Alas thought Philoclea to her self,
your sheares come too late to clip the birds wings that already is flowne away.
But then Pamela being once set in the stream of her love, went away amain
Mopsa, and Mopsa what soever he would have her know: and in how passionate
manner he had told his own tale in a third person, making poor Mopsa believe,
that it was a matter fallen out many ages before. And in the end, because you
shall know my tears come not, neither of repentance nor misery, who think
you, is my Dorus fallen out to be? even the Prince Musidorus, famous over all
Asia, for his Plangus told my father; he not being drowned (as Plangus thought)
though his cousin Pyrocles indeed perished. Ah my sister, if you had heard his
words, or seen his gestures, when he made me know what, and to whom his love
was, you would have matched in your self (those two rarely matched together)
pity and delight. Tell Dametas servant for my sake? you will say, but how
know Musidorus, since the handmaid of wisdom is slow belief? That
consideration did not want in me: for the nature of desire it self is no
easier to receive belief, then it is hard to ground belief. For as desire is
glad to embrace the first show of comfort, so is desire desirous of perfect
assurance: and that have I had of him, not only by necessary arguments to any
of common sense, but by sufficient Thessalia: but truly I am not as now in mind
to do my honorable Love so much wrong, as so far to suspect him: yet poor
soul knows he no other, but that I do both suspect, neglect, yea and detest
him. For every day he finds one way or other to set forth himself unto me, but
all are rewarded with like coldness of acceptance.

A few days since, he and Dametas had furnished themselves very richly to run
at the ring before me. O how mad a sight it was to see Dametas, like rich
Tissew furd with lambe-skins? But o how well it did with Dorus, to see with
what a grace he presented himself before me on horseback, making majesty
wait upon humblenes? how at the first, standing still with his eyes bent upon
me, as though his motions Mopsa bid him do something upon his horse: which no
sooner said, but (with a kind rather of quick gesture, then show of violence)
you might see him come toward me, beating the ground in so due time, as no
dancer can observe better measure. If you remember the ship we saw once, when
the Sea went hie upon the coast of Argos; so went the beast: But he his own
limbs: for though he had both spurs and wand, they seemed rather marks of
soueraintie, then instruments of punishment; his hand and leg (with most
pleasing grace) commanding without threatening, and rather remembering the^
chastising, at lest if sometimes he did, it was so stolen, as neither our eyes
could discern Dametas kiddes bound over the hillockes: and all so done, as
neither the lusty kind showed any roughness, nor the easier any idleness:
but still like a Dametas, how he was tossed from the saddle to the mane of the
horse, and thence to the ground, giving his gay apparel almost as foul an
outside, as it had an inside. But as before he had ever Dorus was feign alone
to take the Ringe. Wherein truly at lest my womanishe eyes could not discern,
but that taking his staff from his thigh, the descending it a little down,
the getting of it up into Dametas found fault that he showed no more strength
in shaking of his staff: but to my conceit the fine cleenes of bearing it was
exceeding

But how delightful soever it was, my delight might well be in my soul, but
it never went to look out of the window to do him any comfort. But how much
more I found reason to like him, the more I set all the strength of mind to
suppress it, or at lest to conceal it. Indeed I must confess, that as some
Physicians have Dorus? whose eyes (being his diligent intelligencers) could
carry unto him no other Priamus while he plaide Paris. Philoclea) what a
Priamus we had: but truly, my Paris was a Paris, and more the^ a Paris: who
while in a savage apparel, with naked neck, arms, and legs, he made love to
Oenone, you might well see by his changed countenance, and true tears, that
he felt the part he playde. Tell me (sweet Philoclea,) did you ever see
such a shephearde? tell me, did you ever hear of such a Prince? And then tell
me, if a small or unworthy assault have conquered me. Truly I would hate my
life, if I thought vanity led me. But since my parents deal so cruelly with
me, it is time for me to trust something to my own judgment. Yet hitherto
have my Mopsa, that I should read

MOst blessed paper, which shall kiss that hand, where to all blessedness is in
nature a servant, do not yet disdain to carry with thee the woeful words of a
miser now Dorus, but his end? End then, evil destinied Dorus, end; and end
thou woeful letter, end; for it suffices her wisdom to know, that her
heavenly will shall be accomplished.

O my Philoclea, is he a person to write these words? and are these words
truly the fear of him ever since has put me into such perplexity, as now
you found me. Ah my Pamela (said Philoclea) leave sorrow. The river of your
tears will soon loose his fountain; it is in your hand as well to stich up
his life again, as it was before to rent it. And so (though with selfe-grieued
mind) she comforted her Pamelaes fair weeping eyes.

Which when Philoclea found, wringing her hands, O me (said she) indeed the
only subject of the destinies displeasure, whose greatest fortunatenes is more
unfortunate, then my sisters greatest vnfortunatenesse. Alas she weeps
because she would be no sooner happy; I weep because I can never be happy;
her tears flow Pamela, I do not envy thee: only I could wish that being thy
sister in nature, I were not so far off a kin in fortune.

But the darkness of sorrow ouershadowing her mind, as the night did her
eyes, they were both content to hide themselves under the wings of sleep, till
the next Miso; who having been with Gynecia, had received commandment to be
continually with her daughters, and particularly not to let Zelmane and
Philoclea have any private conference, but that she should Miso having now her
authority increased, But ca^e with skowling eyes to deliver a slauering good
morrow to the two Ladies, telling them, it was a shame for them to mar their
complexions, yea and conditions to, with long lying a bed: and that, when
she was of their age, she trowed, she would have made a handkerchiefe by
that time a day. The two sweet Princes Pamela was ready (and sooner she was
then her sister) the agony of Dorus giving a fit to her self, which the words
of his letter (lively imprinted in her mind) still remembered her of, she
called to Mopsa, and willed her to fetch Dorus to speak with her: Dametas to
grant her in marriage unto him. Mopsa (as glad as of sweet-meate to go of such
an arrant) quickly returned with Dorus to Pamela, who intended both by speaking
with him to give some comfort to his passionate heart, and withal to hear
some part of his life past; which although fame had already delivered
Musidorus (whom she was half ashamed she did love so well, and more then
half sorry she could love no better) but thought best first to make her talk
arise of Pyrocles, and his virtuous father:

Dorus (said she) you told me the last day, that Plangus was deceived in that
he affirmed the Prince Musidorus was drowned: but withal, you confessed his
cosen Pyrocles perished; of whom certainly in that age there was a great loss,
since (as I have heard) he was a young Prince, of whom all men expected as
much, as man's power Dorus) no expectation in others, nor hope in himself could
aspire to a higher mark, then to be thought worthy to be praised by your
judgment, and made worthy to be praised by your mouth. But most sure it is,
that as his fame could by no means get so sweet and noble an air to fly in,
as in your breath, so could not you (leaving your self aside) find in the
world a fitter subject of commendation; as noble, as a long succession of
royal ancestors, famous, and famous for victories could make him: of shape
most lovely, and yet of mind Pyrocles, excellent Pyrocles, what can my words
but wrong thy perfections, which I would to God in some small measure thou
had bequeathed to him that ever must have thy virtues in admiration; that
masked at least in them, I might have found some more gracious acceptance?
with that he imprisoned his look for a while upon Mopsa, who thereuppon fell
into a very wide smiling. Truly (said Pamela) Dorus I like well your mind,
that can raise it self out of so base a fortune, as yours is, to think of the
imitating so excellent a Prince, as Pyrocles was. Who shootes at the midde day
Sun, though he be sure he shall never hit the mark; yet as sure he is, he
shall shoot higher, then who aims but at a bushe. But I pray you Dorus
Euarchus father to Pyrocles, of whom so much fame goes, for his rightly royal
virtues, or by what ways he got that opinion. And then so descend to the
causes of his sending first away from him, and then to him for that excellent
son of his, with the discourse of his life and loss: and therein you may (if
Musidorus his cosen, because, they going together, the story of Pyrocles
(which I only desire) may be the better understood.

Incomparable Lady (said he) your commandment does not only give me the
will, but the power to obey you, such influence has your excellency. And
first, for that famous King Euarchus, he was (at this time you speak off) King
of Macedon, Greece, that even the particular kings therein did acknowledge
(with more or less degrees of homage) some kind of fealty thereunto: as
among the rest, even this now most noble (and by you ennobled) kingdom of
Arcadia. But he, when he came to his crown, finding by his latter ancestors
either negligence, or misfortune, Musidorus took on such shepheardish apparel
for the love of the worlds paragon, as I now wear.

This King left Orphan both of father and mother, (whose father and grandfather
likewise had died young) he found his estate, when he came to the age (which
allowed his authority) so disioynted even in the noblest and strongest lims of
government, that the name of a King was grown even odious to the people, his
authorytie Oligarchie; that is when men are governed in deed by a few, and
yet are not taught to know what those few,

For they having the power of kings, but not the nature of kings, used the
authority as men do their farms, of which they see within a year they shall go
out: making the Kings sword strike whom they hated; the Kings purse reward
whom they loved: and (which is worst of all) making the Royal countenance
serve to undermine

In this, and a much worse plight then it is fit to trouble your excellent
ears withal, did the King Euarchus find his estate, when he took upon him
the regiment: love in his people, and engraffed singular confidence. For how
could they choose but love him, whom they found so truly to love them? He even
in reason disdayning, that they that have charge of beasts, should love their
charge, and care for them; and that he that was to govern the most excellent
creature, should not love so noble a charge. And therefore, where most Princes
(seduced by flattery to

He had only one sister, a Lady (lest I should too easily fall to partial
praises of her) of whom it may be justly said, that she was no unfit branch to
the noble stock whereof she was come. Her he had given in marriage to Dorilaus,
Prince of Thessalia, not so much to make a friendship, as to confirm the
friendship between their posterity, Dorilaus, could need no amplifiers mouth
for the highest point of praise. Who has not heard (said Pamela) of the
valiant, wise, and just Dorilaus, whose unripe death does yet (so many years
since) draw tears from virtuous eyes? And indeed, my father is wont to speak
of nothing with greater admiration, then of Dorilaus (said he) having married
his sister, had his marriage in short time blessed (for so are folk wont to
say, how unhappy soever the children after grow) with a son, whom they named
Musidorus: of whom I must needs first speak Pyrocles; because as he was borne
first, so upon his occasion grew (as I may say accidentally) the others birth.
For scarcely was Musidorus made partaker of this oft-blinding light, when there
were found numbers of Southsayers, who affirmed strange and incredible things
should be performed by that child; whether the heavens at that time listed to
play with ignorant mankind, or that flattery Phrygia (who
ouer-superstitiously thought himself touched in the matter) sought by force to
destroy the infant, to prevent his after-expectations: because were a work of
the superior powers, the heavens at length are never children. But so he did,
and by the aid of the Kings of Lydia and Crete (ioining together their armies)
invaded Thessalia, and brought Dorilaus to some behind-hand of fortune, when
his faithful friend and brother Euarchus came so mightily to his succor, that
Euarchus made a cross marriage also with Dorilaus his sister, and shortly left
her with child of the famous Pyrocles, driven to return to the defense of his
own country, which in his absence (helped with some of the ill contented
nobility) the mighty King of Thrace, and his brother, King of Pannonia,
Dorilaus (valiantly requiting his friends help) in a great battle deprived
of life, his obsequies being no more solemnised by the tears of his partakers,
then the blood of his enemies; with so pearcing a sorrow to the constant heart
of Euarchus, Musidorus, that all men might see prognosticated in Pyrocles, both
Heavens and Earth giving tokens of the coming forth of an Heroical virtue.
The senate house of the planets was Pyrocles, so unworthiness must be the
death of Musidorus.

But the mother of Pyrocles (shortly after her childe-birth) dying, was cause
that Euarchus recommended the care of his only son to his sister; doing it
the rather because the war continued in cruel heat, betwixt him and those
evil neighbors of his. In which mean time those young Princes (the only
comforters of that virtuous widow) grew on so, that Pyrocles taught admiration
to the hardest conceats: Musidorus (perchance because among his subjects)
exceedingly beloved: and Euarchus (well performed by his sister) they were so
brought up, that all the sparks of virtue, which nature had kindled in them,
were so blown to give forth their uttermost heat that justly it may be
affirmed, they enflamed the affections of all that knew them. For almost before
they could perfectly speak, they began to receive conceits not unworthy of the
best speakers: excellent devises

Among which nothing I so much delight to recount, as the memorable friendship
that grew betwixt the two Princes, such as made them more like then the
likeness of all other virtues, and made them more near one to the other, then
the neerenes of their blood could aspire unto; which I think grew the faster,
and the faster was tied between them, by reason that Musidorus being elder by
three or four years, it was neither so great a difference in age as did take
away the delight Pyrocles bare reverence full of love to Musidorus, and
Musidorus had a delight full of love in Pyrocles. Musidorus, what he had
learned either for body or mind, would teach it to Pyrocles; and Pyrocles was
so glad to learn of none, as of Musidorus: Pyrocles, being come to sixtene
years of age, he seemed so to ouerrun his age in growth, strength, and all
things following it, that not Musidorus, no nor any man living (I think) could
perform any action, either on horse, or foot, more strongly, or deliver that
strength more nimbly, or become the delivery more gracefully, or employ all
more virtuously. Which may well seem wonderful: but

At which time understanding that the King Euarchus, after so many years
war, and the conquest of all Pannonia, and almost Thrace, had now brought the
conclusion of all to the siege of Bizantium (to the raising of which siege
great forces were made) they would needs fall to the practice of those virtues,
which they before Musidorus nobly yielding over her own affects to her
childrens good (for a mother she was in effect to them both) the rather that
they might help her beloved brother, they brake off all delays; which
Musidorus for his part thought already had devoured too much of his good time,
but that he had once granted a boon (before he knew what it was) to his
Pyrocles; that he would never seek the adventures of arms, until he might go
with him: which having fast bound his heart (a true slave to faith) he had bid a
tedious delay of following his own humor for his friends sake, till now being
both sent for by Euarchus, and finding Pyrocles able every way to go through
with that kind of life, he was as desirous for his sake, as for his own, to
enter into it. So Euarchus, they recommended themselves to the Sea, leaving the
shore of Thessalia full of tears and vows; and were received thereon with so
smooth and smiling a face, as if Neptune had as then learned falsely to fawn
on Princes. The wind was like a servant, the seeming insensible Loadstone,
with a secret beauty (holding the spirit of iron in it) can draw that
hard-harted thing unto it, and (like a virtuous mistress) not only make it
bow it self, but with it make it aspire to so high a Love, as of the heavenly
Poles; and thereby to bring forth the noblest deeds, that the children of

But by that the next morning began a little to make a guilden show of a good
Thessalia; other recovered Bizantium, and served Euarchus in his war. But in
the ship wherein the Princes were (now left as much alone as proud Lords be
when fortune fails them) though they employed all industry to save
themselves, yet what they did was rather for duty to nature, then hope to
escape. So ougly a d^rkenesse, as if it might be done (putting their hands to
every most painful office) taught them at one instant to promise themselves
the best, and yet to despise the worst. But so were they carried by the
tyranny of the wind, and the treason of the sea, all that night, which the
elder it was, the more wayward it showed it self toward them: till the next
morning (known to be a morning better by the houre-glasse,

But the Princes using the passions of fearing evil, and desiring to escape,
only to serve the rule of virtue, not to abandon ones self, lept to a ribbe of
the ship, which broken from his fellows, floted with more likelihood to do
service, then any other limme of that ruinous body; upon which there had
gotten already two brethren, well known servants of theirs; and straight they
four were carried out of Leucippus, the younger Nelsus) showed themselves
right faithful and grateful servants unto them; grateful (I say) for this
cause: Those two gentlemen had been taken prisoners in the great war the
Phrygia made upon Thessalia, in the time of Musidorus his infancy; and having
been sold into another country (though peace fell after between these
Realms) could not be delivered, because of their valor known, but for a far
greater sum, then either all their friends were able, or the Dowager willing
to make, in respect of the great expenses her self and people had been put to
in those

But now of all the royal Navy they lately had, they had left but one little
piece of one ship, whereon they kept themselves in all truth, having
enterchanged their cares, while either cared for other, each comforting and
councelling how to labor for the better, and to abide the worse. But so fell
it out, that as they were carried by Musidorus seeing (as he thought) Pyrocles
not well upon the board, as he would with his right hand have helped him on
better, he had no sooner vnfastned his hold, but that a wave forcibly spoiled
his weaker hand of hold; and so for a time parted those friends, each crying to
the other, but the noise of the sea drowned their farewell. Pyrocles (then
careless of death, if it had come by any means, but his own) was shortly
brought out of the seas fury to the lands comfort; when (in my conscience I
know) that comfort was but bitter unto him. And bitter indeed it fell out even
in it self to be unto him.

For being cast on land much bruised and beaten both with the Seas hard
farewell,

This country whereon he fell was Phrygia, and it was to the King thereof to
whom he was sent, a Prince of a melancholy constitution both of body and
mind; wickedly sad, ever musing of horrible matters; suspecting, or rather
condemning Sycophantes, of all men did best sort to his nature; but therefore
not seeming Sycophantes, because of no evil they said, they could bring any
new or doubtful thing unto him, but such as already he had been apt to
determine; so as they came but as proofs of his wisdom: fearful and never
secure; while the fear Musidorus destenie came to his ears (delivered unto
him, and received of him with the hardest interpretation, as though his
subjects did delight in the hearing thereof.) Then gave he himself indeed to
the full current of his disposition, especially after the war of Thessalia,
wherein (though in truth wrongly) he deemed, his vnsuccesse proceeded of their
unwillingness to have him prosper: and then thinking himself contemned,
(knowing no countermine against contempt, but terror) began to let nothing
pass which might bear the color of a fault, without sharp punishment:
Pyrocles to the stormy mind of that Tyrant, all men that did such wrong to so
rare a stranger (whose

But when this bloody King knew what he was, and in what order he and his cousin
Musidorus (so much of him feared) were come out of Thessalia, assuredly
thinking (because ever thinking the worst) that those forces were provided
against Musidorus, determined in public sort to put Pyrocles to death. For
having quite lost the way of noblenes, he straue to clime to the height of
terriblenes; and thinking to make all men adread, to make such one an enemy,
who would not spare, nor fear to kill so great a Prince; and lastly, having
nothing in him why to make him his friend, he thought, he would

But so it fell out that his death was prevented by a rare example of
friendship in Musidorus: who being almost drowned, had been taken up by a
Fisherman belonging to the kingdom of Pontus; and being there, and
understanding the full discourse (as Fame was very prodigal of so notable an
accident) in what case Pyrocles Pyrocles, he found means to acquaint him
self with a nobleman of that Country, to whom largely discovering what he
was, he found him a most fit instrument to effectuate his desire. For this
nobleman had been one, who in many wars had served Euarchus, and had been so
mind-striken by the beauty of virtue in that noble King, Musidorus in a strong
Castle of his, and then to make the King of Phrygia understand, that if he
would deliver Pyrocles, Musidorus would willingly put him self into his hands:
knowing well, that how thirsty so ever he was of Pyrocles blood, he would
rather drink that of Musidorus.

The Nobleman was loath to preserve one by the loss of another, but time
urging resolution: the importunity of Musidorus (who showed a mind not to
ouer-liue Pyrocles) with the affection he bare to Euarchus, so prevailed, that
he carried this strange offer of Musidorus, which by that Tyrant was greedelie
accepted.

And so upon security of both sides, they were enterchanged. Where I may not
omit the work of friendship in Pyrocles, who both in speech and
countenance Musidorus, well showed, that he thought himself injured, and not
relieved by him: asking him, what he had ever seen in him, why he could not
bear the extremities of mortal accidents as well as any man? and why he
should envy him the glory of suffering death for his friends cause, and (as
it were) rob him of his own possession? But in this notable contention,
(where the Musidorus prevailed: because he was a more welcome pray to the
unjust King, and as chearefully going toward, as Pyrocles went frowardly
fromward his death, he was delivered to the King, who could not be enough sure
of him, without he fed his own eyes upon one, whom he had begone to fear, as

Yet because he would in one act, both make ostentation of his own felicity
(into whose hands his most feared enemy was fallen) and withal cut of such
hopes from his suspected subjects (when they should know certainly he was
dead) with much more skillful cruelty, and horrible solemnity he caused each
thing to be Pyrocles, this strange encounter he had.

The excelling Pyrocles was no sooner delivered by the kings servants to a
place Musidorus, or to perish with him. And (finding he could get in that
country no forces sufficient by force to rescue him) to bring himself to die
with him, (little hoping of better event) he put himself in poor raiment, and
by the help of some few crowns he took of that nobleman, (who full
Musidorus: a far notabler proof of his friendship, considering the height of
his mind, then any death could be. That bad officer not Pyrocles taking his
time, when Musidorus was upon the scaffold (separa^ed somewhat from the rest,
as allowed to say something) he stepped unto him, and Musidorus (said he) die
nobly. In truth, never man between joy before knowledge what to be glad of,
and fear after considering his case, had such a confusion of thoughts, as I
had, when I saw Pyrocles, so near me. But with that Dorus blushed, and Pamela
smiled: and Dorus the more blushed at her smiling, and she the more smiled at
his blushing; because he had (with the remembrance of that plight he was in)
forgotten in speaking of him self to use the third person. But Musidorus
turned again her thoughts from his cheeks to his tongue in this sort: But
(said he) when they were with swords in hands, not turning backs one to the
other (for there they knew was no place of defense) but making it a
preservation in not hoping to be preserved, and now acknowledging themselves
subject to death, meaning only to do honor to their princely birth, they flew
amongst them all (for all were enemies) and had Pyrocles (the excellent
Pyrocles) did such wonders beyond belief, as was hable to lead Musidorus to
courage, though he had been borne a coward. But indeed, just rage and desperate
virtue did such effects, that the popular sort of the beholders began to be
almost superstitiously amazed, as at effects beyond mortal power.

But as they were still fighting with weak arms, and strong hearts, it
happened, that one of the soldiers (commanded to go up after his fellows
against the Princes) having received a light hurt, more wounded in his heart,
went back with as much diligence, as he came up with modesty: which another
of his fellows seeing, to pike a thank of the King, struck him upon the face,
reuiling him, that so accompanied, Musidorus their chief: choosing one of them
(because Princes) to defend them, and him because elder and most hated of the
Tyrant, and by him to be ruled: whom forthwith they lifted up, Fortune (I
think) smiling at her work

But by and by there came news of more certain truth, that the King was not
dead, but fled to a strong castle of his, near hand, where he was gathering
forces in all speed possible to suppress this mutiny. But now they had run
themselves too far out of breath, to go back again the same career; and too
well they knew Musidorus. Who seeing what forces were in the city, with them
issued against the Tyrant, while they were in this heat; before practices might
be used to disseuer them: and with them met the King, who likewise hoping
little to prevail by time, (knowing and finding his peoples hate) met him with
little delay in the field: where him self was slain by Musidorus, Pyrocles.
This victory obtained, with great, and truly not undeserved honor to the two
Princes, the whole estates of the country with one consent, gave the crown and
all other marks of sovereignty to Musidorus; desiring nothing more, then to
live under such a government,

But he thinking it a greater greatness to give a kingdom, then get a kingdom;
understanding that there was left of the blood Royal, and next to the
succession, an aged Gentleman of approved goodness (who had gotten nothing by
his cousins power, but danger from him, and odiousnes for him) having past his
time in modest

This doing set forth no less his magnificence, then the other act did his
magnanimity: so that greatly praised of all, and justly beloved of the new
King, who in all both words and behavior protested him self their Tenant,
and Pontus; the same country upon which Musidorus also was fallen, but not in
so luckie a place.

For they were brought to the King of that country, a Tyrant also, not through
suspicion, greedines, or reuengefulnes, as he of Phrygia, but (as I may term
it) of a wanton cruelty: inconstant in his choice of friends, or rather never
having a friend,

He chanced at that time (for indeed long time none lasted with him) to have
next in use about him, a man of the most envious disposition, that (I think)
ever infected the air with his breath: whose eyes could not look right upon
any happy no man could win, but by being miserable. And so, because these
two faithful servants of theirs came in miserable sort to that Court, he was
apt enough at first to favor them; and the King understanding of their
adventure, (wherein they had showed so constant a faith unto their Lords)
suddenly falls to take a pride in making much of them, extolling them with
infinite praises, and praising Phrygia destroyed by their two Lords, who
having been Pontus, by this envious Counselor, partly with suspicion of
practice, partly with glory of in-part revenging his cousins death, the King
was suddenly turned, (and every turn with him was a downe-fall) to lock them
up in prison, as servant to his enemies, whom before he had never known, nor
(till that time one of his own subjects had entertained and dealt for them)
did Musidorus and Pyrocles, as if they had done traitorously, and not
heroically in killing his tyrannical Cosen.

But that injury went beyond all degree of reconcilement; so that they making
forces in Phrygia (a kingdom wholly at their commandment, by the love of the
people, and gratefulness of the King) they entered his country; and wholly
conquering it (with such deeds as at lest Fame said were excellent) took the
King; and by Musidorus commandment ( Pyrocles heart more enclining to pity)
he was slain Pyrocles quietly have enjoyed that crown, by all the desire of
that

Among the rest, two brothers of huge both greatness and force, therefore
commonly where one man's force was able to keep down an army. These brothers
had a while served the King of Pontus, and in all his affairs (especially of
war, whereunto they were only apt) they had showed, as unconquered courage, so
a rude faithfulness: being men indeed by nature apter to the faults of rage,
then of deceit; not

It were the part of a very idle Orator to set forth the numbers of
wel-deuised honors done unto them: But as high honor is not only gotten and
borne by pain, and danger, but must be nursed by the like, or else vanishes as
soon as it appears to the world: so the natural hunger thereof (which was in
Pyrocles) suffered Euarchus was passed all the cumber of his wars) go
privately to seek exercises of their virtue; thinking it not so worthy, to be
brought to Heroycall effects by fortune, or necessity, (like Ulysses and
Aeneas) as by ones own choice, and working. And so went they away from very
unwilling people to leave them, making time haste it self to be a circumstance
of their honor, and one place witness to another of the truth of their
doings. For scarcely were they out of the confines of Pontus, but that as they
rid alone armed, (for alone they went, one serving the other) they met an
adventure; which though not so notable for any great effect they performed,
yet worthy to be remembered for the vn-vsed examples therein, as well of true
natural goodness, as of wretched ungratefulness.

It was in the kingdom of Galacia, the season being (as in the depth of
winter) very cold, and as then suddenly grown to so extreme and foul a
storm, that never any winter (I think) brought forth a fowler child: so that
the Princes were even compelled by the hail, that the pride of the wind blew
into their faces, to seek some shrowding place which a certain hollow rock
offering Leonatus (said he) since I cannot persuade thee to lead me to that
which should end

This old man (whom I lead) was lately rightful Prince of this country of
Paphlagonia, by the hard-harted ungratefulness of a son of his, deprived, not
only of his kingdom (whereof no foreign forces were ever able to spoil him)
but of his sight, the riches which Nature graunts to the poorest creatures.
Whereby, and by other his unnatural dealings, he has bin driven to such
grief, as even now he would have had me to have led him to the top of this
rock, thence to cast of you have a father, and feel what duetifull affection
is engraffed in a sons heart, let me entreat you to convey this afflicted
Prince to some place of rest and security. Amongst your worthy acts it shall
be none of the least, that a King, of such might and fame, and so unjustly
oppressed, is in any sort by you relieved.



But those thieves (better natured to my son then my self) spared his life,
letting him go, to learn to live poorly: which he did, giving himself to
be a private soldier, in a country here by. But as he was ready to be
greatly advanced Cittadels, the nestes of tirannie, and murderers of
liberty; disarming all his own countrymen, that no man durst show himself a
well-willer of mine; to say the truth (I think) few of them being so
(considering my cruel folly to my good son, and foolish kindness to my
unkind bastard:) but if there were any who felt a pity of so great a fall,
and had yet any sparks of unslain duty left in them toward me; yet durst
they not show it, scarcely with giving me alms at their doors; which yet
was the only sustenaunce of my distressed life, no body daring to show so
much charity,

The matter in it self lamentable, lamentably expressed by the old Prince
(which needed not take to himself the gestures of pity, since his face could
not put of the marks thereof) greatly moved the two Princes to compassion,
which could Plexirtus (so was the bastard called) came thither with forty
horse, only of purpose to murder this brother; of whose coming he had soon
advertisement, and thought no eyes of sufficient credit in such a matter, but
his own; and therefore came himself to be actor, and spectator. And as soon
as he Leonatus. But the young Prince (though not otherwise armed but with a
sword) how falsely soever he was dealt with by others, would not betray him
self: but bravely drawing it out, made the death of the first that assailed
him, warn his fellows Pyrocles and Musidorus were quickly become parties (so
just a defense deserving as much as old friendship) and so did behave them
among that company (more injurious, then valiant) that many of them lost their
lives for their wicked master.

Yet perhaps had the number of them at last prevailed, if the King of Pontus
(lately presently to follow those two Princes whom he most dearly loved) was
come in all have, following as well as he could their track with a hundredth
horses in that country, which he thought (considering who then reigned) a
fit place enough to make the stage of any Tragedy.

Plexirtus, that his ill-led life, and worse gotten honor should have tumbled
together to destruction; had there not come in Tydeus and Telenor, with forty
or fifty in their suite, to the defense of Plexirtus. These two were brothers,
of the noblest house of that country, brought up from their infancy with
Plexirtus: men of such prowess, as not to know fear in Pyrocles and
Musidorus had never Pontus and Phrigia, they had in few days, left him but
only that one strong place where he was. For fear having been the only knot
that had fastened his people unto him, that once untied by a greater force, they
all scattered from him; like so many birds, whose cage had been broken.

In which season the blind King (having in the chief city of his Realm,
set Leonatus head) with many tears (both of joy and sorrow) setting forth to
the whole people, his own fault and his sons virtue, after he had kissed him,
and forced his son to accept honor of him (as of his new-become subject) even
in a moment died, as it should seem: his heart broken with unkindness and
affliction, stretched so far beyond his limits with this excess of comfort,
as it

But Plexirtus finding, that if nothing else, famine would at last bring him to
destruction, thought better by humblenes to creep, where by pride he could
not march. For certainly so had nature formed him, and the exercise of craft
con^ormed him to all turningnes of of sleights, that though no man had less
goodness in his soul then he, no man could better find the places whence
arguments might grow of goodness to another: though no man felt less pity,
no man could tell better how to stir pity: no man more impudent to deny, where
proofs were not manifest; Plexirtus alive into his hands) to speak with the
King his brother, he him self (though much against the minds of the valiant
brothers, who rather wished to die in brave defense) Leonatus. Where what
submission he used, how cunningly in making greater the fault he made the
faultines the less, how artificially he could set out the torments of his own
conscience, with the burdensome comber he had found of his ambitious desires,
how finely seeming to desire nothing but death, as ashamed to live, he Leonatus
saw him with no other eye, then as the murderer of his father; and anger
already began to paint revenge in many colors, ere long he had not only
gotten pity, but pardon, and if not an excuse of the fault past, yet an
opinion of a future amendment: while the poor villains (chief ministers

In such sort the Princes left these reconciled brothers ( Plexirtus in all his
behavior Leonatus would suffer him) and taking likewise their leaves of their
good friend the King of Pontus (who returned to enjoy their benefit, both of
his wife and kingdom) they privately went thence, having only with them the
two valiant brothers, who would needs accompany them, through diverse places;
they four doing acts Erona of Lycia, besieged by the puissant King of
Armenia, they bent themselves to her succor, both because the weaker (and
weaker as being a Lady,) and partly because they heard the King of Armenia had
in his company three of the most famous men living, for matters of arms, that
were Plangus, (whose name was sweetened by your breath, peerlesse Lady, when
the last day it pleased you to mention him unto me) the other two were two
great Princes (though holding of him) Barzanes and Euardes, men of Giant-like
both hugenes and force: in which two especially, the trust the King had of
victory, was reposed. And of them, those brothers Tydeus and Telenor
(sufficient judges in warlike matters) spoke so high commendations, that the
two Princes had even a youthful longing to have some trial of their virtue.
And therefore as soon as they were entered into Lycia they joined themselves
with the^ that faithfully served the poor Queen, at that time besieged: and
ere long animated in such sort their almost overthrown hearts, that they went
by old friend and master, Plexirtus: who (willingly hood-winking themselves
from seeing his faults, and binding themselves to believe what he said) often
abused the virtue of courage to defend his foul vice of injustice. But now
they were sent for to advance a conquest he was about; while Pyrocles and
Musidorus pursued the Erona.

I have heard (said Pamela) that part of the story of Plangus when he passed
through this country: therefore you may (if you list) pass over that war of
Eronaes quarrel, lest if you speak too much of war matters, you should wake
Mopsa, which might happily breed a great broile. He looked, and saw that Mopsa
indeed Pamela calling aloud Mopsa, she suddenly start up, staggering, Pamela,
why she had called her. For nothing (said Pamela) but that you might hear some
tales of your servants telling and: therefore now (said she Dorus go on.

Philoclea came in, and by and by after her, Miso; so as for that time they
were feign to let Dorus depart. But Pamela (delighted even to preserve in her
memory, the words of so well a beloved speaker) repeated the whole substance to
her sister, till their sober dinner being come and gone, to recreate themselves
something, Misos conversation) they determined to go (while the heat of the
day lasted) to bath themselves (such being the manner of the Arcadian nymphs
often to do) in the river of Ladon, and take with them a Lute, meaning to
delight them under some shadow. But they could not stir, but that Miso with her
daughter Mopsa was after them: and as it lay in their way to pass Zelmane out
of her window espied them, and so stale down after them: which she might the
better do because that Gynecia was sick, and Basilius (that day being his
birthday) according to his manner, was busy about his devotions; and therefore
she went after, hoping to find some time to speak with Philoclea: but not a
word could she begin, but that Miso would be one of the Greece had the
price for excellent pureness and sweetness, in so much as the very bathing
in it, was accounted exceeding healthful. It ran upon so fine and delicate a
ground, as one could not easily judge, whether the River did more wash the
gravel, or the gravel did purify the River; the River not running forth
right, but almost continually winding, as if the lower streams would return
to their spring, or that the River had a delight to play with it self. Cypres,
who bowing her fair head over the water, it seemed she looked into it, and
dressed her green locks, by that running River. There the Princesses
dete^mining to bathe the^selus, though it was so privileged a place, upon pain
of death, as on body durst presume to come thither, yet for the more surety,
they looked round about, and could see nothing but a water spaniell, who came
down the riuer^ sh^wing Zelmane also to wash her self with them, and she
^xcusing her self with having taken a late cold, they began by peece-meale to
take away the eclipsing of their apparel.

Zelmane would have put to her helping hand, but she was taken with such a
quiuering, that she thought it more wisdom to lean herself to a tree and
look Miso and Mopsa (like a couple of foreswat melters) were getting the pure
silver of their bodies out of the ure of their garments. But as the rayments
went of to receive kisses of the ground, Zelmane envied the happiness of all,
but of the smock was even jealous, and when that was taken away too, and that
Phil^clea remained (for her Zelmane only marked) like a Dya^on taken from out
the rock, or Zelmane could not choose but run, to touch, ^mbrace and kiss
her; But conscience made her come to her self, and leave Philoclea, who
blushing, and withal smiling, making shamefastnes^e pleasant, and pleasure
shamefast, Ladon had once fully embraced them, himself was no more

Ah sweet, now sweetest Ladon (said Zelmane) why do thou not s^ay thy course
to have more full taste of thy happiness? But the reason is manifest, the upper
streams make such haste to have their part of embracing, that the nether
(though Ladon, within whom she is, upon whom her beauty falls, through whom her
eye perceth. O happy Ladon, which art now an imperfect mirror of all
perfection, can thou ever forget the blessedness of this impression? if thou
do, then let thy bed be turned from fine grauel, to weeds and mudde; if thou
do, let some unjust niggards make weres to spoil thy beauty; if thou do, let
some greater river fall into thee, to take away the name of Ladon. Oh Ladon,
happy Ladon, rather slide then run by her, lest thou should make her legs
slip from her; and then, O happy Ladon, who would then call thee, but the
most cursed Ladon? But as the Ladies played them in the water, sometimes striking
it with their hands, the water (making lines in his face) seemed to smile at
such beating, and with twenty bubbles, not to be content to have the picture of
their face in large

But Zelmane, whose sight was gaine-said by nothing but the transparent veil
of Ladon, (like a chamber where a great fire is kept, though the fire be at one
stay, yet with the continuance continually has his heat increased) had the
coals of her affection so kindled with wonder, and blown with delight, that
now all her parts Philocleas beauty which did speedily write it in her eyes;
or the sense thereof, which did word by word endite it in her mind, whereto
she (but as an organ) did only lend utterance. The song was to this purpose.

WHat tongue can her perfections tell
In whose each part all pens may dwell?
Her hair fine threeds of finest gould
In curled knots man's thought to hold:

A whiter beauty you may see.
Whiter indeed; more white then snow,
Which on cold winters face does grow.
That does present those even brows,

Like to the Moon when after change
Her horned head abroad does raunge:
And arches be to heavenly lids,
Whose wink each bold attempt forbids.

The matchless pair, even praise does stain.
No lamp, whose light by Art is got,
No Sun, which shines, and sees not,
Can liken them without all peer,

Which only thus unhappy be,
Because themselves they cannot see.
Her cheeks with kindly claret spread.
Aurora like new out of bed,
Or like the fresh Queene-apples side,
Blushing at sight of Phoebus pride.
Her nose, her chinne pure iuorie wears:
No purer then the pretty ears.
So that therein appears some blood,
Like wine and milk that mingled stood.
In whose Incirclets if ye gaze,
Your eyes may tread a Lovers maze.
But with such turns the voice to stray,
No talk untaught can find the way.
The tippe no jewel needs to wear:
The tippe is jewel of the ear.
But who those ruddie lips can miss?
Which blessed still themselves do kiss.
Rubies, Cherries, and Roses new,
In worth, in taste, in perfect hew:
Which never part but that they show
Of precious pearl the double row,
The second sweetly-fenced ward,
Her heau'nly-dewed tongue to guard.
Whence never word in vain did flow.
Fair under these does stately grow,
The handle of this precious work,
The neck, in which strange graces lurk.
Such be I think the sumptuous towers
Which skill does make in Princes bowers.
So good a say inuites the eye,
A little downward to epsy,
The lively clusters of her breasts,
Of Venus babe the wanton nests:
Like pomels round of Marble clear:
Where azurde veins well mixed appear.
With dearest tops of porphyrie.
Betwixt these two a way does lie,
Away more worthy beauties fame,
Then that which bears the Milkie name.
This leads into the joyous field,
Which only still does Lillies yield:
But Lillies such who^e native smell
The Indian odours does excel.
Waste it is calde, for it does waste
Men's lives, until it be imbraste.
There may one see, and yet not see
Her ribs in white all armed be.
More white then Neptunes fomie face,
When struggling rocks he would embrace.
In those delights the wandering thought
Might of each side astray be brought,
But that her nauel does unite,

A dainty seal of virgin-waxe,
Where nothing but impression lackes.
Her belly then glad sight does fill,
Justly entitled Cupids hill.

A spotless mine of Alablaster.
Like Alablaster fair and sleeke,
But soft and supple satin like.
In that sweet seat the Boy does sport:

"For such a use the world has gotten,
"The best things still must be forgotten.
Yet never shall my song omit
Her thighs, for Ouids song more fit;

Lift up their stately swelling banks;
That Albion cliues in whitenes pass:
With hanches smooth as looking glass.
But bow all knees, now of her knees

The knottes of joy, the gemmes of love,
Whose motion makes all graces move.
Whose bought incau'd does yield such sight,

The gartring place with child-like sign,
Shows easy print in metal fine.
But then again the flesh does rise
In her brave calves, like crystal skies.
Atlas is a smallest small,
More white then whitest bone of all.
Thereout steals out that round clean foot
This noble Cedars precious root:
In show and sent pale violets,
Whose step on earth all beauty sets.
Muse,
Where Ledas swanne his feathers mewes,
Along whose ridge such bones are met,
Like comfits round in marchpane set.
Her shoulders be like two white Doves,

Which leaded are with silver skin,
Passing the hate-spott Ermelin.
And thence those arms derived are;
The Phoenix wings are not so rare
For faultlesse length, and stainelesse hew,
Ah woe is me, my woes renew;
Now course does lead me to her hand,
Of my first love the fatal band.
Where whitenes does for ever sit:
Nature her self enameld it.
For there with strange compact does lie
Warm snow, moist pearl, soft iuorie.
There fall those Saphir-coloured brooks,
Which conduit-like with curious crookes,
Sweet Islands make in that sweet land.
As for the fingers of the hand,
The bloody shaftes of Cupids war,
With amatists they headed are.
Thus has each part his beauties part,
But how the Graces do impart
To all her limbs a special grace,
Becoming every time and place.
Which does even beauty beautify,
And most bewitch the wretched eye.
How all this is but a fair Inn
Of fairer guests, which dwell within.
Of whose high praise, and praisefull bliss,
Goodness the pen, heaven paper is.
The ink immortal fame does lend:
As I began, so must I end.
No tongue can her perfections tell,
In whose each part all tongues may dwell.
But as Zelmane was coming to the latter end of her song, she might see the
same water-spaniell which before had hunted, come and fetch away one of
Philocleas gloves; whose fine proportion, showed well what a dainty guest was
wont there to be lodged. It was a delight to Zelmane, to see that the dog was
therewith delighted, Miso and Mopsa being preparing sheets against their
coming out) the dog lighted upon a little book of four or five leaves of
paper, and was bearing that away too. But then Zelmane (not knowing what
importance Zelmanes eyes straight willed her mind to mark him: for she
thought, in her life she had never seen a man of a more goodly presence, in
make. But when she had a while (not without admiration) vewed him, she desired
him to deliver back the glove and paper, because they were the Lady
Philocleas; telling him withal, that she would not willingly let them know of
his close lying in in that prohibited place, while they were bathing
themselves; because she knew Philocleas, give me leave to keep it, since my
heart cannot persuade it self Zelmane, madded with finding an unlooked for
Rival, and that he would make her a messenger) dispatch (said she) and deliver
it, or by the life of her that owes it, I will make thy soul (though too base a
price) pay for it. And with that drew Amazon-like) she ever ware about her. The
Gentleman retired himself into an open place from among the bushes; and then
drawing out his too, he offered to deliver it unto her, saying withal, God
forbid I should use my sword against you, since (if I be not deceived) you are
the same famous Amazon, that both defended my Ladies just title of beauty
against the valiant Phalantus, and saved her Zelmane: so that again with
ragefull eyes she bad him defend himself, for no less then his life should
answer it. A hard case (said he) to teach my sword that lesson, which has
ever used to turn it self to a shield in a Ladies presence. But Zelmane
Zelmane, who (more spited with that courtesy, that one that did nothing should
be able to resist her) burned away with choler any motions, Zelmane seeming to
Zelmane retiring her sword, and seeing his blood, victorious anger was
conquered by the before-conquered pity; and heartily sorry, and even ashamed
with her self she was, considering how little he had done, who well she found
could have done more. In so much that she said, truly I am sorry for your hurt,
but your self gave the cause, both in refusing to deliver the glove, and yet
not fighting as I know you could have done. But (said she) because I
perceive you disdain to fight with a woman, it may be before a year come
about, you shall meet with a near kinsman of mine, Pyrocles Prince of
Macedon, and I give you Amphialus) I had many more such hurtes to meet and
know that worthy Prince, whose virtue I love and admire, though my good destiny
has not been to see his person.

But as they were so speaking, the young Ladies came, to whom Mopsa curious in
Zelmane fighting, had cried, what she had seen, while they were drying
themselves, and the water (with some drops) seemed to weep, that it should
part from such bodies. But they careful of Zelmane (assuring themselves that
any Arcadian would bear reverence to them) Pamela with a noble mind, and
Philoclea with a loving (hastily hiding Zelmane. But already they found them in
talk, and Zelmane careful of his wound. But when they saw him they knew it
was their cousin germain, the famous Amphialus; whom yet with a sweete-graced
bitterness they blamed for breaking their fathers commandment, especially
while themselves Philoclea (that was even jealous of her self for Zelmane)
would needs have her glove, and not without so mighty a loure as that face
could yield. As for Zelmane when she knew, it was Amphialus, Lord Amphialus
(said she) I have long desired to know you, heretofore I must confess with
more good will, but still with Amphialus answered in honorable sort, but with
such excusing himself, that more and more accused his love to Philoclea, and
provoked more hate in Zelmane. But Mopsa had already called certain Amphialus,
whose wound suffered him not without danger to strain it: and so he leaving
himself with them, departed from them, faster bleeding in his heart, then at
his wound: which bound up by the sheets, wherewith Philoclea had been wrapped,
made him thank the wound, and bless the sword for

He being gone, the Ladies (with merry anger talking, in what naked simplicity
their cousin had seen them) returned to the lodge-warde: yet thinking it too
early (as long as they had any day) to break off so pleasing a company, with
going to perform a cumbersome obedience, Zelmane invited them to the little
arbor, only Pamela having a while made the lute in his language, show how glad
it was to be touched by her fingers, Zelmane delivered up the paper, which
Amphialus had at first yielded unto her: and seeing written upon the backside
of it, the complaint of Plangus, remembering what Dorus had told her, and
desiring to know how much Philoclea knew of her estate, she took occasion in
the presenting of it, to ask whether it were any secret, or no. No Philoclea)
it is but even an exercise of my fathers writing, upon this occasion: He was
one day somwhile before your coming hither) walking abroad, having us two
with him, almost a mile hence; and crossing a hie way, which comes from the
city of Megalopolis, he saw this Gentleman, whose name is there written, one
of the proprest and best-graced men that ever I saw, being of middle Zelmane
willingly opened the leaves, and read it, being written Dialogue-wise in this
manner.

Plangus. Basilius. Plangus. ALas how long this pilgrimage does last?
What greater ills have now the heavens in store,
To couple coming harms with sorrows past?

With cries to skies, and curses to the ground,
But more I plain, I feel my woes the more.
Ah where was first that cruel cunning found,
To frame of Earth a vessel of the mind,

What needed so high sprites such mansions blind?
Or wrapped in flesh what do they here obtain,
But glorious name of wretched humaine-kind?
Balls to the stars, and thralles to Fortunes reign;

Where death is feared, and life is held with pain.
Like players pla'st to fill a filthy stage,
Where change of thoughts one fool to other shows,
And all but jests, save only sorrows rage,

With cries first borne, the presage of his life,
Where wit but serves, to have true taste of woes.
A Shop of shame, a Book where blots be rife
This body is: this body so composed,

So diverse be the Elements disposed
In this weak work, that it can never be
Made uniform to any state reposed.
Grief only makes his wretched state to see
(Even like a top which naught but whipping moves)
This man, this talking beast, this walking tree.
Grief is the stone which finest judgment proves:
For who grieves not has but a blockish brain,
Since cause of grief no cause from life remoues.

Basilius. How long will thou with monefull music stain
The cheerful notes these pleasant places yield,
Where all good haps a perfect state maintain?

Plangus. Cursed be good haps, and cursed be they that build
Their hopes on haps, and do not make despair
For all these certain blows the surest shield.
Shall I that saw Eronaes shining hair
Torn with her hands, and those same hands of snow
With loss of purest blood themselves to tear?
Shall I that saw those breasts, where beauties flow,
Swelling with sighs, made pale with minds disease,
And saw those eyes (those Sons) such shoures to show,
Shall I, whose ears her mournful words did seize,
Her words in syrup laid of sweetest breath,
Relent those thoughts, which then did so displease?
No, no: Despair my daily lesson says,
And says, although I seek my life to fly,
Plangus must live to see Eronaes death,
Plangus must live some help for her to try
(Though in despair) for Love so forces me;
Plangus does live, and shall Erona dye?
Erona dye? O heaven (if heaven there be)
Has all thy whirling course so small effect?
Serve all thy starrie eyes this shame to see?
Let doltes in haste some altars fair erect
To those high powers, which idly sit above,
And virtue do in greatest need neglect.

Basilius. O man, take heed, how thou the Gods do move
To causefull wrath, which thou can not resist.
Blasphemous words the speaker vain do prove.
Alas while we are wrapped in foggie mist
Of our self-love (so passions do deceive)
We think they hurt, when most they do assist.
To harm us worms should that high Justice leave
His nature? nay, himself? for so it is.
What glory from our loss can he receive?
But still our dazeled eyes their way do miss,
While that we do at his sweet scourge repine,
The kindly way to beat us on to bliss.
If she must dye, then has she past the line
Of loathsome days, whose loss how can thou moan,

But such we are with inward tempest blown
Of winds quite contrary in waves of will:
We moan that lost, which had we did bemone.

Plangus. And shall she dye? shall cruel fire spill
Those beams that set so many hearts on fire?
Has she not force even death with love to kill?
Nay even cold Death enflamde with hot desire
Her to enjoy, where joy it self is thrall,
Will spoil the earth of his most rich attire.

And hopes with foul embracements her to get,
In whose decay Virtues fair shrine must fall.
O Virtue weak, shall death his triumph set

Let Death first dye; be thou his worthy let.
By what eclipse shall that Son be defaste?
What mine has erst thrown down so fair a tower?
What sacrilege has such a saint disgra'st?

That sweetens all the place; she is the guest
Of rarest price, both heaven and earth her bower.
And shall (o me) all this in ashes rest?
Alas, if you a Phoenix new will have

But well you know, the gentle Sun would save
Such beams so like his own, which might have might
In him, the thoughts of Phaetons damme to grave.
Therefore, alas, you use vile Vulcans spite,

Which while it is, it is all Asias light.
O Mars, for what does serve thy armed axe?
To let that wit-old beast consume in flames
Thy Venus child, whose beauty Venus lackes?
Venus (if her praise no envy frames,
In thy high mind) get her thy husbands grace.
"Sweet speaking often a currish heart reclaimes.
O eyes of mine, where once she saw her face,
Her face which was more lively in my heart;

O hand, which touched her hand when we did part;
O lips, that kissed that hand with my tears sprent;
O toonge, then dumb, not daring tell my smart;
O soul whose love in her is only spent,
What ere you see, think, touch, kiss, speak, or love,
Let all for her, and unto her be bent.

Basilius. Thy wailing words do much my spirits move,
They vttred are in such a feeling fashion,
That sorrows work against my will I prove.
Me-thinkes I am partaker of thy passion,
And in thy case do glass mine own debilitie:
Selfe-guiltie folk most prone to feel compassion.
Yet Reason says, Reason should have ability,
To hold these wordly things in such proportion,
As let them come or go with even facility.
But our Desires tyrannical extortion
Does force us there to set our chief delightfulnes,
Where but a baiting place is all our portion.
But still, although we fail of perfect rightfulnes,
Seek we to tame these childish superfluities:
Let us not wink though void of purest sightfulnes.
For what can breed more peevish incongruities,
Then man to yield to female lamentations?
Let us some grammar learn of more congruities.

Plangus. If through mine ears pearce any consolation
By wise discourse, sweet tunes, or Poets fiction;
If ought I cease these hideous exclamations,
While that my soul, she, she lives in affliction;
Then let my life long time on earth maintained be,
To wretched me, the last worst malediction.
Can I, that know her sacred parts, restrained be
From any joy? know fortunes vile displacing her,
In moral rules let raging woes contained be?
Can I forget, when they in prison placing her,
With swelling heart in spite and due disdainfulnes
She lay for dead, till I helped with vnlasing her?
Can I forget, from how much mourning plainfulnes
With Diamond in window-glasse she graued,
Erona dye, and end this ougly painefulnes?
Can I forget in how strange phrase she craved
That quickly they would her burn, drown, or smother,
As if by death she only might be saved?
Then let me eke forget one hand from other:
Let me forget that Plangus I am called:
Let me forget I am son to my mother,
But if my memory must thus be thralled
To that strange stroke which conquered all my senses,
Can thoughts still thinking so rest unappalled?

Basilius. Who still does seek against him self offenses,
What pardon can avail? or who imployes him

Woe to poor man: each outward thing annoyes him
In diverse kinds; yet as he were not filled,
He heaps in outward grief, that most destroys him.
Thus is our thought with pain for thistles tilled:

Thus is our mind with too much minding spilled.
One day lays up stuff of grief for the morrow:
And whose good haps do leave him unprovided,
Condoling cause of friendship he will borrow.

We pity deem that which but weakness is:
So are we from our high creation slided.
But Plangus lest I may your sickness miss
Or rubbing hurt the sore, I here do end.


When Zelmane had read it over, marueyling very much of the speech of Eronas
death, and therefore desirous to know further of it, but more desirous to hear
Philoclea speak, Most excellent Lady (said she) one may be little the wiser
for reading Plangus is, nor what Erona is, nor what the cause should be which
threatens her with death, and him with sorrow: therefore I would humbly crave
to understand the particular discourse thereof: because (I must confess) some
thing in my travail I have heard of this strange matter, which I would be glad
to find by so sweet an authority confirmed. The truth is Philoclea) that
after he knew my father to be Prince of this country, while he hoped to
prevail something with him in a great request he made unto him, he was
content to open fully the estate both of himself, and of that Lady; which
with my sisters help (said she) who remembers it better then I, I will declare
unto you: and first of Erona, (being the chief Subject of this discourse) this
story Lydia, who had for the blessing of his marriage, this only daughter of
his, Erona; a Princess worthy for her beauty, as much praise, as beauty may
be prayse-worthy. This princess Erona, being 19. years of age, seeing the
country of Lydia so much devoted to Cupid, as that in every place his naked
pictures Lydians impute it) quickly after appeared.

Antiphilus: so mean, as that he was but the son of her Nurse, and by that
means (without other desert) became known of her. Now so evil could she
conceal her fire, and so wilfully perseuered she in it, that her father
offering her the marriage of the great Tiridates, king of Armenia (who desired
her more then the joys of heaven) she for Antiphilus sake refused it. Many
ways her father sought to with draw her from it; sometimes persuasions,
sometimes threatenings; once hiding Antiphilus, and giving Antiphilus, whom he
kept in prison. But nether she liked persuasions, nor feared threateninges, nor
changed for absence: and when she thought him dead, she sought all means (as
well by poison as knife) to send her soul, at least, to be married in the
eternal church with him. This so Erona (being seized of the crown, and arming
her will with authority) sought to advance her affection to the holy title of
matrimony.

But before she could accomplish all the solemnities, she was overtaken with a
war the King Tiridates made upon her, only for her person; toward whom (for
her Artaxia (who would accompany Erona in her best city, vowing to win her,
or lose his life. And now had he brought her to the point either of a woeful
consent, or a ruinous denial; when there came thither (following the course
which Virtue and Fortune led them) two excellent young Princes, Pyrocles and
Musidorus, the one Prince of Macedon, the other of Thessalia: Plangus said,
(and he witnessed his saying with sighs and tears) the most accomplished both
in body and mind, that the Sun ever looked upon. While Philoclea spoke those
words, O sweet words (thought Zelmane to herself) which are not only a
praise to me, but a praise to praise it self, which out of that mouth
issues.

These 2. princes (said Philoclea) as well to help the weaker (especially being
a Lady) as ta save a Greek people from being ruined by such, whom we call and
count Barbarous, gathering to gether such of the honestest Lycians, as would
venture their lives to succor their Princess: giving order by a secret
message they sent into the City, that they should issue with all force at an
appointed time; they set upon Tiridates Plangus (being General of Tiridates
hors-men) especially aided by the two mighty men, Euardes and Barzanes,
rescued the footme^, even almost defeated: but yet could not bar the Princes
(with their succoures both of men and victual) to enter the City.

Which when Tiridates found would make the war long, (which length seemed to
him worse then a languishing consumption) he made a challenge of three Princes
in his retinue, against those two Princes and Antiphilus: and that thereupon
the quarrel should be decided; with compact, that neither side should help
his fellow: but of whose side the more overcame, with him the victory should
remain. Antiphilus Erona chose rather to bide the brunt of war, then venture
him, yet) could not for shame refuse the offer, especially since the two
strangers that had no interest in it, did willingly accept it: besides that, he
saw it like enough, that the people (werie of the miseries of war) would
rather give him up, if they saw him shrink, then for his sake venture their
ruin: considering that the challengers were far of greater worthiness then
himself. So it was agreed upon; and against Pyrocles Euardes, King of
Bithinia; Barzanes of Hircania, against Musidorus, two men, that thought the
world scarce able to resist them: and against Antiphilus he placed this same
Plangus, being his own cousin germain, and son to the King of Iberia. Now so
it fell out that Musidorus slew Barzanes, and Pyrocles Euardes; which victory
those Princes esteemed above all that ever they had: but of the other side
Plangus Antiphilus prisoner: under which color (as if the matter had been
equal, though indeed it was not, the greater part being overcome of his side)
Tiridates continued his war: and to bring Erona to a compelled yielding, sent
her word, that he would the third morrow after, before the walls of the town
strike off Antiphilus head; without his suite in that space were granted:
adding withal (because he Antiphilus.

Then lo if Cupid be a God, or that the tyranny of our own thoughts seem as a
God unto us. But whatsoever it was, then it did set forth the miserablenes of
his effects: she being drawn to two co^traries by one cause. For the love of
him commanded Antiphilus, o Erona? and shall Tiridates enjoy thy body? with
what eyes will thou look upon Antiphilus, when he Antiphilus then if he were
dead. But thus much more, that the affection shall be still gnawing, and the
remorse still present. Death perhaps will cool the rage of thy affection:
where thus, thou shall ever love, and ever lack. Tiridates, Antiphilus is so
excellent a man, that long he cannot be from being in some high place married:
can thou suffer that too? If an other kill him, he does him the wrong: if
thou abuse thy body, thou do him the wrong. His death is a work of nature,
and either now, or at another time he shall die. But it shall be thy work, thy
shameful work, which is in thy power to shun, to Erona, and is thy Love of
Antiphilus come to that point, as thou do now make it a question, whether he
shall die, or no? O excellent affection, which for too much love, will see his
head off. Mark well the reasons of the other side, and thou Tiridates: this is
but love of thy self: thou shall be ashamed to look upon him afterward; this
is but fear of shame, and love of thy self: thou shall want him as much then;
this is but love of thy self? he shall be married; if he be well, why should
that grieve thee, but for love of thy self? No, no, pronounce these words if
thou can, Antiphilus die. Then the images of each side stood before her
understanding; one time she thought she saw Antiphilus dying: an other time she
thought Antiphilus saw her by Tiridates enjoyed: twenty times calling for a
servant to carry message of yielding, but before he came the mind was
altered. She blushed when she considered the effect of granting; she was pale,
when she remembered the fruits of denying. For weeping, sighing, wringing her
hands, and tearing her hair, were indifferent of both sides. Easily she would
have agreed to have broken all disputations with her own death, but that the
fear of Antiphilus further torments Antiphilus; who with all the coniuring
terms he could devise, besought her to save his life, upon any conditions. But
she had no sooner sent her messenger to Tiridates, but her mind changed, and
she went to the two young Princes, Pyrocles and Musidorus, and Antiphilus, nor
yet to yield to Tiridates.

They that knew not what she had done in private, prepared that night
accordingly: and as sometimes it falls out, that what is inconstancy, seems
cunning; so did this change indeed stand in as good steed as a witty
dissimulation. For it made the Antiphilus, having no armor, nor weapon, but
affection. And I cannot tell you how, by what devise (though Plangus at large
described it) the conclusion was, the wonderful valor of the two Princes so
prevailed, that Antiphilus was succored, Plangus was then the chief man left
in the camp; and therefore seeing no other remedy, conveyed in safety into
her country Artaxia, now Queen of Armenia; who with true lamentations, made
known to the world, that her new greatness did no way comfort her in respect of
her brothers loss, whom she studied all means possible to revenge upon every
one of the occasioners, Pyrocles and Musidorus. But thus was Antiphilus
redeemed, and (though against the consent of all her nobility) married to
Erona; in which case the two Greek Princes (being

But now me thinks as I have read some Poets, who when they intend to tell
some horrible matter, they bid men shun the hearing of it: so if I do not
desire you to stop your ears from me, yet may I well desire a breathing time,
before I am to tell the execrable treason of Antiphilus, that brought her to
this misery; and withal Plangus, I pray you sister (said she) help me with
the rest, for I have held the stage long enough; and if it please you to make
his fortune known, as I Eronas, I will after take heart again to go on with
his falsehood; and so between us both, my Lady Zelmane shall understand both
the cause and parties of this Lamentation. Nay I beshrow me then (said Miso) I
will none of that, I promise you, as long as I have the government, I will first
have my tale, and then my Lady Pamela, my Lady Zelmane, and my daughter Mopsa
(for Mopsa was then returned from Amphialus) The Ladies laughed to see with
what an eger earnestness she looked, having threatening not only in her Ferret
eyes, but while she spoke, her nose seeming to threaten her chin, and her
shaking lims one to threaten another. But there was no remedy, they must obey:
and Miso (sitting on the ground with her knees up, and her hands upon Dametas.
But let that pass, God amend Cupid: here is Cupid, and there is Cupid. I will
tell you now, what a good old woman told me, what an old wise man told her,
what a great learned clerk told him, and gave it him in writing; and here I
have it in my prayer book. I pray you (said Philoclea) let us see it, and read
it. No have but good (said Miso) you shall first know how Miso; O the fine thin
lips of Miso; O the goodly fat hands of Miso: besides, how well a certain
wrying I had of my neck, became me. Then the one would wincke with one eye,
and the other cast daiseys at me: I must confess, seeing Candia, which we pay
so dear for now adays, and in that good world was very good cheap) she called
me to her; Minion said she, (indeed I was a pretty one in those days though I
say it) I see a number of lads that love you; Well (said she) I say no more:
do you know what Venus? for a few days before, our (priest between him and
me) had told me the whole story of Venus. Tush (said she) they are all
deceived: and therewith gave me this Book, which she said a great maker of
ballets had given to an old painter, who for a little pleasure, had bestowed
both book and picture of her. Read there (said she) and thou shall see that
his mother was a cow, and the false Argus his father. And so she gave me this
Book, and there now you may read it. With that the remembrance of the good
old woman, made her make such a face to weep, as if it were not sorrow, it was
the carcass of sorrow that appeared there. But while her tears came out, like
rain falling upon durtie furrows, the latter end of her prayer book was read
among these Ladies, which contained this.

Poor Painters often with silly Poets join,
To fill the world with strange but vain conceits:
One brings the stuff, the other stamps the coin,
Which breeds naught else but gloses of deceits.
Thus Painters Cupid paint, thus Poets do
A naked God, blind young, with arrows two.
Is he a God, that ever flies the light?
Or naked he, disguised in all untruth?
If he be blind, how hitteth he so right?
How is he young, that tamed old Phoebus youth?
But arrows two, and tipped with gold or lead?
Some hurt accuse a third with horny head.
No, nothing so; an old false knave he is
By Argus got on Io, then a cow:
What time for her Juno her Jove did miss,
And charge of her to Argus did allow.
Mercury killed his false sire for this act,
His damme a beast was pardoned beastly fact.
With fathers death, and mothers guilty shame,
With Jove's disdain at such a riuals seed,
The wretch compelled a runnagate became,
And learned what ill a miser state does breed,
To lie, to steal, to pry, and to accuse,
Naught in himself each other to abuse.
Yet bears he still his parents stately gifts,
A horned head, cloven feet, and thousand eyes,
Some gazing still, some winking wilye shifts,
With long large ears where never rumor dies.
His horned head does seem the heaven to spite:
His cloven foot does never tread aright.
Thus half a man, with man he daily haunts,
Clothed in the shape which soonest may deceive:
Thus half a beast, each beastly vice he plants,
In those weak hearts that his advice receive.
He proules each place still in new colors decked,
Sucking ones ill, another to infect.
To narrow breasts he comes all wrapped in gain:
To swelling hearts he shines in honors fire:
To open eyes all beauties he does rain;
Creeping to each with flattering of desire.
But for that Love is worst which rules the eyes,
Thereon his name, there his chief triumph lies.
Millions of years this old driuell Cupid lives;
While still more wretch, more wicked he does prove:
Till now at length that Jove him office gives,
(At Iunos suite who much did Argus love)
In this our world a hangman for to be,
Of all those fools that will have all they see.
The Ladies made sport at the description and story of Cupid. But Zelmane
could scarce suffer those blasphemies (as she took them) to be read, but
humbly besought Pamela she would perform her sisters request of the other
part of the story. Noble Lady (answered she, beautifying her face with a
sweet smiling, and the Zelmane) excellent Princess my tongue of some value,
if it can procure your tongue thus much to favor me. But Pamela pleasantly
persisting to have fortune their judge, they set hands, and Mopsa (though at
the first for squeamishnes going up and down, with her head like a boat in a
storm) put to her golden gols among them, and blind Fortune (that saw not the
coulor of them) and so the Knight casting up his eyes to the window, did fall
into such love with her, that he grew not worth the bread he eat; till many a
sorry day going over his head, with Daily Diligence And so in May, when all
true hearts rejoice, they stale out of the Castle, without staying so much as
for their breakfast. Now forsooth, as they went together, often all to kissing
one another, the Knight told her, he was brought up among the water Nymphs,
who had so bewitched him, that if he were ever asked his name, he must And so a
great while she kept his commandment; til once, passing through a cruel
wilderness, as dark as pitch; her mouth so watered, that she could not choose
but ask him the question. And then, he making the greeuousest complaints that
would have melted a tree to have heard And so she went, and she went, and never
rested the evening, where she went in the morning; till she came to a second
Aunt; and she gave her another Nut.

Now good Mopsa (said the sweet Philoclea) I pray thee at my request keep
this tale, till my marriage day, and I promise thee that the best gown I wear
that day shall be thine. Mopsa was very glad of the bargain, especially that it
should grow a festival Tale: so that Zelmane, who desired to find the
uttermost what these Ladies understood touching her self, and having
understood the danger of Erona (of Plangus, as of Erona. Philoclea referred it
to her sisters perfecter remembrance, who with so sweet a voice, and so winning
a grace, as in themselves were of most forcible eloquence to procure attention,
in

The father of this Prince Plangus as yet lives, and is King of Iberia: a man
(if the judgment of Plangus may be accepted) of no wicked nature, nor
willingly doing evil, without himself mistake the evil, seeing it disguised
under some form of goodness. This Prince, being married at the first to a
Princess (who both from Plangus. Not long after whose birth, the Queen (as
though she had performed the message for which she was sent into the world)
returned again unto her maker. The King (sealing up all thoughts of love under
the image of her memory) remained a widdower many years after; recompencing
the grief of that disioyning from Plangus. Who being grown to man's age, as
our own eyes may judge, could not but fertilly requite his fathers fatherly
education.

This Prince (while yet the errors in his nature were excused by the greenenes
of his youth, which took all the fault upon it self) loved a private man's
wife of the conceit of her he wrested him, as much as he could possibly, to
the other side: not sticking with prodigal protestations to set forth her
chastity; not denying his own attempt, but thereby the more extolling her
virtue. His Sophistry prevailed, his father believed; and so believed, that
ere long (though he were already stepped into Plangus was away, the old man
(growing only in age and affection) followed his suite with all means of
dishonest servants, large promises, and each thing else that might help to
counteruaile his own vnlouelines.

Plangus, or at lest not hoping of him to obtain so aspiring a purpose, left
no art unused, which might keep the line from breaking, whereat the fish was
already taken; not drawing him violently, but letting him play himself upon the
hook, which he had so greedily swalowed. For, accompanying her mourning
garments with a doleful Plangus told it) she could not only sigh when she
Plangus returned from being notably victorious of the Rebels, he Plangus (as he
had every way just cause) was grieved at; yet did his grief never bring forth
either contemning of her, or repining at his father. But she (who besides she
was grown a mother, and a stepmother, did read in his eyes her own fault, and
made his conscience her guiltines) thought still that his of the fault, but of
the repulse, she did not only (as hating him) thirst for a revenge, but (as
fearing harm form him) endeavored to do harm unto him. Therefore did she try
the uttermost of her wicked wit, how to overthrow him in the foundation of his
strength, which was, in the favor of his father: which because she saw strong
both in nature and desert, it required the more cunning how to undermine it.
And

Then took she help to her of a servant near about her husband, who^ she knew
to be of a hasty ambition, and such a one, who wanting true sufficiency to
raise him, would make a ladder of any mischief. Him she uses to deal more
plainly in alleging causes of jealousy, making him know the fittest times
when her (he said) Plangus loved none of them that were great about his father.
Lastly, breaking with him directly (making a sorrowful countenance, and an
humble gesture bear false witness for his true meaning) that he found, not
only soldiery, but people weary of his government, and all their affections
bent upon Plangus. Both Plangus actions began to be translated into the
language of suspicion.

Which though Pl^ngus found, yet could he not avoid, even contraries being
driven to draw one yoke of argument: if he were magnificent, he spent much with
an Proteus, every form should have been made hideous.

But so it fell out, that a mere trifle gave them occasion of further
proceeding.

She underhand dealt with the principal men of that country, that at the
great Plangus, his associate in government with him: assuring them, that not
only she would join with them, but that the father himfelfe would take it
kindly; charging them not to acquaint Plangus withal; for that perhaps it
might be harmefull unto him, if the King should find, that he were a party.
They (who thought they might do it, not only willingly, because they loved
him, and truly, because such indeed was the mind of the people, but safely
because she who ruled the King was agreed thereto) accomplished her counsel:
she indeed keeping promise of vehement persuading the same: which the more she
and they did, the more she knew her husband would Plangus found this, and
humbly protested against such desire, or will to accept. But the more he
protested, the more his father thought he dissembled, accounting his integrity
to be but a cunning face of falsehood: and therefore delaying the desire of his
subjects, attended some fit occasion to lay hands upon his son: which his
wife thus brought to pass.

Plangus, and (enabling his words with great show of faith, and endearing them
with desire of secrecy) to tell him, that he found his ruin conspired by his
stepmother, with certain of the noble men of that country, the King himself
giving his consent, and that few days should pass before the putting it in
practice: with all discovering the very truth indeed, Plangus his own
opinion, made him give him the better credit: yet not so far, as to fly out of
his country (according to the naughty fellows persuasion) but to attend, and
to see further. Whereupon the fellow (by the direction of his mistress) told
him one day, that the same night about one of the clock, the King had
appointed to have his wife, and those noble men together, to deliberate of
their manner of proceeding against Plangus: and therefore offered him, that if
himself would agree, he would bring him into a place where he should hear
all that passed; and so have the more Plangus (being subject to that only
disadvantage of honest hearts, credulity) was persuaded by him: and arming
himself (because of his late going) was closely conveyed into the place
appointed. In the mean time his stepmother, making al her gestures cu^ningly
counterfeit a miserable affliction, she lay almost groueling on the flower of
her chamber, Plangus (soliciting her in the old affection between them) had
besought her to put her helping hand to the death of the King; assuring her,
that though all the laws in the world were against it, he would marry her
when he were King.

She had not fully said thus much, with many pitiful digressio^s, when in
comes Pla^gus: and running himself out of breath, fell at the Kings feet,
beseeching him to save himself; for that there was a man with a sword drawn in
the next room. The King affrighted, went out, and called his guard, who entering
the place, found indeed Plangus with his sword in his hand, but not naked, but
standing suspiciously enough, to one already suspicious. The King (thinking he
had put up

But the day had no sooner opened the eyes and ears of his friends and
followers, but that there was a little army of them, who came, and by force
delivered him; although numbers on the other side (abused with the fine framing
of their report) took arms Plangus, though he might have used the force of his
friends to revenge his wrong, and get the crown; yet the natural love of his
father, and hate to make their suspicion seem just, caused him rather to
choose a voluntary exile, then to make his fathers death the purchase of his
life: and therefore went he to Tiridates, whose mother was his fathers sister,
living in his Court eleven or twelve Erona happened, which my sister with the
cause thereof discoursed unto you.

But his father had so deeply engraued the suspicion in his heart, that he
thought his flight rather to proceed of a fearful guiltines, then of an
humble faithfulness; and Tiridates, and afterward his niece Artaxia, because
in their Court he received countenance, leaving no means unattempted of
destroying his son; among other, employing that wicked servant of his, who
undertook to empoyson him. But his cunning disguised him not so well, but that
the watchful servants of Plangus did have told you.

Which confession autentically set down (though Tiridates with solemn
Embassage sent it to the King) wrought no effect. For the King having put the
reins of the government into his wives hand, never did so much as read it;
but sent it Plangus, for the death of their servant. And now finding, that his
absence, and their reports had much diminished the wavering peoples affection
toward Plangus, with aduauncing fit persons for faction, and granting great
immunities to the commons, they prevailed so far; as to cause the son of
the second wife, called Palladius, Plangus quite excluded: so that Plangus was
driven to continue his serving Tiridates, as he did in the war against
Erona, and brought home Artaxia, as my sister told you; when Erona by the
treason of Antiphilus, But at that word she stopped. For Basilius (not able
longer to abide their absence) came suddenly among them, and with smiling
countenance (telling Zelmane Zelmane meaning some other time to understand the
story of Antiphilus treason, and Eronas danger, whose cause she greatly
tendered. But Miso had no sooner espied Basilius, but that as spitefully, as her
rotten voice could utter it, Amphialus. But Basilius only attended what
Zelmanes opinion was, who though she hated Amphialus, yet the nobility of her
courage prevailed over it, and she desired he might be pardoned that youthful
error; considering the reputation he had, to be one of the best knights in the
world; so as hereafter he governed himself, as one remembering his fault.
Basilius giving the infinite Zelmanes both valor in conquering, and
pittifulnesse in pardoning, commanded no more words to be made of it, since
such he thought was her pleasure.

So brought he them up to visit his wife, where between her, and him, the
poor Zelmane received a tedious entertainment; oppressed with being loved,
almost as Basilius not so wise in covering his passion, could make his tongue go
almost no other pace, but to run into those immoderate praises, which the
foolish Lover thinks short of his Mistres, though they reach far beyond the
heavens. But Gynecia (whom womanly modesty did more outwardly bridle) yet did
oftentimes use the advantage of her sex in kissing Zelmane, as she sat upon
her Zelmane could not stir, but that, (as if they had been poppets, whose
motion stood only upon her pleasure) Basilius with serviceable steps,
Gynecia with greedy eyes would follow her. Basilius mind Gynecia well knew,
and could have found in her heart to laugh at, if mirth could have Gynecias
actions were interpreted by Basilius, as proceeding from jealousy of his
amorousnesse. Zelmane betwixt both (like the poor child, whose father while
he beats him, will make him believe it is for love; or like the sick man, to
whom the Physician swears, the ill-tasting wallowish medicine he profers, is
of a good taste) their love was hateful, their courtesy Dorus, what ods is
there between thy destiny and mine? For thou have to do in thy pursuit but
with shepherdish folks, who trouble thee with a little envious care, and
affected diligence. But I (besides that I have now Miso the worst of thy
devils, let loose upon me) am waited on by Princes, and watched by the two
wakefull eyes of Love and Jealousy. Alas, incomparable Philoclea, thou ever
see me, but do never see me as I am: thou hear willingly all that I dare
say, and I dare not say that which were most fit

But the night coming on with her silent steps upon them, they parted each
from other (if at lest they could be parted, of whom every one did live in
another) and went about to flatter sleep with their beds, that disdained to
bestow it self liberally Gynecia. who (when Basilius after long tossing was
gotten a sleep, and the cheereful comfort of the lights removed her) kneeling
up in her bed, began with a soft voice, and swollen heart, to renew the curses of
her birth; and then in a manner embracing her bed; Ah chastest bed of mine (said
she) which never heretofore could Basilius (awaked with the noise) took her
in his arms, and began to comfort her; the good man thinking, it was all for a
jealous love of him: which humor if she would a little have maintained,
perchance it might have weakened his new conceived fancies. Zelmane, who baited
on this fashion by these two lovers, and ever kept for many mean to declare
herself, found in her self a daily increase

The chief recreation she could find in her anguish, was sometime to visit
that place, where first she was so happy as to see the cause of her unhap.
There would she kiss the ground, and thank the trees, bliss the aier, and
do dutiful reverence to every Basilius himself gave her good occasion to go
beyond them. For having combd Zelmane was, he found her given over to her
musical muses, to the great pleasure of the good old Basilius, who retired
himself behind a tree, while she with a most sweet voice did utter these
passionate verses.

Loved I am, and yet complain of Love:
As loving not, accused in Love I die.
When pity most I crave, I cruel prove:
Still seeking Love, love found as much I fly.
Burnt in my self, I muse at others fire:
What I call wrong, I do the same, and more:

I wail for want, and yet am chokt with store.
This is thy work, thou God for ever blind:
Though thousands old, a Boy entit'led still.
Thus children do the silly birds they find,

Yet thus much Love, O Love, I crave of thee:
Let me be loved, or else not loved be.
Basilius made no great haste from behind the tree, till he perceived she had
fully Danae is painted, when she suddenly saw the golden shoure, O heavenly
woman, or earthly Goddess (said he) let not my presence be odious unto you,
nor my humble suite seem of small weight in your ears. Vouchsafe Zelmane
(keeping a countenance ascanses she understood him not) told Basilius, proud
that that was brought in question) what may they Zelmane lifting up her face as
if she had received a mortal injury of him. And is this the devotion your
ceremonies have been bent unto? said she: Is it the disdain of my estate, or
the opinion of my lightness, that have emboldned such base fancies toward
Basilius was so appalled, that his legs bowed under him; his eyes looked as
though he would gladly hide himself; and his old blood going to his heart, a
general shaking all over his body possessed him. At length with a wanne
mouth; he was about to give a stammering answer, when it came into Zelmanes
Philocleas mouth, as from one

Basilius (whose senses by Desire were held open, and conceit was by Love
quickened) heard scarcely half her answer out, but that (as if speedy flight
might save his life) he turned away, and ran with all the speed his body
would suffer him, toward his daughter Philoclea: whom he found at that time
duetifully watching by her mother, and Miso curiously watching her; having
left Mopsa to do the like service to Pamela. Basilius forthwith calling
Philoclea aside, (with all the Zelmane; all the powers of his spirit depending
of her: that if she continued cruel, he could no more sustain his life, then
the earth remain fruitful in the Suns continual absence. He concluded,
she should in one payment requite all his deserts: and that she needed not
disdain any service (though never so mean) which was warranted by Philoclea
more glad then ever she had known her self, that she might by this occasion,
enjoy the private conference of Zelmane, yet had so sweet a feeling of virtue
in her mind, that she would not suffer a vile color to be cast over her fair
thoughts; but with humble grace answered her father: That there needed neither
promise nor persuasion to her, to make her do her uttermost Zelmanes favor,
she would in all virtuous sort seek it toward him: and that as she would not
pearce further into his meaning, then himself should declare, so would she
interpret all his doings to be accomplished in goodness: and therefore desired,
(if otherwise it were) that he would not impart it to her, who then should be
forced to begin (by true obedience) a show Basilius content to take that,
since he could have no more (thinking it a great point, if by her means, he
could get but a more free access unto Zelmane) allowed her reasons, and took
her proffer thankfully, desiring only a speedy Philoclea was parting, and Miso
straight behind her, like Alecto following Proserpina. But Basilius forced her
to stay, though with much a do, she being sharp-set upon the fulfilling of a
shrewde office, in ouer-looking Philoclea: and so said to Basilius, that she
did as she was commanded, and could not answer it to Gynecia, if she were any
whit from Philoclea: telling him true, that he did evil to Basilius, (swearing
he would put out her eyes, if she stird a foot to trouble his daughter) gave
her a stop for that while.

So away departed Philoclea, with a new field of fancies for her trauayling
mind. For well she saw, her father was grown her adverse party, and yet her
fortune such, as she must favor her Rival; and the fortune of that fortune
such, as neither

But she walked but a little on, before she saw Zelmane lying upon a bank, with
her face so bent over Ladon, that (her tears falling into the water) one might
have thought, that she began meltingly to be metamorphosed to the vnder-running
river. But by and by, with speech she made known, as well that she lived, as
that procure your stay a while with me, that I may begin yet at last, to
find some thing that pities me: and that all things of comfort and pleasure
do not fly away from me. But if the violence of your spring command you to
haste away, to pay your duties to your great prince, the Sea, yet carry with
you these few words,


(Mine eyes even great in labor with their tears)
I laid my face; my face wherein there lies
Clusters of clouds, which no Sun ever cleares.
In watery glass my watrie eyes I see:

My thoughts imprisonde in my secret woes,
With flamie breathes do issue often in sound:
The sound to this strange aier no sooner goes,
Echoes force rebound.
And make me hear the plaints I would refrain:
Thus outward helps my inward grief maintain.
Now in this sand I would discharge my mind,

But in the sand my tales foretold I find,
And see therein how well the writer fares.
Since stream, aier, sand, mine eyes and ears conspire:

And as soon she had written them (a new swarm of thoughts stinging her mind)
she was ready with her foot to give the newborn letters both death and
burial. But Philoclea (whose delight of hearing and seeing was before a stay
from Zelmane, that neither she could look on, nor would look off. At last
Philoclea (having a little mused how to cut the threede even, between her own
hopeless affection, and her fathers unbridled hope) with eyes, cheeks, and
lips, (whereof each sang their part, to make up the harmony of bashfulnesse)
began to say, My Father to whom I owe my self, and therefore, When Zelmane
(making a womanish Philoclea, and taking it again by the sweetness of those
kisses) humbly besought her to keep her speech for a while within the Paradise
of her mind. For well she knew her fathers errand, who should soon receive a
sufficient answer. But now she demanded leave not to loose this long
sought-for commodity of time, to Philocleas mouth, at lest Philoclea might
know, whom she had condemned. Philoclea easily yielded to grant her own
desire: and so making the green bank the situation, and the river the
prospect of the most beautiful buildings of Nature, Zelmane doubting how to
begin, though her thoughts already had run to the end, with a mind
fearing the unworthiness of every word that should be presented to her ears,
at length brought it forth in this manner.

Most beloved Lady, the incomparable excellencies of your self, (waited-on by

But alas, whether go thou my tongue? or how does my heart consent to
adventure the revealing his nearest touching secret? But peace Fear, thou
come too late, when already the harm is taken. Therefore I say again, O
only Princess, attend here a miserable miracle of affection. Behold here
before your Pyrocles, Prince of Macedon, whom you only have brought to this
game of Fortune, and unused Metamorphosis: whom you only have made neglect
his country, forget his Father, and lastly, forsake to be Pyrocles: the same
Pyrocles, who (you heard) was betrayed by being put in a ship, which being
burned, Pyrocles was drowned. O most true presage: for these traitors, my eyes,
putting me into

The joy which wrought into Pygmalions mind, while he found his beloved image
was softer, and warmer in his folded arms, till at length it accomplished his
Zelmanes words creepingly entered into Philoclea: till her pleasure was fully
made up with the manifesting of his being; which was such as in hope did
overcome Hope. Yet Doubt would feign have played his part in her mind, and
called in question, how she should be assured that Zelmane was Pyrocles. But Love
straight stood up and deposed, that a lie could not come Zelmane^ Besides, a
certain spark of honor, which rose in her well-disposed mind, made her
fear to be alone with him, with whom alone she desired to be (with all the
other contradictions growing in those minds, which neither absolutely clime the
rock of Virtue, nor freely sink into the sea of Vanity) but that spark
soon gave place, or at lest gave no more light in her mind, then a Zelmane?
Alas your words be against it. Shall I say Prince Pyrocles? wretch that I am,
your show is manifest against it. But this, this I may well say; If I had
continued Philoclea, you had either never been, or ever been Zelmane: you had
either never attempted this change, set on with hope, or never discovered it,
stopped with despair. But I fear me, my behavior ill governed, gave you the
first comfort: I fear me, my affection ill hid, has given you this last
assurance: I fear indeed, the weakness of my government before, made you
think such a mask Zelmane (for so I love to call thee, since in that name
Pyrocles? how may that well be, since when thou were Zelmane, the despair thou
might not be thus, did most torment

Then held she her tongue, and cast down a self-accusing look, finding, that
in her self she had (as it were) shot out of the bow of her affection, a more
quick opening of her mind, then she minded to have done. But Pyrocles so
carried up Euarchus, unto him, which even in the Sea had amongst his jewels been
preserved. But little needed those proofs to one, who would have fallen out
with herself, rather then make any contrary conjectures to Zelmane speeches;
so that with such imbracements, as it seemed their souls desired to meet, and
their hearts to kiss, as their mouths did: which feign Pyrocles would have
sealed with the chief arms of his desire, but Philoclea commanded the
contrary; and yet they passed the promise of marriage.

And then at Philocleas entreaty, who was willing to purloine all occasions of
remaining with Zelmane, she told her the story of her life, from the time of
their departing from Erona, for the rest she had already understood of her
sister. For (said she) I have understood, how you first in the company of
your Noble cousin Musidorus Thessalia, and of diverse adventures, which with no
more danger then glory you passed through, till your coming to the succor of
the Queen Erona; and the end of that war (you might perceive by my self) I
had understood of the Prince Plangus. But what since was the course of your
doings, until you came, after so many victories, to make a conquest of poor
me, that I Pyrocles (for what can mine ears be so sweetly fed with as to hear
you of you) be liberal unto me of those things which have made you indeed
precious to the world, and now doubt not to tell of your perils; for since I
have you here out of them, even the remembrance of them is pleasant. Pyrocles
easily perceived she was content with kindness, to put off occasion of further
kindness; wherein Love showed himself a cowardly boy, that durst not attempt
for fear of offending. But rather Love proved himself valiant, that durst
with the sword of reverent duty gaine-stand the force of so many enraged
desires. But so it was, that though he knew this discourse was Pyrocles, only
therefore of value, because he is your Pyrocles? And therefore grow I now so
proud, as to think it worth the hearing, since you vouchsafe to give it the
hearing. Therefore (only height of my hope) vouchsafe to know, that after the
death of Tiridates, and settling Erona in her government; for settled we
Antiphilus, that so great a beauty as Eronas (indeed excellent) could not have
held his affection? so great goodness could not have bound Erona.

Euardes (the brave and mighty Prince, whom it was my fortune to kill in the
combat for Erona) had three Nephews, sons to a sister of his; all three set
among the foremost rancks of Fame for great minds to attempt, and great force
to perform what they did attempt; especially the eldest, by name Anaxius; to
whom all men would willingly have yielded the height of praise, but that his
nature did rather breed disdain. And if it be true that the Giants ever made
war against heaven, he had been a fit ensigne-bearer for that company. For
nothing seemed hard to him, though impossible; and nothing unjust, while his
liking was his justice. Now he in these wars flatly refused his aid; because he
could not brook, that Plangus was by his cosen Tiridates preferred before him.
For allowing no other weights, but the sword and spear in judging of desert,
how-much he esteemed himself before Plangus in that, so much would he have had
his allowance in his service.

But now that he understood that his uncle was slain by me, I think rather
scorn Lycia; where he would prove upon me, that I had by some treachery
overcome his uncle, whom else many hundreds such as I, could not have withstood.
Amphialus (who for some years has universally borne the name of the best
Knight in the world) had diverse times fought with him, and never been able to
master him; but so had left him, that every man thought Anaxius in that one
virtue of courtesy far short of him, in all other his Anaxius still deeming
himself for his superior. Therefore to him I would go, and I would needs go
alone, because so I understood for certain, he was; and (I must confess)
desirous to do something without the company of the incomparable Prince
Musidorus, because in my heart I acknowledge that I owed more to his presence,
then to any thing in my self, whatsoever before I had done. For of him Erona
to let us depart from her, (as it were) forefeeling the harms which after fell
to her. Anaxius) met an adventure, which (though in it self of small importance)
I will tell you at large, because by the occasion thereof I was brought to as
great comber and danger, as lightly any might escape.

As I past through a Laund (each side whereof was so bordred both with high the
wood of the right hand, made me well assured by the greatness of the cry, it
was the voice of a man, though it were a very vnmanlike voice, so to cry. But
making mine ear my guide, I left not many trees behind me, before I saw at
the bottom of one of them a gentleman bound (with many garters) hand and
foot, so as well he might tomble and toss, but neither run nor resist he
could. Upon

I was moved to compassion, and so much the more that he straight called to me
for succor, desiring me at lest to kill him, to deliver him from those
tormenters. But before my-selfe could resolve, much less any other tell what I
would resolve, there came in choleric have toward me about seven or eight
knights; the foremost

This man called Pamphilus, in birth I must confess is noble (but what is that
to him, if it shall be a stain to his dead ancestors to have left such an
offspring?) in these qualities lies such a poisonous addar as I will tell you.
For by those gifts of Nature and Fortune (being in all places acceptable) he
creepes, nay (to say truly) he flies so into the favor of poor silly women,
that I would be too much ashamed to confess, if I had not revenge in my hand,
as well as shame in my cheeks. For devised how to get him among us alone:
which he (suspecting no such matter of them, whom he had by often abuses he
thought made tame to be still abused) easily gave us opportunity to do.

And a man may see, even in this, how soon Rulers grow proud, and in their
pride foolish: he came with such an authority among us, as if the Planets had
done

Among other of his answers (forsooth) I shall never forget, how he would
prove it was no inconstancy to change from one love to another, but a great
constancy; and contrary, that which we call constancy, to be most
chaungeable. For (said he) I ever loved my delight, and delighted always in
what was Lovely: Dido, (and indeed have met with a false AEneas) to me, I
say, (o the ungrateful villainy) he could find no other fault to

But when he had thus plaide the careless Prince, we (having those servants of
ours in readiness, whom you lately so manfully overcame) laid hold of him;
beginning at first but that trifling revenge, in which you found us busy; but
meaning afterward to have mangled him so, as should have lost his credit for
ever abusing force with entreaty, stayed her fury.

But, while I was persuading her to meekenes, comes a number of his friends, to
whom he forthwith cried, that they should kill that woman, that had thus
betrayed and disgraced him. But then I was feign to forsake the ensign; under
which I had Anaxius, for whom I was feign to stay two days in the appointed
place, he disdaining to wait for me, till he was sure I were there.

Pamphilus, whom I Dido (that Lady, who had most sharply punished him) riding
upon a palfery, he following her with most vnmanlike cruelty; beating her with
wandes he had in his hand, she crying for sense of pain, or hope of succor:
which was so pitiful a sight unto me, that it moved me to require Anaxius
Dido) giving him so great a blow, as somewhat stayed him, to term it a right)
I flatly ran away from him toward my horse, who trotting after the company,
in in mine armor I was put to some pain, but that use made me nimble unto
it. But as I followed my horse, Anaxius followed me: but his proud heart did
so dis (...) (...) times bitterlye warn his daughter of bringing such costlye
mates under his roof: which she grieuing at, desired much to know my name, I
think partlye of kindness to remember who had done something for her, and
partlye because she assured her self I was such a one as would make enen his
miser-minde contented, with what he had done. And accordingly she demanded my
name, and

But the causes of their joys were far different; for as the shepherd and
the butcher both may look upon one sheep with pleasing conceits, but the
shepherd with mind to profit himself by preserving, the butcher with killing
him: So she rejoiced to find that mine own benefits had tied me to be her
friend, who was a Prince of such greatness, and lovingly rejoiced: but his
joy grew, Artaxias setting my head to sale, for having slain her brother
Tiridates; which being the sum of an hundredth thousand crowns (to whosoever
brought me alive into her hands) that old wretch, (who had ouer-liued all good
nature) though he had lying idly by him much more then that, yet above all
things loving money, for Anaxius, he sent in all speed to a Captain of a
Garrison near by; which though it belonged to the King of Iberia, (yet knowing
the Captains humor to delight so in riotous spending Dido) she

And so we went on together: he so old in wickedness, that he could look me in
the face, and freely talk with me, whose life he had already contracted for:
till coming into the falling of a way which led us into a place, of
each-side Artaxia. But they could not have used worse eloquence to have
persuaded my yielding, then that; I knowing the little good will Artaxia bare
me. And therefore making necessity and justice my best sword valor, and
valewing money higher then equity, felt, that guiltlesnesse is not always
with ease oppressed. As for Chremes, he withdrew himself, yet so guilding his
wicked conceits with his hope of gain, that he was content to be a beholder,
how I should be taken to make his pray.

Musidorous came to my succor; who having followed my trace as well as he
could, after he found I had left the fight with Anaxius, came to the niggards
Castle, where he found all burnd and spoiled by the country people, who bare
mortal hatred to that covetous man, and now Musidorus not staying either to
further, or impeache, came upon the spur after me (because with one voice
many told him, that if I were in his company, it was for no good meant unto
me) and in this extremity found me. But when I saw that Cosen of mine, me
thought Musidorus by him? who, what he did there for me, how many he killed,
not stranger for the number then for the strange blows wherewith he sent them
to a wel-deserued death, might well delight me to speak off, but I should so
hold you too long in every particular. But in Musidorus show himself second
to none in able valor.

Yet what the unmeasurable excess of their number would have done in the end
I know not, but the trial thereof was cut off by the chaunceable coming
thither of the King of Iberia, that same father of the worthy Plangus, whom it

Plangus Chremes to be hanged: though truly for my part, I earnestly labored
for his life, because I had eaten of his bread. But one thing was notable for a
conclusion of his miserable life, that neither the death of his daughter, who
(alas poor Gentlewoman was by chance slain among his clownes, while she
ouerboldelye

This justice thus done, and we delivered, the King indeed in royal sort
invited such wounds as we had received, while I, causing diligent search to be
made of Anaxius, could learn thing, but that he was goneno out of the
country, boasting in every place how he had made me run away) we were brought
to receive the favor of acquaintance with this Queen Andromana, whom the
Princess Pamela did in so liuelye colors describe the last day, as still me
thinks the figure thereof possesses

And therefore I shall need the less to make you know what kind of woman she
was; but this only, that first with the raines of affection, and after with
the very use of directing, she had made her self so absolute a master of her
husbands mind, that a while he would not, and after, he could not tell how to
govern

Now we being brought known unto her (the time that we spent in curing some
very dangerous wounds) after once we were acquainted, (and acquainted we were
sooner then our selves expected) she continually almost haunted us, till (and
it was not long a doing) we discovered a most violent bent of affection: and
that so way excellent Lady) you would have wo^dred to have seen, how before us
she would confess the contention in her own mind between that lovely (indeed
most louelye) brou^nes of Musidorus his face, and this color of mine, which
she (in the deceiuable style of affection) would entitle beautiful: how her
eyes wandered like a glutton at a Musidorus, and end the other half to Pyrocles:
not ashamed (seeing the friendship between us) to desire either of us to be a
mediator to the other; as if we should have played one request at Tennis
between us: and often wishing that she might be the angle, where the lines of
our friendship might meet; and be the knot which might

At that Philoclea smiled, with a little nod. But (said Pyrocles) when she
perceived no hope by suite to prevail, then (persuaded by the rage of
affection, and encouraged Phrigia, Pontus and Galatia) seemed not unlikely to
him, who (but skimming any thing that came before him) was disciplined to leave
the through-handling of

But while we were thus full of weariness of what was past, and doubt of what
was to follow, Love (that I think in the course of my life has a spot
sometimes to poison me with roses, sometimes to heal me with wormwood)
brought forth a remedy unto us: which though it helped me out of that distres,
alas the conclusion was such, as I must ever while I live, think it worse then
a wrack, so to have been preserved. This King by this Queen had a son of
tender age, but of great Plangus: whose great deserts now either forgotten, or
ungratefully remembered, all men set their sails with the favorable wind,
which Plangus (who some years before was their only champion) the poor
comfort of calamity, pity. This youth therefore accounted Prince of that
region, by name Palladius, did with vehement affection love a young Lady,
brought up in his fathers court, called Zelmane, daughter to that
mischievously Plexirtus (of whom already I have, and sometimes must make, but
never honorable mention) left there by her father, because of the intricate
changeablenes of his estate; he by the motherside being half brother to this
Queen Andromana, and therefore the willinger committing her to her care. But
as Love (alas) does not always reflect it self, so fell it out that this
Zelmane, Palladius) yet could not ever persuade her heart to yield thereunto:
with that pain to Palladius, as they feel, that feel an vnloued love. Yet
loving indeed, and therefore constant, he used still the intercession of
diligence and faith, ever hoping, because he would not put him self into that
hell, to be hopeless: until the time of our being come, and captiued

Such was therein my ill destiny, that this young Lady Zelmane (like some
unwisely liberal, that more delight to give presents, then pay debtes) she
chose (alas for the pity) rather to bestow her love (so much undeserved, as
not desired) Palladius: who (true Lover) considering what, and not why, in all
her commandments; and indeed she concealing from him her affection (which
she entitled compassion,) immediately obeyed to imploye his uttermost credit
to relieve us: which though has great, as a beloved son with

The time of the marrying that Queen was every year, by the extreme love of
her husband, and the serviceable love of the Courtiers, made notable by some
public honors, which did (as it were) proclaim to the world, how dear she
was to that people. Among other, none was either more grateful to the
beholders, or more noble in it self, then iusts, both with sword and lance,
maintained for a seuen-night together: wherein that Nation does so excel, both
for comelines and hablenes, that

This day it happened that diverse famous Knights came thither from the Court of
Helen, Queen of Corinth, a Lady, whom fame at that time was so desirous to
honor, that she borrowed all men's mouths to join with the sound of her
Arcadia, they are far beyond all conceipte of comparison) so has her
government been such as has been no less beautiful to men's judgments, then
her beauty to the eiesight. For being brought by right of birth, a woman, a
young woman, a fair woman, to govern a Corinth were Diana apparrelled in the
garments of Venus. And this which Fame only delivered unto me, (for yet I have
never seen her) I am the willinger to speak of to Amphialus; and Philoxenus
and search of Amphialus has made Palladius (who himself had never used arms)
persuaded the Queen Andromana to be content him. Which she did not more for
saving him, then keeping us: and yet not satisfied with our oath, appointed a
band of horsemen to have eye, that we should not go beyond appointed limits. We
were willing to gratify the young Prince, who (we saw) loved us. And so the
fourth day of that exercise, we came into the field: where (I remember) the
manner was, that the forenoone they should run at tilt, one after

The first that ran was a brave Knight, whose devise was to come in, all
chayned with a Nymph leading him: his Impresa was

Against him came forth an Iberian, whose manner of entering was, Impresa was a
Sheep marked with pitch, with this word Spotted to be known. And because I
may tell you out his conceit (though that were not done, till the running for
that time was ended) before the Ladies departed from the windows, among whom
there was one (they say) that was the Star, whereby his PHILISIDES went among
them, and sang an eclogue; one of them answering another, while the other
shepherds pulling out recorders (which possessed the place of pipes) accorded
their music to the others voice. The Eclogue had great praise: I only
remember six verses, while having questioned one with the other, of their
fellow-shepheards sudden

ME thought some staves he mist: if so, not much amiss:
For where he most would hit, he ever yet did miss.
Once said he brake a cross; full well it so might be:
For never was there man more crossely crossed then he.
But most cried, O well broke: O fool full gaily blessed:
Where failing is a shame, and breaking is his best.
Thus I have digrest, because his manner liked me well: But when he began to
LElius,, it had near grown (though great love had ever been betwixt them) to
a quarrel. For Philisides breaking his staves with great commendation, Lelius
(who was known to be second to none in the perfection of that art) ran ever
over his head, but so finely to the skillful eyes, that one might well see he
showed more knowledge in missing, then others did in hitting. For with so
gallant a Mars. But Philisides was much moved with it, while he thought Lelius
would show a contempt of his youth: till Lelius (who therefore would satisfy
him, because he was his friend (made him know, that to such bondage he was for
so many courses tied by her, whose disgraces to him were

But so by Lelius willing-missing was the odds of the Iberian side, and
continued so in the next by the excellent running of a Knight, though fostred
so by the Muses, as many times the very rusticke people left both their
delights and profits to harken to his songs, yet could he so well perform all
armed sports, as if he had never Impresa was, a mill-horse still bound to go
in one circle; with this word, Data fata sequutus. But after him the Corinthian
knights absolutely prevailed, especially a great noble man of Corinth, whose
Phoenix: the fire took so artificially, as it consumed the bird, and left him
to rise as it were, out of the ashes thereof. Against whom was the fine frosen
Knight, frosen in despair; but his armor so naturallye representing Ice, and
all his furniture so lively answering thereto, as yet did I never see any thing
that pleased me better.

Corinthians that morning in the exercise (as they had done the days before)
had the better; Palladius neither suffering us, nor himself to take in hand the
party til the after noone; when we were to fight in troops, not differing
otherwise from earnest, but Pall^dius (especially led by Musidorus, and
somewhat aided by me) himself truly behauing him self nothing like a
beginner, brought the honor to rest it self that night on the Iberian side:
and the next day, both morning, and afternoon being kept by our party, He
(that saw the time fit for the delivery he intended, called unto us Zelmane.

Bythinia, not regarding shame, or danger of having entered into another
dominions: but (having with her about a threescore hors-men) straight commanded
to unjust assaulters. And so Musidorus incredible valor (beating down all
lets) made both me, and Palladius, so good way, that we had little to do to
overcome weak wrong.

And now had the victory in effect without blood, when Palladius (heated with
the fight, and angry with his mothers fault) so pursued our assaylers, that
one Andromanas, and hated us for having dispossessed him of her heart) taking him
to be one of us, with a traitorous blow slew his young Prince: who falling
down before our eyes, whom he specially had delivered, judge (sweetest Lady)
whether anger might not be called justice in such a case: once, so it wrought
in us, that many of his subjects

All this while disdain, strengthened by the fury of a furious love, made
Andromana stay to the last of the combat: and when she saw us light down, to
see what help we might do to the helpless Palladius, she came running madly
unto us, then no less threatening, when she had no more power to hurt. But when
she perceived it Musidorus labored obout Palladius. But the wound was past the
cure of a better surgeon then my self, so as I Iberia. With that Philoclea,
seeing the tears stand in his eyes with remembrance of Palladius, but much
more of that which thereupon grew, she would needs drink a kiss from those
eyes, and he suck another from her lips; whereat she blushed, and yet kissed
him again to hide her blushing, Which Pyrocles into another discourse, but that
she with so sweet a rigor forbad him, that he durst not rebel, though he
found it a great war to keep that peace, but was feign to go on in his
story: for so she absolutely bad him, and he durst not know how to disobey.

So (said he) parting from that place before the Sun had much abased himself
at times say. Thou do kill me with thy unkind falsehood: and, It greeues me
not to die, but it greeues me that thou art the murderer: neither does mine
own pain so much vex me, as thy error. For God knows, it would not trouble
me to be slain for thee, but much it torments me to be slain by thee. Thou art
untrue, Pamphilus, Pamphilus is false. But alas, the Sun keeps his light,
though thy faith be darckned; the rocks stand still; though thou Leucippe. But
it is no matter, Baccha (thy new mistres) Baccha, let Pamphilus live happy
though I dye.

And much more to such like phrase she spoke, but that I (who had occasion to
know something of that Pamphilus) stepped to comfort her: and though I could not
do that, yet I got thus much knowledge of her, that this being the same
Leucippe, to whom the unconstant Pamphilus had betrothed himself, which had
moved Baccha, of whom she complained; one, that in diverse places I had heard
before blazed, as the most impudently unchaste woman of all Asia; Pamphilus
(for her) left Leucippe, and withal, left his faith: Leucippe, of whom one look
(in a clear judgment) would have been more acceptable, then all her kindnesses
so prodigally bestowed. For my self, the remembrance of his cruel handling
Dido, joined to this, stirred me to seek some revenge Leucippe to a house
thereby, dedicated to Vestall Nuns, where she resolved to spend all her
years (which her youth promised should be many) in bewayling the wrong, and
yet praying for the wrong doer.

Zelmane, Plexirtus daughter; whom vnconsulting affection (unfortunately borne
to me-wardes) had made borrowe so much of her natural modesty, as to
Andromanas tumultuous pursuing us, had apparelled her self like a page, with a
pitiful cruelty cutting of her golden hair, leaving nothing, but the short
curles, to cover that noble head, but that she ware upon it a fair
head-peece, a shield at her back, and a lance in her hand, else disarmed. Her
apparel of white, wrought upon with broken knots, her horse, fair and lusty,
which she rid so, as might show a fearful boldness, daring to do that, which
she knew that she knew not how to do: and the sweetenes of her countenance did
give such a grace to what she did, that it did make hansome Iberia, her name
Daiphantus, who having seen what I had done in that court, had Andromanas
following me, which by her I understood, she hiding nothing (but her sex) from
me. And still me thought I had seen that face, but the great alteration of her
fortune, made her far distant from my memory: but liking very well the young
Gentleman, (such I took her to be) admitted this Daiphantus about me, who well

But in such sort did she serve me in that kingdom of Bythinia, for two months
space. In which time we brought to good end, a cruel war long maintained
between Bythinia and his brother. For my excellent cousin, and I (dividing our
selves to either side) found means (after some trial we had made of our
selves) to get such credit with them, as we brought them to as great peace
between themselves, as love toward us, for having made the peace. Which done,
we intended to return through the Kingdom of Galatia, toward Thrace, to ease
the care of our extreme feebleness, all together set upon them. But common
danger brake off particular discord, so that (though with a dying weakness)
with a lively courage they resisted, and by our help drove away, or slew those
murdering attempters: among whom we hapt to take alive the principal. But
going to disarme those two Tydeus and Telenor; whose adventure (as afterward we
made that ungracious wretch confess) had thus fallen out.

After the noble Prince Leonatus had by his fathers death succeeded in the
kingdom Galatia, he (forgetting all former injuries) had received that
naughty Plexirtus into a straight degree of favor, his goodness being as apt
to be deceived, as the others craft was to deceive. Till by plain proof
finding, that the ungrateful man went about to poison him, yet would not
suffer his kindness to be overcome, not by justice it self: but calling him
to him, used words to this purpose. Plexirtus (said he) this wickedness is
found by thee. No good deeds of mine have been able to keep it down in
thee. All men counsel me to take away thy life, likely to bring forth
nothing, but as dangerous, as wicked effects. But I cannot find it in my
heart, remembering what fathers son thou art. But since it is the violence of
ambition, which perchance pulls thee from thine own judgment, Trebisonde;
which, with the territory about it, aunciently pertained unto this crown, now
unjustly possessed, and as unjustly abused by those, who have neither title to
hold it, nor virtue to rule it. To the conquest of that for thy self I will
lend thee force, and give thee my

Plexirtus, mingling forsworn excuses with false-meant promises, gladly
embraced the offer: and hastily sending back for those two Brothers (who at
that time were with us succouring the gracious Queen Erona) by their virtue
chiefly (if not Plexirtus, considering how much he was bound unto them: while
they likewise (with ^ certain sincere boldness of selfe-warranting
friendship) Plexirtus be thought too much in them, since all they were, was his.

But he (who by the rules of his own mind, could construe no other end of men's
doings, but self seking) suddenly feared what they could do; and as suddenly
suspected, what they would do, and as suddenly hated them, as having both
might, Pontus, never since he succored Leonatus and us, to his overthrow) gave
them to understand that of late there had passed secret defiance between
them, to meet privately at a place appointed. Which though not so fit a thing
for men of their greatness, yet was his honor so engaged, as he could not go
back. Yet faining to find himself weak by some counterfeit infirmity, the
day drawing near, he requested each of them to go in his stead; making either
of the^ swear, to keep the matter secret, even each from other, delivering
Tydeus, the King would meet him in a blew armor; and Telenor, that it was a
black armor: and with wicked subtlety (as if it had been so appointed) caused
Tydeus to take a black armor, and Telenor a blew; appointing them ways how to
go, so as he knew they should not meet, till they came to the place appointed,
where each had promised to keep silence, Plexirtus: and there in a wait had he
laid these murderers, that who ouerliued the other, should by them be
dispatched: he not daring trust more then those, with that enterprise, and yet
thinking them too few, till themselves by themselves were weakened.

This we learned chiefly, by the chief of those way-beaters, after the death
of Bythinia, where we learning thus much (as I have told you) caused the
wicked Historian to conclude his story, with his own well-deserued death.

But then (I must tell you) I found such woeful countenances in Daiphantus,
that I could not but much marvel (finding them co^tinew beyond the first
assault of pity) how the case of strangers (for further I did not conceive)
could so deeply pearce. But the truth indeed is, that partly with the shame
and sorrow she took of her fathers faultiness, partly with the fear, that
the hate I conceived against him,

While we returning again to embarke our selves for Greece, understood that
the mighty Otanes (brother to Barzanes slain by Musidorus, in the battle of
the six Princes) had entered upon the kingdom of Pontus, partly upon the
pretenses he had to the crown, but principally, because he would revenge upon
him (whom he Giants, sons to a couple whom we slew in the same realm: they
having been absent Pontus. We therefore with all speed went thetherward, but by
the way this fell out, which whenever I remember without sorrow, I must
forget withal, all humanity.

Poor Daiphantus fell extreme sick, yet would needs conquer the delicacie of
Pontus, we met one, who in great have went seeking for Tydeus and Telenor,
whose death as yet was not known unto the messenger; who (being their
servant, and knowing how dearly they loved Plexirtus) brought them word, how
since their departing, Plexirtus was in present danger of a cruel death, if
by the valiantness Plexirtus.

Daiphantus, that she fell suddenly into deadly soundings; never coming to
her self, but that withal she returned to make most pitiful lamentations;
most strange unto us, Pyrocles, that your page Daiphantus is the unfortunate
Zelmane, who for your sake caused my (as unfortunate) lover, and cosen,
Palladius, to leave his fathers court, and consequently, both him and my Aunt
his mother, to loose their lives. For your sake my self have become, of a
Princess a Page: and for your sake have put off the apparel of a woman, and
(if you judge not more mercifully) the modesty. We were amazed at her speech,
and Zelmane, who^ before we had known in the court of Iberia. And sorrow and
pity laying her pain upon me, I comforted her the best I could by the
tenderness of good will, pretending indeed better hope then I had of her
recovery.

But she that had inward ambassadors from the tyrant that shortly would
oppress her, No, my dear master (said she) I neither hope nor desire to live.
I know you would never have loved me (and with that word she wept) nor, alas,
had it

But when she saw my tears, O God (said she) how largely am I recompensed for
my losses? why then (said she) I may take boldness to make some requests
Plexirtus, remember Zelmanes father. The second is, that when you come once
into Greece, you will take unto your self this name (though unlucky) of
Daiphantus, and vouchsafe to be called by it: for so shall I be sure, you shall
have cause to remember me: and let it please your noble cousin to be called
Palladius, that I do that right to that poor Prince, that his name yet may
live upon the earth in so excellent a person: as far short of your
perfection, as her self dying, was of her self flourishing: yet something
there was, which (when I saw a picture of yours) brought again her figure into
my remembrance, and made my heart as apt to receive the wound, as the power of
your beauty with irresistable force to pearce.

Musidorus toward the King of Pontus, who stood in no less need then immediate
succor, Otanes, and the two Giants. Now the day was so accorded, as it was
impossible for me both to succor Plexirtus, and be there, where my honor was
not only so far engaged, but (by the strange Musidorus, whom better then my
self I loved, to go save him whom for just causes I hated. But my promise
given, and given to Zelmane, and to Zelmane dying, prevailed more with me, then
my friendship to Musidorus: though certainly I may affirm, nothing had so
great rule in my thoughts, as that. But my promise carried me the easier,
because Musidorus Plexirtus was prisoner to an ancient Lord, absolutely
governing a goodly Castle, with a large territory about it, whereof he
acknowledged no other sovereign, but himself: whose hate to Plexirtus, grew
for a kinsman of his, whom Galatia, he found him apt to practice for the
restoring of his virtuous brother Leonatus. This old Knight, still thirsting
for revenge, used (as the way to it) a policy, which this occasion I will
tell you, prepared for him. Plexirtus in his youth had married Zelmanes mother,
who dying of that only childbirth, he a widdower, and not yet a King, Armenia;
where (as he was cunning to win favor) he obtained great good liking of
Artaxia, which he purs^ed, till (being called home by his father) he falsely got
his fathers kingdom; and then neglected his former love: till thrown out of
that (by our means) before he was deeply rooted in it, and by and by again
placed in Trebisonde, understanding that Artaxia by her brothers Armenia, he
was hotter then ever, in that pursuit, which being understood by this old
Knight, he forged such a letter, as might be written from Artaxia, entreating
his present (but very private) repair thither, giving him faithful promise of
present marriage: a thing far from her thought, having faithfully, and
publicly protested, that she would never marry any, but Rhinoceros, as
strong as an Elephant, as fierce as a Lion, as nimble as a Leopard, and as
cruel as a Tigre: whom he having kept in a strong place, from the first youth
of it, now thought no fitter match, then such a beastly monster with a
monstrous Tyrant: proclaiming yet withal, that if any so well loved him, as to
venture their lives against his beast, for him, if they overcame, he should be
saved: not caring how many they were (such confidence he had in that monsters
Tydeus and Telenor, whom he no less hated, because they had been principal
instruments of the others power.

I dare say, if Zelmane had known what danger I should have passed, she would
rather have let her father perish, then me to have bidden that adventure. But
my Plexirtus should be delivered if I were victorious, I undertook the
combatte: and (to make short, excellent Lady, and not to trouble your ears
with recounting a Asia. And the old nobleman so well liked me, that he loved
me; only bewayling, Pontus, whether I would needs in all speed go, to see
whether it were possible for me (if perchance the day had been delaied) to come
to the combat. But that (before I came) had been thus finished.

The virtuous Leonatus understanding two so good friends of his were to be in
that danger, would perforce be one him self: where he did valiantly, and so
did the King of Pontus. But the truth is, that both they being sore hurt, the
incomparable Musidorus finished the combat by the death of both the Giants, and
the taking of Otanes prisoner. To whom as he gave his life, so he got a noble
friend: for so he

But thither (understanding of our being there) flocked great multitudes of
many great persons, and even of Princes; especially those, whom we had made
beholding unto us: as, the Kings of Phrygia, Bythinia, with those two hurt, of
Pontus Galatia, and Otanes the prisoner, by Musidorus set free; and thither
came Plexirtus of Trebisonde, and Antiphilus, then King of Lycia; with as many
mo great Princes, drawn either by our reputation, or by willingness to
acknowledge themselves obliged unto us, for what we had done for the others. So
as in those parts of the woild, I think, in many hundreds of years, there
was not seen so

But we quickly aweary thereof, hasted to Greece^ward, led thither partly with
the desire of our parents, but hastened principally, because I understood that
Anaxius with open mouth of defamation had gone thither to seek me, and was now
come to Peloponnesus where from Court to Court he made enquyrie of me, doing
yet Argalus and Amphialus (two Antiphilus, Erona) conveyed us. And there found
we a ship most royally furnished by Plexirtus, who had made all things so
proper (as well for our defense, as ease) that all the other Princes greatly
commended him for it: who (seeming a quite altered man) had nothing but
repentance in his eyes, friendship in his gesture, and virtue in his mouth: so
that we who Zelmane to pardon him, now not only forgave, but began to favor;
persuading our selves with a youthful credulity, that pechance things were
not so evil as we took them and as it were desiring our own memory, that
it might be so. But so were we licensed from those Princes, truly not without
tears, especially of the virtuous Leonatus, who with the king of Pontus, would
have Greece, made them leave that motion, when they found that more ships, then
one, would be displeasing unto us. But so committing our selves to the
uncertain discretion of the wind, we (then determining Greece, to take the
names of Daiphantus and Palladius as well for our own promise to Zelmane, as
because we desired to come unknown into Greece) left the Asian shore full of
Princely persons, who even upon their knees recommended our safeties to the
devotion of their chief desires: among whom none had been so officious
(though I dare affirm, all quite contrary to his unfaithfulness) Plexirtus.

And So having sailed almost two days, looking for nothing but when we might
look upon the land, a grave m^n (whom we had seen of great trust with
Plexirtus and was sent as our principal guide) came unto us, and with a
certain kind manner mixed with shame, and repentance, began to tell us, that he
had taken such a love unto Plexirtus, as that he had committed unto him even
those secrets of his heart, which abhorde all other knowledge; yet he rather
chose to reveal at this time a most pernicious counsel; then by councealing it
bring to ruin those, whom he could not choose but honor. So went he on, and
told us, that Plexirtus (in hope thereby Artaxia, endowed with the great
Kingdom of Armenia, to his wife) had given him order when we were near
Greece, to find some opportunity to murder us, bidding him to take us a
sleep, because he had seen what we could do waking. Now sirs (said he) I
would rather a thousand times loose my life, then have my remembrance (while I
lived) poisoned with such a mischief: and therefore if it were only I, that
knew herein the Kings order, then should my disobedience be a warrant of your
safety. But to one more (said he) namely the Captain of the ship,
Plexirtus has opened so much touching the effect of murdering you, though I
think Artaxia. And my self, (before the consideration of your excellencies had
drawn love and pity into mind imparted it to such, as I thought fittest for
such a mischief. Therefore, I wish you to stand upon your guard assuring you,
that what I can do for your safety, you shall see (if it come to the pushe) by
me performed. We thanked him, as the matter indeed

But when we came within half a days sailing of the shore, so that they saw
it Plexirtus bad him, he would not stick to kill God him self. And therewith
called his mates,

But then we knew it time rather to encounter, then wait for mischief. And so
against the Captain we went, who straight was enuironned with most part of
the Soldiers and Mariners. And yet the truth is, there were some, whom was
reduced to exceeding few, when of those few the most part weary of those
troubles leapt into the boat, which was fast to the ship: but while they that
were first, were cutting of the rope that tied it, others came leaping in, so
disorderly, that they drowned both the boat, and themselves.

Cadmus) we continued still to slay one an other, a fire, which (whether by the
desperate malice of some, or intention to separate, or accidentally while all
things were cast up and down) it should seem had taken a good while before,
but never heeded of us, (who only thought to preserve, or revenge) now
violently burst out in many places, and began

So that we were constrained to bide it no longer, but disarming and stripping
our selves, and laying our selves upon such things, as we thought might help
our swimming to the land (too far for our own strength to bear us) my cousin
and I threw Laconia.

But what (said Philoclea) became of your cousin Musidorus? Lost said
Pyrocles. Ah my Pyrocles, said Philoclea, I am glad I have taken you. I
perceive you loue^^ do not always say truly: as though I knew not your
cousin Dorus, the sheepeheard? Life of my desires (said Pyrocles) what is mine,
even to my soul is you^^ but the secret Pyrocles, I long to hear out till
your meeting me: for there to me-ward is the best part of your story. Ah sweet
Philoclea (said Pyrocles) do you think I can think so precious leisure as
this well spent in talking. Are your eyes a fit book (think you) to read a
tale upon? Is my love quiet enough to be an historian? Dear Princess, be
gracious unto me. And then he feign would have remembered to have forgot
himself. But she, Pyrocles (said she) let me have my story. Sweet Princess
(said he) give my thoughts Erona was betrayed into such danger, and why Plangus
sought me. For indeed, I should pity greatly any mischance fallen to that
Princess. I will, said Philoclea smiling, so you give me your word, your
hands shall be quiet auditors. Pyrocles could not choose but rebel so far, as
to kiss her. She would have pulled her head away, and speak, but while she
spoke he kissed, and it seemed he fed upon her words: but she gate away. How
will you have your discourse (said she) without you let my Miso: who taking her
time, while Basilius back was turned, came unto them: and told Philoclea, she
deserved she knew what, for leaving her mother, being evil at ease, to keep
company with strangers. But Philoclea telling her, that Gynecia, who was at
that time miserably vexed with this manner of dream. It seemed unto her to be
in a place full of thorns, which so molested her, as she could neither abide
standing Zelmane, being upon a fair hill, delightful to the eye, and easy in
appearance, called her thither: whither with much anguish being come, Zelmane
was vanished, and she found nothing but a dead body like unto her husband,
which seeming at the first with a strange smell to infect her, as she was ready
likewise within a while to die, the dead body she thought Gynecia, leave all;
for here is thy only rest.

With that she awaked, crying very loud, Zelmane, Zelmane. But remembering her
self, and seeing Basilius by, (her guilty conscience more suspecting, then
being suspected she turned her call, and called for Philoclea. Miso forthwith
like a valiant shrew, (looking at Basilins, as though she would speak though
she died for it) told Gynecia, Zelmane: And (says she) for my part I could
not be heard (your daughters are brought up in such awe) though I told her of
your pleasure sufficiently. Gynecia, as if she had heard her last doom
pronounced against her, with a side-looke and changed countenance, O my Lord
(said she) what mean you to suffer these young folks together Basilius (that
aimed nothing at the mark of her suspicion) smilingly took her in his arms,
sweet wife (said he) I thank you for your care of your child: but they must
be youths of other metal, then Zelmane, that can endaunger her. O but; cried
Gynecia, and therewith she stayed: for then indeed she did suffer a right
conflict, betwixt the force of love, and rage of jealousy. Many times was she
about to satisfy the spite of her mind, and tell Basilius, how she knew
Zelmane to be far Basilius, (with a kindness flowing only from the
fountain of unkindness,

But the great and wretched Lady Gynecia, possessed with those devils of Love
and Jealousy, did rid herself from her tedious husband: and taking no body
with Gynecia, Gynecia (said she sighing) thought wise, and once virtuous? Alas
it is thy breeders Philoclea, appears more horrible in my sight, then the
image of death. Then remembered she this song, which she thought With two
strange fires of equal heat possessed,
The one of Love, the other Jealousy,
Both still do work, in neither find I rest:

The one aloft does hold, the other hie.
Love wakes the the jealous eye least thence it moves:
The jealous eye, the more it looks, it loves.

They feed on me, and with my wings do fly:
My lovely joys to doleful ashes turn:
Their flames mount up, my powers prostrate lie:
They live in force. I quite consumed die.

The fuel small: how be the fires so great?
But her vnleasured thoughts ran not over the ten first words; but going with
a pace, not so much to fast for her body, as slow for her mind, she found
them together, Misos departure, had left their tale, and determined what to say
to Basilius. But full abashed was poor Philoclea, (whose conscience now began
to know cause of blushing) for first salutation, receiving an eye from her
mother, full of the same disdainefull scorn, which Pallas showed to poor
Arachne, that durst contend with her for the prize of well weauing: yet did the
force of love so much rule her, that though for Zelmanes sake she did detest
her, yet for Zelmanes sake she used no harder words to her, then to bid her go
home, and accompany her solitary father.

Then began she to display to Zelmane the storehouse of her deadly desires,
when Zelmane to break of any such conference, (for well she found, they were
not friendly voices they heard) and to retire with as much diligence as
conveniently they could toward the lodge. Yet before they could win the
lodge by twenty paces, they were overtaken by an unruly sort of clownes, and
other rebels, which like a violent

Zelmane (whose virtuous courage was ever awake) drew out her sword, which upon
those il-armed churls giving as many wounds as blows and as many deaths
Basilius (having put on an armor long untried) came to prove his authority
among his subjects, or at lest, to adventure his life with his dear mistress,
to who^ he brought a shield, while the Ladies tremblingly atte^ded the issue of
this dangerous adventure. Zelmane made them perceive the ods between an Eagle
and a Kight, with such a nimble stayednes, and such an assured nimblenes, that
while one was running back fear, his fellow had her sword in his guts.

And by and by was both her heart and help well increased by the coming of
Dorus, who having been making of hurdles for his masters sheep, heard the
Pamelas lodge, but found her in a cave hard by, with Mopsa and Dametas, who at
that time would not have opened the entry to his father. And therefore leaving
them there (as in a place safe, both for being strong, and unknown) he ran
and eyes threatening more in the retiring, then they did in the advancing: so
guided they themselves homeward, never stepping step backward, but that they
proved themselves masters of the ground where they stepped.

Yet among the rebels there was a dapper fellow, a tailor by occupation, who
Zelmane. But as he came within her distance, turning his swerd very nicely
about his crown, Basilius, with a side blow, struck off his nose. He (being a
suitor to a seimsters daughter, and therefore not a little grieved for such a
disgrace) stouped down, because he had hard, that if it were fresh put to, it
would Zelmane with a blow, sent his head to his nose. That saw a butcher, a
butcherly chuffe indeed (who that day was sworn brother to him in a cup of
wine) and lifted up a great leauer, calling Zelmane all the vile names of a
butcherly eloquence. But she (letting slip the blow of the leauer) hitte him
so surely upon the side of his Dorus: but the nimblenes of the wine carried his
head so fast, that it made it overrun his feet, so that he fell withal,
just between the legs of Dorus: who setting Dorus (leaving the miller to vomit
his soul out in wine and blood) with his two-hand sword struck off another
quite by the waste, Centaures and Lapithes, and had been very desirous to see
some notable wounds, to be able the Dorus (with a turn of his sword) struck
off both his hands. And so the painter returned, well skilled in wounds, but
with never a hand to perform his skill.

Philoclea, who ever caught hold of Zelmane, so (by the folly of love)
hindering the succor which Zelmane seeing no way of defense, nor time to
deliberate (the number of t^^^e villains still increasing, and their madness
still increasing with their number) thought it only the means to go beyond
their expectation with an unused boldness, and with danger to avoid danger:
and therefore opened again the ^ate, and ( Dorus and Basilius standing ready
for her defense) she issued of the Prince, which (according to the guise of
that country) was before the court gate. There she paused a while, making
sign with her hand unto them, and withal, speaking aloud, that she had
something to say unto them, that would please them. But she was answered awhile
with nothing but shouts and cries; and some beginning to throw stones at her,
not daring to approach her. But at length, a young Zelmane) hoping by this
kindness to have some good of her, desired them, if they were honest men, to
hear the woman speak. Fie fellows, fie, (said he) what will all the maids
in our town say, if so many tall men shall be afraid to hear a fair wench?
I swear unto you by no little ones, I had rather give

It is no small comfort unto me (said she) having to speak something unto you
for your own behoofs, to find that I have to deal with such a people, who
show indeed in themselves the right nature of valor, which as it leaves no
violence unattempted, while the choler is nourished with resistance; so when
the subject of Basilius himself in person is within this Lodge, and was one of
the three, whom a few of you went about to fight withal: (and this she said,
not doubting but they knew it well enough;

This (being more then they hoped for from their Prince) assuaged well their
fury, and many of them consented (especially the young farmer helping on, who
Zelmane for his wife) but when they began to talk of their grieves, never Bees
made such a confused humming: the town dwellers demanding putting down of
imposts: the country fellows laying out of commons: some would have the Prince
keep his Co^rt in one place, some in another. All cried out to have new
counselors: but whe^^^^ should such as Cooks, Barbers, and those other that
lived most on Gentlemen) would but have them reformed. And of each side were
like diuisio^s, one neighborhood beginning to find fault with another. But no
confusion was greater then of particular men's likings and dislikings: one
dispraising such a one, whom another praised, Zelmane (finding that their
united rage was now grown, not only to a dividing, but to a crossing one of
another, and that the mislike grown among themselves did well allay the heat
against her) made tokens again unto them (as though she took great care of
their well doing, and were afraid of their falling out) that she would speak
unto them. They now Zelmane (by the acquaintance she had had with such kind
of humors) soon perceiving, with an angerles bravery, and an vnabashed
mildnes, in this manner spoke unto them.

Arcadians, that a woman should give public counsel to men, a stranger to the
country people, and that lastly in such a presence by a private person, the
regal throne should be possessed. But the strangenes of your action makes that
used for virtue, which your violent necessity imposes. For certainly, a
woman may well speak to such men, who have forgotten Arcadians, and be
ashamed: against whom has this zealous rage been stirred? whether have been
bent these ma^ful Argians your ancient enemies, nor Laconians your now feared
neighbors. Here be nether hard landlords, nor biting usurers. Here lodge none,
but such, as either you have great cause to love, or no cause to hate: here
being none, besides your Prince, Princess, and their children, but my self. Is
it I then, o Arcadians, against whom your anger is armed? Arcadians, if that
may satisfy you; rather then you (called over the world the wise and quiet
Arcadians) should be so vain, as to attempt that alone, which all the rest of
your country will abhor; then you should show your selves so ungrateful, as
to forget the fruit of so person; which no successor, though never so
hateful, will ever leave (for his own sake) unrevenged. Neither can your
wonted valor be turned to such a baseness, as in stead of a Prince, delivered
unto you by so many royal ancestors, to take the tyrannous yoke of your fellow
subject, in whom the innate means will bring forth ravenous covetousness, and
the newnes of his estate, suspectfull cruelty. Imagine, Basilius? under whose
ensign would you go, if your enemies should invade you? If you cannot agree
upon one to speak for you, how will you agree upon one to fight for you? But
with this fear of I cannot tell what, one is troubled, and with that passed
wrong another is grieved. And I pray you did the Sun ever bring you a
fruitful harvest, but that it was more hot then pleasant? Have any of

The action Zelmane used, being beautified by nature and apparelled with skill,
her gestures being such, that as her words did paint out her mind, so they
served Zelmane thinking it no evil way in such mutinies, to give the mutinous
some occasion of such service, as they might think (in their own judgment)
would counteruaile their trespass, withal, to take the more assured
possession of their minds, which she feared might begin to waver, Loiall
Arcadians (said she) now do I offer unto you the manifesting of your Clinias,
to himself, when he saw the word no sooner out of Zelmanes mouth, but that
there were some shouts of joy, with, God save Basilius, and diverse of them with
much iollity grown to be his guard, that but little before meant to be his
murderers.

This Clinias in his youth had been a scholar so far, as to learn rather
words then manners, and of words rather plenty then order; and often had used to
be an

Cecropia, Amphialus his mother, so that he was privy to all the mischievous
devises, wherewith she went about to ruin Basilius, and his children, for the
aduauncing of her son: and though his education had made him full of tongue,
yet his love to be doing, taught him in any evil to be secret; and had by his
mistress been used (ever since the strange retiring Basilius) to whisper
rumors into the peoples ears: and this time (finding great aptnes in the
multitude) was one of the chief that set them in the uproar (though quite
without the consent of Amphialus, who would not for all the Kingdoms of the
world so have adventured the life of Philoclea.) But now perceiving the flood
of Basilius. And some of the lustiest rebels not yet agreeing to the rest, he
caused two or three of his mates that were at his commandment to lift him up,
and then as if he had had a prologue to utter, he began with a nice gravity to
demand audience. But few attending what he said, with vehement gesture,
Zelmane, but Basilius might hear him. O unhappy men, more mad then the Giants
that would have plucked Jupiter out of heaven, how long shall this rage
continue? why do you not all throw down your weapons, and submit your selves
to our good Prince, our good Basilius, the Pelops of wisdom, and Minos of all
good government? when will you begin to believe me, and other honest and
faithful

The farmer that loved Zelmane could abide him no longer. For as at the first
he was willing to speak of conditions, hoping to have gotten great
souerainties, and among the rest Zelmane: so now perceiving, that the people,
once anything down the hill from their fury, would never stay till they came
to the bottom of absolute the chiefest make-bates, struck him a great wound
upon the face with his sword. The cowardly wretch fell down, crying for
succor, and (scrambling through the legs of them that were about him) gat to
the throne, where Zelmane took him, and comforted him, bleeding for that was
past, and quaking for fear of more.

But as soon as that blow was given (as if AEolus had broke open the door to
let Basilius were intermingled with them that would not yield. These men
thinking their ruin stood upon it; those men to get favor of their Prince,
converted their ungracious motion into their own bowels, and by a Zelmane; and
Basilius with Dorus issued, and Zelmane striking the farmer to the heart with
her sword, as before she had done with her eyes) that in a while all they of
the contrary side were put to flight, and fled to certain woods upon the
frontiers; where feeding wildly, and drinking only water, they were
disciplined Basilius calling them together, partly for policy sake, but
principally because Zelmane before had spoken it (which was to him more then a
divine ordinance) he pronounced their general pardon, willing them to return
to their houses, and thereafter Clinias to be one of the chief that had bred
this good alteration, he gave him particular thanks, and withal willed him to
make him know, how this frenzy had entered into the people.

Clinias purposing indeed to tell him the truth of all, saving what did touch
Cecropia, first, dipping his hand in the blood of his wound, Now by this blood
(said he) which is more dear to me, then all the rest that is in my body, since
it is spent for your safety: this tongue (perchance unfortunate, but never false)
shall not now begin to lie unto my Prince, of me most beloved. Then stretching
out his hand, and making vehement countenances the vshers to his speches, in
such manner of Enispus, to do honor to the day, were a four or five thousand
people (of all conditions, as I think) gathered together, spending all the day
in dancings and other exercises: and when night came, under tents and bows
making great cheer, and meaning to observe a wassaling watch all that Bacchus
(the learned say) was begot with thunder: I think, that made him ever since so
full of stur and debate. Bacchus indeed it was which sounded the first trumpet
to this rude Alaru^. For that barbarous opinion being generally among the^, to
think with vice to do honor, and with actiuitie in beastlines to show abundance
of love, made most of them seek to show the depth of their affection in the
depth of of living, there was no matter their ears had ever heard of that gr^w
not to be a subject of their winie conference. I speak it by proof: for I
take witness of the Gods (who never leave periuries unpunished) that I often
cried out against their impudency, and (when that would not serve) stopped mine
ea^es, because I would not Arcadia were grown loathsome in your sight) why you
did Arcadia will follow. Let us deliver our Prince from danger of practices,
and our selves that folly, that the more it seeks to hurt, the less it
considers how to be able to hurt: they never wayed how to arm themselves but
took up every thing for a weapon, that fury offered to their hands. Many
swords, pikes, and bills there were: others took pitchforkes and rakes,
converting husbandry to souldierie some caught hold of spittes (things
serviceable for life) to be the instruments of Arcadia) had not showed their
miraculous power, and that they had not used for instruments, both your own
valor (not fit to be spoken of by so mean a mouth as mine) and some (I must
confess) honest minds, (whom alas why should I mention, since what we did,
reached not to the Arcadians.

With that the fellow did wring his hands, and wrang out tears: so as
Basilius, that was not the sharpest pearcer into masked minds, took a good
liking to him; and so much the more as he had tickled him with praise in the
hearing of his mistres. And Philanax, and an other to other principal
noblemen, and cities there

This, Clinias (having his ear one way when his eye was an other) had
perceived Cecropia that she was to take some speedy resolution, or else it were
danger those examinations would both discover, and ruin her: and so went his
way, leaving that little company with embracements, and praising of Zelmanes
excellent proceeding, to show, that no decking sets forth any thing so much,
as affection. For as, while she stood at the discretion of those indiscreet
Greece could ever allege of wit and fortitude, were set in the rank of
trifles, being compared

But as they were in the midst of those unfeigned ceremonies, a Gitterne,
ill-played on, accompanied with a hoarce voice (who seemed to sing maugre the
Muses, and to be merry in spite Fortune) made them look the way of the
ill-noysed song. The song was this.


A blooddy help with blood to save:
A foolish thing with fools to deal:
Let him be bob'd that bobs will have.
But who by means of wisdom hie

Let others deck their pride with skarres,
And of their wounds make lame shows:
First let them die, then pass the stars,

But eye from blade, and ear from cry:
Who has saved all? it is even I.
They had soon found it was Dametas, who came with no less lifted up
countenance, Pamela (who had now experienced how Basilius with the sight of
Pamela (of whom almost his head otherwise occupied, had l^ft the wonted
remembrance) was suddenly stricken into a devout kind of admiration, remembering
Zelmane) he thought the Gods in their oracles did principally mind her.

But as he was deeply thinking of the matter, one of the shepheardes told
him, Philanax was already come with a hundred horse in his company. For having
by chance rid not far of the little desert, he had heard of this uproar, and
so was come upon the spur (gathering a company of Gentlemen as fast as he
could) to the succor of his Master. Basilius was glad of it; but not willing
to have him, nor any other of the Noble men, see his Mistress) he himself
went out of the Lodge, Philanax with humble earnestness beginning to entreat
him to leave of this solitary course (which already had been so dangerous
unto him) Well (said Basilius) it may be ere long I will condescend unto your
desire. In the mean time, take you the best order you can to keep me safe in
my solitatinesse. But, (said he) do^ Philanax) for though it pleased you not as
then to let me know, what the Oracles words were, yet all Oracles holding (in
my conceit) one degree of reputation, it suffised me to know, it was but an
Oracle, which led you from your own course. Well (said Basilius) I will now
tell you the words; which before I thought not good to do; because when all
the events fall out (as some already have done) I may charge you with your
incredulity. So he repeated them in this sort.

THy elder care shall from thy careful face
By princely mean be stolen, and yet not lost.
Thy younger shall with Natures bliss embrace
And uncouth love, which Nature hates most.
Both they themselves unto such two shall wed,
Who at thy beer, as at a bar, shall plead;
Why thee (a living man) they had made dead.
In thy own seat a foreign state shall fit.
And ere that all these blows thy head do hit,
Thou, with thy wife, adultry shall commit.
For you forsooth (said he) whn I told you, that some supernatural cause sent
me strange visions, which being confirmed with presagious chances, I had gone
to Delphos, and there received this answer, you replied to me, that the only
supernatural Zelmane, but not as I feared, to my ruin, but to my
preservation. But when he had once named Zelmane, that name was as good as a
pully, to make the clock of his praises run on in such sort, that ( Philanax
found) was more exquisite then the only admiration of Basilius had enjoined
unto him.

Basilius returned into the Lodge, thus by him self construing the oracle,
that in that he said, his elder care should by Princely mean be stolen away
from him, Zelmane had as it were robbed from him the care of his first begotten
child, yet was it not lost, since in his heart the ground of it remained. That
his younger should with Natures bliss embrace the love of Zelmane, because he
had so commanded her for his sake to do; yet should it be with as much hate
of Nature, for being so hateful an opposite to the jealousy Zelmane, whom
afterward he should have to his wife. The point of his daughters marriage,
because it threatened his death withal, he determined to prevent with keeping
them (while he Apollo: and even then began with his wife and daughters to singe
this Hymn, by them yearly used.

APollo great, whose beams the greater world do light,

Which ever shine, though hid from earth by earthly shade,
Whose lights do ever live, but in our darkness fade;
Thou God, whose youth was decked with spoil of Phythons skin:
(So humble knowledge can throw down the snakish sin)
Latonas son, whose birth in pain and travail long
Does teach, to learn the good what travails do belong:
In travail of our life (a short but tedious space)
While brickle houreglas runs, guide thou our panting pace:
Give us foresightfull minds: give us minds to obaye

Let so our fruits grow up that nature be maintainde:
But so our hearts keep down, with vice they be not stainde.
Let this assured hold our iudgemeuts overtake,
That nothing winnes the heaven, but what does earth forsake.
As Soon as he had ended his devotion (all the privileged shepherds being now
come) knowing well enough he might lay all his care upon Philanax, he was
willing to sweeten the taste of this passed tumult, with some rural pastimes.
For which while the shepherds prepared themselves in their best manner,
Basilius took his daughter Philoclea aside, and with such have, as if his
ears hunted for words, desired to know how she had found Zelmane. She humbly
answered him, according to the agreement betwixt them, that thus much for her
sake Zelmane was content to descend from her former resolution, as to hear
him, whenever he would speak; and further then that (she said) as Zelmane
had not granted, so she nether did, nor ever Basilius kissed her with more then
fatherly thanks, and straight (like a hard-kept ward new come to his lands)
would feign have used the benefit of that grant, in laying his sickness before
his only physician. But Zelmane (that had not yet fully determined with her
self, how to bear her self toward him) made him in a few words understand,
that the time in respect of the company was unfit for such Eronas distress
(whom in her travail she had known, and been greatly beholding to) she
desired him to finish the rest, for so far as Plangus had told him; Because she
said (and she said truly) she was full of care for that Lady, whose desert
(only except an ouer-base choice) was nothing agreeable Basilius glad that she
would command him any thing, but more glad, that in excusing the unfitness of
that time, she argued an intention to grant a fitter obeyed her in this manner.

Madam (said he) it is very true, that since years enhabled me to judge what
is, or is not to be pitied. I never saw any thing that more moved me to
justify a vehement as I could not temper my long idle pen in that subject,
which I perceive you have seen. But then to leave that vnrepeated, which I
find my daughters have told you It may please you to understand, since it
pleases you to demand, that Antiphilus being crowned, and so left by the
famous Princes Musidorus and Pyrocles (led thence by the challenge of Anaxius,
who is now in these provinces of Greece making a dishonorable Pyrocles already
perished) Antiphilus (I say) being crowned, and delivered from the presence of
those two, whose virtues (while they were present^ good schoolmasters)
suppressed his vanities, he had not strength of mind enough in him to make
long delay, of discovering what manner of man he was. But straight like one
carried up to so hie a place, that he loses the Eronas ancestors, and like
the foolish bird, that when it so hides the head that it sees not it self,
thinks no body else sees it: so did he imagine, that no body knew his
baseness, while he himself turned his eyes from it.

Then vainenesse (a meager friend to gratefulness) brought him so to despise
Erona, Erona, underhand, by messages sought Artaxia, who no less hating him,
then loving (as unlucky a choice) the naughty King Plexirtus, yet to bring to
pass what she purposed, was content to train him into false hopes, Armenia,
and had made that, but the foundation of more, and more monarchies; as if
fortune had only gotten eyes to cherish him. In which time a great assembly of
most part of all the Princes of Asia being to do honor to the never
sufficiently praised Pyrocles and Musidorus, he would be one not to
acknowledge his obligation (which was as great as any of the others,) him then
otherwise, he was quickly (as standing upon no true ground, inwardly) out of
countenance with himself, till his seldom-comfortlesse ^latterers (persuading
him, it was envy and fear of his expected greatness) made him have away from
that company, and without further delay appointed the meeting with Artaxia;
Erona to all this obeyed, either vehemence of affection making her stoop to so
ouerbase a servitude, or astonished with an unlooked for fortune, dull to any
behoofefull resolution, or (as many times it falls out Artaxia, that she was
content; for the public good, to be a second wife, and yield the first place
to her: nay to extol him, and even woo Artaxia for him.

Artaxia (mortally hating them both for her brothers sake) was content to hide
her hate, till she had time to show it: and pretending that all her grudge was
against the two paragons of virtue, Musidorus and Pyrocles, even met them half
way in excusing her brothers murder, as not being principal actors; and of the
otherside, driven to what they did by the euer-pardonable necessity: and so
well handled Antiphilus promised himself all that she would have him think.
And so a solemn enteruiew was appointed. But (as the Poets say) Hymen had not
there his saffron-coloured cote. For Artaxia laying men secretly (and easily
they might be secret, since Antiphilus thought she ouerran him in love) when he
came even ready to embrace her, showing rather a Antiphilus she caused him and
Erona both to be put in irons, hasting back toward her brothers tomb, upon
which she meant to sacrifice them; making the love of her brother stand between
her and

But great diversity in them two quickly discovered it self for the bearing
of that affliction. For Antiphilus that had no greatness but outward, that
taken away, was ready to fall faster then calamity could thrust him; with
fruitless begging of life (where reason might well assure him his death was
resolved) and weak bemoning Erona sad indeed, yet like one rather used, then
new fallen to sadness (as who had the joys of her heart already broken)
seemed rather to welcome then to shun that end of misery, speaking little,
but what she spoke was for Antiphilus, remembering his guiltlesnesse, Tiridates,
when the valiant princes slew him: to the disgrace of men, showing that there
are women both more wise to judge what is to be expected, and more constant to
bear it when it is happened.

But her wit endeared by her youth, her affliction by her birth, and her
sadness by her beauty, made this noble prince Plangus, who (never almost from
his cousin Artaxia) was now present at Eronaes taking, to perceive the shape of
loveliness more perfectly in woe, then in ioyfulnesse (as in a picture which
receives greater life by the darkness of shadows, then by more glittering
colors) and seeing to like; and liking to love; and loving straight to feel
the most incident effects of love, to serve and preserve. So borne by the
hasty tide of short leisure, he did hastily deliver together his affection,
and affectionate care. But she (as if he had spoken of a small matter, when he
mentioned her life, to which she had not leisure to attend) desired him if he
loved her, to show it, in finding some way to save Antiphilus. Antiphilus were
saved. He told me how much he argued against her tende^ing Antiphilus: a man
whom he not only hated, as a traitor to Erona, but envied as a possessor of
Erona. Yet Love swear, his heart, in spite of his heart, should make him become a
servant to his rival. And so did he, seeking all the means of persuading
Artaxia, which the authority of so near, and so virtuous Tiridates (which was
very nere) to execute Antiphilus, and at the day of his death (which was about
half a year after) to use the same rigor toward Erona. much grieved (because
much loving) attempted the humors of the Lycians, to see, whether they would
come in with forces to succor their Princess. But there the next inheritor to
the crown (with the true play that is used in the game of kingdo^s) had no
sooner his mistres in captivity, but he had usurped her place, and making her
odious to her people, because of the unfit election she had made, had so
Artaxia, persuading the iusticing her, because that injustice might give his
title the name of justice. Wanting that way, Plangus practiced with some dear
friends of his, to save Antiphilus out of prison, whose day because it was much
nearer then Eronaes, and that he well found, she had twisted her life upon the
same thread with his, he determined first to get him out of Artaxia had set
many of Tiridates old servants to have well-marking eyes, he co^ferred with
Antiphilus, as (by the authority he had) he found means to do; and agreed
with him of the time and manner, how he should by the death of some of his
iaylors escape. But all being well ordered, and Plangus willingly putting
himself Antiphilus (who, like a bladder, sweld ready to break, while it was
full of the wind of prosperity, that being out, was so abiected, as apt to be
trod on by every body) when it came to the point, that with some hazard, he
might be in apparent likelihood to avoid the uttermost harm, his heart fainted,
and (weak fool, neither hoping, nor fearing as he should) gat a conceit, that
with bewraying Plangus should have come unto him, opened the whole practice to
him that had the charge, with vnpittyed tears idly protesting, he had rather
die by Artaxias commandment, then against her will escape: yet begging life
upon any the hardest, and wretchedest conditions that she would lay upon him.
His keeper provided accordingly, so that when Plangus came, he was like,
himself to have been entrapped: Artaxia (accounting him most ungrateful,
considering that her brother and she, had not only preserved him against the
malice of his father, but ever used him much liker his birth, then his fortune)
sent forces to apprehend him. But he among Eronas adversity.

But for the succor of Antiphilus he could get no body to join with him, the
contempt of him having not been able to qualify the hatred; so that Artaxia
might easily upon him perform her will; which was (at the humble suite of
all the women Polygamie, after many tortures, forced him to throw himself from
a high Pyramid, which was built over Tiridates tomb, and so to end his
false-harted life, which had planted no strong thought in him, but that he
could be unkind.

Plangus well perceiving that Artaxia stayed only for the appointed day, that
the fair Eronas body, (consumed to ashes) should make a notorious testimony,
how deeply her brothers death was engraven in her breast, he assembled good
numbers of friends, whom his virtue (though a stranger) had tied unto him, by
force to give her liberty. Contrariwise, Artaxia, to whom Anger gave more
Plangus, who indeed (as all men witness) is one of the best captains (both for
policy and valor) that are trained in the school of Mars, in Artaxias power,
though of far greater number: and there took prisoner a base son of her
brothers, whom she deerly affected, and then sent her word that he should run
the same race of fortune (whatsoever it was) that Erona did: and happy was that
threatening for her; for else Artaxia had hastened the day of her death, in
respect of those tumults.

Erona) delivered, she should be put into the hands of a principal nobleman,
who had a castle of great strength, upon oath, that if by the day two year
from Tiridates death, Pyrocles and Musidorus did not in person combat, and
overcome two knights, whom Erona and them, of having by treason destroyed her
brother, that then Erona should be that same day burned to ashes: but if they
came, and had the victory, she should be delivered; but upon no occasion,
neither freed, nor executed, till that day. And hereto of both sides, all took
solemn oath, and so the peace was concluded; they of Plangus party forcing
him to agree, though he himself the sooner condiscended, knowing the courtesy
of those two Artaxia was more, and upon better ground, pleased with this
action; for she had even newly received news from Plexirtus, that upon the sea
he had caused them both to perish, and therefore she held her self sure of the
match.

But poor Plangus knew not so much, and therefore seeing his party (as most
times it falls out in like case) hungry of any conditions of peace, accepted
them; and then obtained leave of the Lord, that indifferently kept her, to
visit Erona, Plangus came to her, she fell in deadly traunces, as if in him
she had seen the death of Antiphilus, because he had not succored him: and
yet (her virtue striving) she did at one time acknowledge her self bound, and
profess her self injured; in steed of allowing the conclusion they had made,
or writing to the Princes (as he wished her to do) craving nothing but some
speedy death to follow, Antiphilus.

So that Plangus having nothing but a ravished kiss from her hand at their
parting, went away toward Greece, whetherward he understood the Princes were
embarked. But by the way it was his fortune to intercept letters, written by
Artaxia to Plexirtus: wherein she signified her accepting him to her husband,
whom she had Plexirtus ship. Whereupon (to make more diligent search) he
took ship himself, and came into Laconia, enquiring, and by his inquiry
finding, that such a Pyrocles and Musidorus, it was assuredly determined that
they were cast away: for the name of such Princes (especially in Greece) would
quickly else have been a large witness to the contrary. Full of grief with
that, for the loss of such, who left the world poor of perfection: but more
sorry for Eronas sake, who now by them Armenia ouertooke him, which multiplied
the force of his anguish. It was a message from the Nobleman who had Erona in
ward, giving him to understand, that since his departure, Artaxia (using the
benefit of time) had besieged him in his castle, demanding present delivery
of her, whom yet for his faith given, he would not, before the day appointed,
Armenia, were consumed, and Artaxia had increased her might by marriage of
Plexirtus, Pyrocles and Musidorus, as having just cause thereto, in respect of
the deaths of his sister Andromana, her son his nephew, and his own daughter
Zelmane, all whose loss he unjustly charged them withal, and now openly
stickt not to confess, what a revenge his wit had brought forth. Plangus much
astonished herewith, bethought himself what to Armenia was vain, since his
friends there were utterly overthrown. Then thought he of going to his father;
but he had already (even since the death of his stepmother, and brother)
attempted the recovering his favor, and all in vain. For they, that had
before joined with Andromana to do him the wrong, thought now no life for them
if he returned, and therefore kept him still (with new forged suspicions)
odious to his father. So that Plangus reserving that for a work Erona could
bear, determined to go to the mighty and good King Euarchus: who lately
having (to his eternal fame) fully, not only conquered his enemies, but
established good government in their countries, he hoped he might have present
succor of him, both for the iustnes of the cause, and revenge of his childrens
death, by so heinous a treason murdered. Therefore Erona at a stake before his
eyes; such an apprehension he had taken of her danger; which in despite of all
the comfort I could give him, he poured out in such lamentations, that I was
moved not to let him Euarchus: for my part having had some of his speeches so
feelingly in my memory, that at an idle time (as I told you) I set them down
Dialogue-wise, Zelmane (sighing for Eronaes sake, yet inwardly comforted in
that she assured Euarchus would not spare to take in hand the just delivering
of her, joined with the just revenge of his childrens loss) having now what
she desired of Basilius, to avoid his further discourses of affection,
encouraged the shepherds to begin, whom she saw already ready for them.


THE rude tumult of the Enispians gave occasion to the honest shepherds to
begin their Pastoralls this day with a dance, which they called the skirmish
betwixt Reason and Passion. For seven shepherds (which were named the R. Thou
Rebel vile, come, to thy master yield.



And the other that met with him answered: P. No, Tyrant, no: mine, mine shall
be the field,

Can Reason then a Tyrant counted be?

Passion. If Reason will, that Passions be not free.

R. But Reason will, that Reason govern most.

P. And Passion will, that Passion rule the roast.

R. Your will is will, but Reason reason is.

P. Will has his will, when Reasons will does miss.

R. Whom Passion leads unto his death is bent.

P. And let him die, so that he die content.

R. By nature you to Reason faith have sworn.

P. Not so, but fellow-like together borne.

R. Who Passion does ensue, lives in annoy.

P. Who Passion does forsake, lives void of joy.

R. Passion is blind, and treades an unknown trace.

P. Reason has eyes to see his own ill case.



Then as they approached nearer, the two of Reasons side, as if they shot at the
other, thus sang: R. Dare Passions then abide in Reasons light?

P. And is not Reason dim with Passions might?

R. O foolish thing, which glory does destroy.

P. O glorious title of a foolish toy.

R. Weakness you are, dare you with our strength fight?

P. Because our weakness weakeneth all your might.

R. O sacred Reason, help our virtuous toiles.

P. O Passion, pass on feeble Reasons spoils.

R. We with our selves abide a daily strife.

P. We gladly use the sweetness of our life.

R. But yet our strife sure peace in end does breed.

P. We now have peace, your peace we do not need.



Then did the two square battles meet, and in steed of fighting embrace one
another, singing thus: R. We are too strong: but Reason seeks no blood.

P. Who be too weak, do feign they be too good.

R. Though we cannot overcome, our cause is just.

P. Let us overcome, and let us be unjust.

R. Yet Passions yield at length to Reasons stroke.

P. What shall we win by taking Reasons yoke.

R. The joys you have shall be made permanent.

P. But so we shall with grief learn to repent.

R. Repent in deed, but that shall be your bliss.

P. How know we that, since present joys we miss?

R. You know it not: of Reason therefore know it.

P. No Reason yet had ever skill to show it.

R. Then let us both to heavenly rules give place.

P. Which Passions kill, and Reason do deface.



Then embraced they one another, and came to the King, who framed his praises
Zelmanes liking; whose unrestrained parts, the mind and eye had their free
course to the delicate Philoclea, whose look was not short in well requiting
it, although she knew it was a hateful sight to her iealouse mother. But
Dicus (that had in this time taken a great liking of Dorus, for the good parts
he found above his age in him) had a delight to taste the fruits of his wit,
though in a subject

Dicus. Dorus. Dicus. Dorus, tell me, where is thy wonted motion,
To make these woods resound thy lamentation?
Thy saint is dead, or dead is thy devotion,
For who does hold his love in estimation,
To witness that he thinks his thoughts delicious,


Dorus. But what does make thee Dicus so suspicious
Of my due faith, which needs must be immutable?
Who others virtue doubt, themselves are vicious,

Her beams have wrought therein most fair impression,
To such a force some change were nothing suitable.

Dicus. The heart well set does never shun confession:

Silence does seem the mask of base oppression.
Who glories in his love, does make Love glorious:
But who does fear, or bideth muet wilfully,
Shows, guilty heart does deem his state opprobrious.

Yield to our ears a sweet and sound relation,
If Love took thee by force, or caught thee guilefully.

Dorus. If sunnie beams shame heavenly habitation,

Then base and sour is Loves most high vocation.
Or if sheep cries can help the Suns own bravery,
Then may I hope, my pipe may have ability,
To help her praise, who decks me in her slavery,

As for your doubts, her voice was it deceived me,
Her eye the force beyond all possibility.

Dicus. Thy words well voyc'd, well grac'de had almost heaued me,

Till of these thoughts thy sudden end bereaved me,
Go on therefore, and tell us by what fashion
In thy own proof he gets so strange possession,
And how possessed he strengthens his invasion.

Dorus. Sight is his root, in thought is his progression,
His child hood wonder, prentizeship attention,
His youth delight, his age the souls oppression
Doubt is his sleep, he waketh in invention,
Fancy his food, his clothing is of carefulnes;
Beauty his book, his play lovers dissension:
His eyes are ^urious search, but vailde with warefulnesse:
His wings desire often clipped with desperation.
Largess his hands could never skill of sparefulnesse
But how he does by might, or by persuasion
To conquer, and his conquest how to ratify,
Experience doubts, and schools hold disputation.

Dicus. But so thy sheep may thy good wishes satisfy
With large increase, and wool of fine perfection,
So she thy love, her eyes thy eyes may gratify;
As thou will give our souls a dear refection,
By telling how she was, how now she framed is
To help, or hurt in thee her own infection.

Dorus. Blessed be the name, wherewith my mistres named is:
Whose wounds are salues, whose yokes please more then pleasure does
Her stains are beams; virtue the fault she blamed is,
The heart, eye, ear here only find his treasure does.
All numbering arts her endless graces number not:
Time, place, life^ wit, scarcely her rare gifts measure does.
Is she in rage? so is the Sun in summer hot,
Yet harvest brings. Does she, alas! absent her self?
The Sun is hid; his kindly shadows cumber not.
But when to give some grace she does content herself,
O then it shines, then are the heavens distributed,
And Venus seems, to make up her, she spent herself.
Thus then (I say) my mischiefs have contributed
A greater good by her divine reflection,
My harms to me, my bliss to her attributed.
Thus she is framed: her eyes are my direction,
Her love my life, her anger my destruction,
Lastly what so she is, that is my protection.

Dicus. Thy safety sure is wrapped in destruction,
For that construction thine own words do bear.
A man to fear a woman's moodie eye,
Makes Reason lie a slave to servile sense,
A weak defense where weakness is thy force:
So is remorse in folly dearly bought.

Dorus. If I had thought to hear blasphemous words,
My breast to swords, my soul to hell have sold

With words so vile, which viler breath does breed.
O herds take heed; for I a woolfe have found,
Who hunting round the strongest for to kill,
His breast does fill with earth of others woe,

O sheepheards boys, eschew these tongues of venom,
Which do enuenome both the soul and senses.
Our best defenses are to fly these adders.
O tongues like ladders made to clime dishonor,


Dicus. Dorus you wander far in great reproaches,
So Love encroches on your charmed reason,
But it is season for to end our singing.

In sicke-mans frenzy rather takes compassion,
Then rage for rage: rather my wish I send to thee,
Thou soon may have some help, or change of passion,
She often her looks, the stars her favor bend to thee,

A quiet mind none but thy self can lend to thee,
Thus I commend to thee all our former Love.

Dorus^ Well do I prove, error lies often in zeal,
Yet it is seal, though error, of true heart.
Naught could impart such heates to friendly mind,
But for to find thy words did her disgrace,
Whose only face the little heaven is,

Barred from their chiefest object of delightefulnesse
Thrown on this earth the Chaos of confusions;
As for thy wish, to my enraged spitefulness
The lovely blow, with rare reward, my prayer is
Thou may love her that I may see thy sightfulnesse.

As thou do think) should most of all disquiet me
Without her love, then any mind who fairer is,
Her only cure from surfeit woes can diet me:
She holds the balance of my contentation:

Nay rather then my ease discontentation
Should breed to her^ let me for aye dejected be
From any joy, which might her grief occasion.
With so sweet plagues my happy harms infected be:
Pain wills me die^ yet will of death I mortify:
For though life irkes, in life my loves protected be,
Thus for each change my changelesse heart I fortify.

When they had ended to the good pleasing of the assistants, especially of
Zelmane, who never forgot to give due co^mendatio^s to her friend Dorus,
Basilius called for Lamon to end his discourse of Strephon and Klaius, wherewith
the other day he marked Zelmane to have been exceedingly delighted. But him
sickness had stayed from that Histor and Damon two young shepherds, taking upon
them the two friendly riualles names, to present Basilius with some other of
their complaints Ecloge-wise, and first with this double Sestine.

Strephon. Klaius. Strephon. Ye Goteheard Gods, that love the grassie
mountains,
Ye nymphs that haunt the springs in pleasant valleys,
Ye Satyrs ioyde with free and quiet forests,
Vouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,
Which to my woes give still an early morning.
And draws the dolor on till weary evening.

Klaius. O Mercury, foregoer to the evening,
O heavenly huntresse, of the savage mountains,
O lovely star, entit'led of the morning,
While that my voice does fill these woeful valleys,
Vouchsafe your silent ears to plaining music,
Which often has Echo tir'de in secret forests.

Strephon. I that was once free burges of the forests,
Where shade from Sun, and sports I sought at evening,
I that was once esteemed for pleasant, music,
Am banished now among the monstrous mountains
Of huge despair, and foul afflictions valleys,
Am grown a shrich owl to my self each morning.

Klaius. I that was once delighted every morning,
Hunting the wild inhabiters of forests,
I that was once the music of these valleys,
So darkened am, that all my day is evening,
Heart broken so, that molehilles seem high mountains,
And fill the vales with cries in steed of music.

Strephon. Long since alas, my deadly swannish music
Has made it self a crier of the morning,
And has with wailing strength clim'd highest mountains:
Long since my thoughts more desert be then ^orrests:
Long since I see my joys come to their evening,
And state thrown down to ouertroden valleys.

Klaius. Long since the happy dwellers of these valleys,
Have praide me leave my ^trange exclaming music,
Which troubles their days work, and joys of evening,
Long since I hate the night, more hate the morning:
Long since my thoughts cha^e me like beasts in forests,


Strephon. Me seems I see the high and stately mountains,
Transform themselves to low dejected valleys:
Me seems I hear in these ill changed forests,

Me seems I feel the comfort of the morning
Turnde to the mortal serene of an evening.

Klaius. Me seems I see a filthy clowdie evening,

Me seems I feel a noisome sent, the morning
When I do smell the flowers of these valleys:
Me seems I hear, when I do hear sweet music,
The dreadful cries of murdered men in forests.

Strephon. I wish to fire the trees of all these forests,
I give the Sun a last farewell each evening,
I curse the fidling finders out of music:
With envy I do hate the lofty mountains;

I do detest night, evening, day, and morning.

Klaius. Curse to my self my prayer is, the morning;
My fire is more then can be made with forests;

I wish, no euenings more to see, each evening;
Shamed I hate my self in sight of mountains,
And stop mine ears, lest I grow mad with music.

Strephon. For she whose parts maintainde a perfect music
Whose beauty shin'de more then the blushing morning,
Who much did pass in state the stately mountains,
In streightnes past the Cedars of the forests,
Has cast me wretch into eternal evening,


Klaius. For she, to whom compared, the Alps are valleys,
She, whose lest word brings from the spheres their music,
At whose approach the Sun rose in the evening,
Who where she went bare in her forhead morning,
Is gone, is gone, from these our spoiled forests,
Turning to deserts our best pastur'de mountains.

Strephon. These mountains witness shall, so shall these valleys,
These forests eke, made wretched by our music,

Klaius. Our morning hymn is this, and song at evening.

But, as though all this had been but the taking of a taste of their wailings,
Strephon again began this Dizaine, which was answered unto him in that kind of
verse which is called the crown.

Strephon. Klaius. Strephon. I Joy in grief, and do detest all joys:
Despise delight am tired with thought of ease:
I turn my mind to all forms of annoyes,
And with the change of them my fancy please,
I study that which may me most displease,
And in despite of that displeasures might,
Embrace that most, that most my soul destroys.
Blinded with beams, fell darkness is my sight:
Dwell in my ruins, feed with sucking smarte
I think from me, not from my woes to part.

Klaius. I think from me, not from my woes to part,
And loath this time, called life, nay think, that life
Nature to me for torment did emparte;
Think, my hard haps have blunted deaths sharp knife,
Not sparing me, in whom his works be rife:
And thinking this, think nature, life, and death
Place Sorrows triumph on my conquered heart,
Whereto I yield, and seek none other breath,
But from the sent of some infectious grave:
Nor of my fortune ought, but mischieue crave,

Strephon. Nor of my fortune ought but mischieue crave,
And seek to nourish that, which now contains
All what I am: if I my self will save,
Then must I save, what in me chiefly reigns,
Which is the hateful web of sorrows pains.
Sorrow, then cherish me, for I am sorrow:
No being now, but sorrow I can have:
Then deck me as thine own; thy help I borrowe,
Since thou my riches art, and that thou haste
Enough to make a fertile mind lie waste.

Klaius. Enough to make a fertile mind lie waste,
Is that huge storm, which powers it self on me:

Thunders of cries; lightnings my wild looks be,
The darkened heaven my soul, which naught can see.
The flying sprites which trees by roots up tear,
Be those despaires, which have my hopes quite wast.

But I cannot; who then my self should fly.
So close unto my self my wrackes do lie.

Strephon. So close unto my self my wrackes do lie,

Are all in me: what help then can I try?
My ship, my self, whose course to love does bend,
Sore beaten does her mast of comfort spend:
Her cable, Reason, breaks from anchor, Hope:

Ruin, the wind, has blown her from her scope:
Bruised with waves of Cares, but broken is
On rock, Despair, the burial of my bliss.

Klaius. On rock, Despair, the burial of my bliss,
I long do^ plowe with plough of deep desire:
The seed Fast meaning is, no truth to miss:
I harow it with Thoughts, which all conspire
Favor to make my chief and only hire.

And now I feign would reap, I reap but this
Hatefully grown, Absence new sprongen out.
So that I see, although my sight empaire,
Vain is their pain, who labor in despair.

Strephon. Vain is their pain, who labor in despair.
For so did I, when with my angle Will,
I sought to catch the fish Torpedo fair.
Even then Despair did Hope already kill^

And this has got; the catcher now is caught,
Lamde with the angle, which it self did bear,
And unto death, quite drownde in dolours, brough^
To death, as then disguisd in her fair face.


Klaius. Thus, Thus alas, I had my loss in chase,
When first that crowned Basiliske I knew,
Wose footesteps I with kisses often did trace,
Till by such hap, as I must ever rue,
Mine eyes did light upon her shining hue,
And hers on me, astonished with that sight.
Since then my heart did loose his wonted place,
Infected so with her sweet poisons might,
That, leaving me for dead, to her it went:
But ah her flight has my dead relics spent.

Strephon. But ah her flight has my dead relics spent,
Her flight from me, from me, though dead to me,
Yet living still in her, while her beams lent
Such vital spark, that her mine eyes might see.
But now those living lights absented be,
Full dead before, I now to dust shall fall,
But that eternal pains my soul have hent,
And keep it still within this body thrall:
That thus I must, while in this death I dwell,
In earthly fetters feel a lasting hell.

Klaius. In earthly fetters feel a lasting hell
Alas I do; from which to find release,
I would the earth, I would the heavens sell.
But vain it is to think these pains should cease,
Where life is death, and death cannot breed peace.
O fair, o only fair, from thee alas,
These foul, most foul, desastres to me fell;
Since thou from me (o me) o Sun did pass.
Therefore esteeming all good blessings toys
I joy in grief, and do detest all joys.

Strephon. I joy in grief, and do detest all joys
But now an end, (O Claius) now an end:
For even the herbs our hateful music stroyes,
And from our burning breath the trees do bend.

So well were these wailefull complaints accorded to the passions of all the
princely hearers, while every one made what he heard of another the balance
Geron no more marking then condemning in them, desirous to set forth what
counsels the wisdom of age had laid up in store against such fancies (as
he thought) follies of youth (yet so as it might not apeare that his words
respected them) bending himself to Philisides, (who neither had daunced nor
song with them, and had all this time layne upon the ground at the foot of a
Cypress tree, leaning upon his elbowe with so deep a melancoly that his
senses carried to his mind no delight from any of their objects) he struck him
upon the shoulder, with a right old man's grace, that will seem liuelier then
his age will afford him, And thus began unto him his Ecloge.

Geron. Philisides. Geron. UP, up Philisides, let sorrows go,
Who yelds to woe, does but increase his smart.

But let us sing, sweet tunes do passions ease,
An old man hear, who would thy fancies raise.

Philisides. Who minds to please the mind drowned in annoyes

As well may think with oil to cool the fire:
Or with desire to make such foe a friend,
Who does his soul to endless malice bend.

Geron. Yet sure an end, to each thing time does give,
Though woes now live, at length thy woes must dye.
Then virtue try, if she can work in thee
That which we see in many time has wrought,
And weakest hearts to constant temper brought.

Philisides. Who ever taught a skillesse man to teach,
Or stop a breach, that never Cannon saw?
Sweet virtues law bars not a causefull moan.
Time shall in one my life and sorrows end,


Geron. What can amend where physic is refusde?
The wits abusde with will no counsel take.
Yet for my sake discover us thy grief.

The stars thy state, fortune may change thy hap.

Philisides. If fortunes lap became my dwelling place,
And all the stars conspired to my good,

Ruins relic, cares web, and sorrows food:
Since she fair fierce to such a state me calls,
Whose wit the stars, whose fortune fortune thralls.

Geron. Alas what falls are fallen unto thy mind?
That there where thou confessed thy mischief lies
Thy wit do use still still more harms to find.
Whom wit makes vain, or blinded with his eyes,
What counsel can prevail, or light give light?
Since all his force against himself he tries.
Then each conceit that enters in his sight,
Is made, forsooth, a Iurate of his woes,
Earth, sea, air, fire, heaven, hell, and ghastly sprite.
Then cries to senseless things, which neither knows
What ayleth thee, and if they knew thy mind
Would scorn in man (their king) such feeble show's.
Rebel, Rebel, in golden fetters bind
This tyran Love; or rather do suppress
Those rebel thoughts which are thy slaves by kind.
Let not a glittring name thy fancy dress
In painted clothes, because they call it love.
There is no hate that can thee more oppress.
Begin (and half the work is done) to prove
By rising up, upon thy self to stand.
And thinck she is a she, that does thee move.
He water plowes, and sows in the sand,
And hopes the flickring wind with net to hold,
Who has his hopes laid up in woman's hand.
What man is he that has his freedom sold?
Is he a manlike man, that does not know man
Has power that Sex with bridle to withhold?
A fickle Sex, and true in trust to no man,
A servant Sex, soon proud if they be coi'de
And to conclude thy mistress is a woman.

Philisides. O gods, how long this old soole has annoi'd
My wearied ears! O gods yet grant me this,
That soon the world of his false tongue be void.
O noble age who place their only bliss
In being heard until the hearer dye
Vttring a serpents mind with serpents hiss.
Then who will hear a well autoris'd lie,
(And patience has) let him go learn of him
What swarms of virtues did in his youth fly
Such hearts of brass, wise heads, and garments trim
Were in his days: which heard, one nothing hears,
If from his words the falsehood he do skim.
And herein most their folly vain appears
That since they still allege, When they were young:
It shows they fetch their wit from youthful years
Like beast for sacrifice, where save the tongue
And belly naught is left, such sure is he,
This life-deadman in this old dungeon flong.
Old houses are thrown down for new we see:
The oldest Rams are culled from the flock:
No man does wish his horse should aged be.
The ancient oak well makes a fired block:
Old men themselves, do love young wives to choose:

Who once a white long beard, well handle does,
(As his beard him, not he his beard did bear)
Though cradle witted, must not honor loose.
Oh when will men leave off to judge by hair,

With virtue fraught and full of holy fear!

Geron. If that thy face were hid, or I were blind,
I yet should know a young man speaks now,

He is a beast, that beasts use will allow
For proof of man, who sprung of heavenly fire
Has strongest soul, when most his raynes do bowe^
But fondlings fond, know not your own desire

Fondly blame that to which your selves aspire.
But this light choler that does make you bold,
Rather to wrong then unto just defense,
Is past with me, my blood is waxen cold.

I way them not, but still will thee aduize
How thou from foolish love may purge thy sense.
First think they err, that think them gayly wise,
Who well can set a passion out to show:

Passion bears high when puffing wit does blow,
But is indeed a toy, if not a toy,
True cause of evils, and cause of causeless woe.
If once thou may that fancy gloss destroy

To be a player of thine own annoy.
Then let thy mind with better books be tamed,
Seek to epsy her faults as well as praise,
And let thine eyes to other sports be framed.

Or catch the birds with pitfalls, or with lyme,
Or train the fox that trains so crafty lays.
Ly but to sleep, and in the early prime
Seek skill of herbs in hills, haunt brooks near night,

Go graft again, and seek to graft them right,
Those pleasant plants, those sweet and fruitful trees,
Which both the palate, and the eyes delight.
Cherish the hiues of wisely painful Bees:
Let special care upon thy flock be staid,
Such active mind but seldom passion sees.

Philisides. Has any man heard what this old man said?
Truly not I, who did my thoughts engage,
Where all my pains one look of her has paid.

Geron was even out of countenance, finding the words he thought were so wise,
Mastix, one of the repiningest fellows in the world, and that beheld no body
but with a mind of mislike (saying still the world was amiss, but how it
should be amended, he knew not) sometimes casting his eyes to the ground, even
ashamed to see his gray hairs despised, at last he spied Melampus, and the
younger Laelaps (in deed the jewels he ever had with him) one brawling with
another; which occasion he took to restore himself to his countenance, and
rating Melampus, he began to speak to his dogs, as if in them a man should
find more obedience then in unbridled young men.

Geron. Mastix. Geron. Down, down Melampus; what? your fellow bite?
I set you ore the flock I dearly love,
Them to defend, not with your selves to fight.
Do you not think this will the wolves remove
From former fear, they had of your good minds,
When they shall such divided weakness prove?
What if Laelaps a better morsel find?
Then you erst knew? rather take part with him
Then iarle: lo, lo, even these how envy blindes.
And then Laelaps let not pride make thee brim
Because thou have thy fellow ouergone,
But thank the cause, thou see, where he is dim.
Here Laelaps, here, in deed against the foen
Of my good sheep, thou never trew's time took:
Be as thou art, but be with mine at one.
For though Melampus like a wolf do look,
(For age does make him of a woluish hew)
Yet have I seen when well a wolf he shook.
Fool that I am that with my dogs speak grew.
Come neer^ good Mastix, it is now full tway score
Of years (alas) since I good Mastix knew.
Thou heardst even now a young man snebb me sore,
Because I red him, as I would my son.
Youth will have will: Age must to age therefore.

Masttix. What marvel is in youth such faults be done,
Since that we see our saddest Shepherds out
Who have their lesson so long time begone?
Quickly secure, and easily in doubt,

Or all abroad if but a Cubb start out.
We shepeheards are like them that under sail
Do speak high words, when all the coaste is clear,
Yet to a passenger will bonnet veil.

But commonly like currs we them entreat,
Save when great need of them perforce apeare.
Then him we kiss, whom before we beatt
With such intemperance, that each way grows

And such discordtwixt greatest shepherds flows,
That sport it is to see with how great art
By justice work they their own faults disclose:
Like busy boys, to win their tutors heart,

The third his lesson mist, till all do smarte.
As for the rest, how shepeheardes spend their days,
At blow point, hotcocles, or else at keeles
While, Let us pass our time each shepeheard says.

And does not feel, that life is naught but time
And when that time is paste, death holds his heels.
To age thus do they draw there youthful pryme,
Knowing no more, then what poor trial shows,

This pattern good, unto our children goes,
For what they see, their parents love or hate
Their first caught sense prefers to teachers blows.
These cocklinges cockred we be wail to late,

Women man-wood, and men effeminate.

Geron. Fie man, fie man, what words has thy tongue lent?
Yet thou art mickle warse then ere was I,

We ost are angrier, with the feeble fly
For business, where it pertaines him not,
Then with the poisno'us todes that quiet lie.
I pray thee what has ere the Parret got,

A Cage (gilded perchance) is all his lot.
Who of his tongue the lickowr gladly powrs,
A good fool called with pain, perhapps may be,
But even for that shall suffer mighty Lowers.
Let swannes example siker serve for thee,
Who once all birds, in sweetly-singing past,
But now to silence turned his minstralsie.
For he would sing, but others were defaste;
The peacockes pride, the pyes pild stattery,
Cormoraunts glutt, Kites spoil, king fishers waste.
The Falcons fercenes, Sparrows letchery
The Cockows shame, the Gooses good intent,
Even turtle toutcht he with hypocrisy.
And worse of other more, till by assent
Of all the birds, but namely those were grieved,
Of fowls there called was a parliament.
There was the swan of dignity deprived,
And statute made he never should have voice,
Since when I think he has in silence lived.
I warn thee therefore (since thou may have choice)
Let not thy tongue become a fiery match,
No sword so bytes as that evil tool annoyes.
Let our impartial eyes a little watch
Our own demean, and soon we wondre shall
That huntinge faults, our selves we did not catch.
Into our minds let us a little fall,
And we shall find more spots then Leopards skin.
Then who makes us such judges over all?
But farewell now, thy fault is no great sin,
Come, come my currs, it is late I will go in.

And away with his dogs straight he went as if he would be sure to have the
last word: all the assembly laughing at the lustines of the old fellow who
departed muttering to himself he had seen more in his days then twenty of
them. But Basilius, who never before had heard Philisides (though having
seldom failed to beat these metings) desired him he would begin some Ecloge
with some other of the Philisides though very unwilling, at the Kings
commandment of^red to sing with Thyrsis. But he directly refused him, seeing,
he should within few days be married to the fair Kala; and since he had gotten
his desire he would sing no more. Then the king willed Philisides to declare
the discourse of his own fortunes unknown to them as being a stranger in that
country Basilius someway, he began an Eclogue betwixt himself and the Echo,
framing his voice so in those desert places as what words he would have the
Echo reply unto, those he would sing higher then the rest; and so, kindly
framed a disputation betwixt himself and it, which with these

Philisides. Echo. Fair Rocks, goodly rivers, sweet woods, when shall I see
peace? Peace,

Well met Echo, aproche: then tell me thy will too. I will too.

Tell yet again me the names of these fair formed to do eu'lls. Deu'lls.
Deu'lls? if in hell such deu'lls do a bide, to the hells I do go. Go.
Philisides was commended for the placing of his Echo, but little did he
regard their praises, who had set the foundation of his honor there, where
he was most despisde: and therefore retorning again to the train of his
desolate pensiuenes, Zelmanes seeing no body offer to fill the stage, as if her
long restrained conceates did now burst out of prison: she thus desiring her
voice should be accorded to nothing, Philocleas ears, threw down the burden
of her mind in Anacreous kind of verses.

My muse what ail's this ardour
To blase my only secretts?
Alas it is no glory
To sing my own decaid state.
Alas it is no comfort,
To speak without an answer.
Alas it is no wisdom
To show the wound without cure,
My muse what ail's this ardour?
Mine eyes be dym, my lyms shake,
My voice is hoarse, my throat scerchte,
My tongue to this my roof cleaues,
My fancy amazde, my thought dulled,
My heart does ache, my life faints,
My soul begins to take leave.
So great a passion all feel,
To think a soar so deadly
I should so rashly ripp up.
My muse what ail's this ardour?
If that to sing thou art bent
Go sing the fall of old, Thebes
The wars of ougly Centaurs,
The life, the death of Hector
So may the song be famous,
Or if to love thou art bent,
Rocount the rape of Europe,
Adonis end, Venus nett
The sleepy kiss the moon stale:
So may thy song be pleasant.
My muse what ail's this ardour
To blase my only secretts?
Wherein do only flowrish
The sorry fruits of anguish.
The song thereof a last will,
The tunes be cries, the words plaints,
The singer is the songs theme
When no ear can have joy,
Nor ey receive due object
Ne pleasure here, ne fame get.
My muse what ail's this ardour?
Alas she says I am thine,
So are thy pains my pains too.
Thy heated heart my seat is
Wherein I burn thy breath is
My voice, too hott to keep in,
Besides lo here the auther
Of all thy harms: Lo here she,
That only can redress thee,
Of her I will demand help.
My muse I yield, my muse singe,
But all thy song herein knitt,
The life we lead is all love:
The love we hold is all death,
Nor ought I crave to feed life,
Nor ought I seek to shun death,
But only that my goddess
My life my death do count hers.
Basilius when she had fully ended her song, fell prostrate upon the ground,
and Zelmane never left entreating her till she had (taking a Lyra Basilius
held for her) song these Pha^e^ciakes Reason, tell me thy mind, if here be
reason
In this strange violence, to make resistance.

Of virtues regiment, shining in harness
Of fortunes Diademes, by beauty mustred.
Say then Reason, I say what is thy counsel?

Skowts each motion is, the hands be horsemen,
Her lips are the riches the wars to maintain,
Where well couched abides a coffer of pearl,
Her legs carriage is of all the sweet camp:

Her cannons be her eyes, mine eyes the walls be,
Which at first voly gave too open entry,
Nor ramper did abide; my brain was up blown,

Thus weakened by my self, no help remains
Say then Reason; I say, what is thy counsel?
And now fame the herald of her true honor,

That nature sovereign of earthly dwellers,
Commands all creatures, to yield obeisance
Under this, this her own, her only dearling.
Say then Reason I say what is thy counsel?
Reason sighs but in end he thus does answer.
Naught can reason avail in heavenly matters.
Thus natures Diamond receaues thy conquest,
Thus pure pearl, I do yield, my senses and soul.

Reason look to thy self, I serve a goddess.


Dorus had long he thought kept silence from saying, somewhat which might tend
to the glory of her in whom all glory to his seeming was included, but now
he Asclepiadikes.

O sweet woods the delight of solitarines!
O how much I do like your solitarines!
where man's mind has afreed consideration

Where senses do behold the order of heavenly host,
And wise thoughts do behold what the creator is:
Contemplation here holds his only seat:
Bowndedwith no limitts, borne with a wing of hope
Clymes even unto the stars, Nature is under it.
Naught disturbs thy quiet, all to thy service yields,
Each sight draws on a thought, thought mother of science,
Sweet birds kindly do grant harmony unto thee,
Fair trees shade is enough fortification,
Nor danger to thy self if be not in thy self.
O sweet woods the delight of solitarines!
O how much I do like your solitarines!
Here nor treason is hidd, veiled in innocence,
Nor enuies snaky ey, finds any harbor here,
Nor flatterers venomous insinuations,
Nor coming humorists puddled opinions,
Nor courteous ruin of proffered usury,
Nor time pratled away, cradle of ignorance,
Nor causeless duty, nor comber of arrogance,
Nor trifling title of vanity dazleth us,
Nor golden manacles, stand for a paradise,
Here wrongs name is unheard: slander a monster is
Keep thy sprite from abuse, here no abuse does haunte.
What man grafts in a tree dissimulation?
O sweet woods the delight of solitarines!
O how well I do like your solitarines!
Yet dear soil, if a soul closedin a mansion
As sweet as violetts, fair as lilly is,
Straight as Cedar, a voice stains the Cannary birds,
Whose shade safely does hold, danger auoideth her:
Such wisdom, that in her lives speculation:
Such goodness that in her simplicity triumphs:
Where enuies snaky ey, winketh or else dies,
Slander wants aprelext, flattery gone beyond:
Oh! if such a one have bent, to a lonely life,
Her stepps gladd we receive, gladd we receive her eyes.
And think not she does hurt our solitarines,
For such company decks such solitarines.
The other Shepeheards were offering themselves to have continued the sportes,
but the night had so quietly spent the most part of herself among them that
the Zelmane to her lodging, who would much rather have done the same for
Philoclea, of all sides they went to counterfett a sleep in their bed, for a
true one there agonies could not aforde them. Yet there they Lay (so might
they be most solitary for the food of their thoughts) til it was near noone
the next day, after which Basilius was to continue his Appollo devotions,

The end of the second Eclogues.
THE THIRD BOOK OF THE
THis last days danger, having made Pamalaes love discern, what a loss it
should have suffered, if Dorus had been destroyed, bred such tenderness of
kindness in her toward him: Musidorus; to so far a degree, that in the end
she said, that if she had been the Princes, whom that disguised Prince had
virtuously loved, she would have requited his faith with faithful affection:
finding in her heart, that nothing could so heartily love as virtue: with many mo
words to the same sense of noble favor, Dorus; he was like one frozen with
extremity of cold, ouer-hastilye brought to a great fire, rather oppressed,
then relieved with such a lightning of felicity. But after the strength of
nature had made him able to feel the sweetness of ioyfulnes, that again being
a child of Passion, and never acquainted with mediocrity, could not time (
Mopsa being called away by her mother, and he left alone with Pamela) the
sudden occasion called Love, and that never staide to ask Reasons leave; but
made the too-much loving Dorus take her in his arms, offering to kiss her,
and as it were, to establish a trophee of his victory. But she, as if she had
bin ready to drink a wine of excellent taste and color, which suddenly she
perceived had poison in it, so did she Mopsa, not staying for any answer (which
was no other, but a flood of tears) which she seemed not to mark (much less
to pity) and chid her for having so left her alone.

It was not an amazement, it was not a sorrow, but it was even a death, which
then laid hold of Dorus: which certainly at that instant would have killed him,
but Pamela: he did not tender his own estate, but despised it; greedily
drawing into his mind, all conceits which might more and more torment him.
And so remained he two days in the woods, disdaining to give his body food,
or his mind comfort, Dorus, it should also destroy the image of her that lived
in Dorus: and when the thought of that was crept in unto him, it began to win
of him some compassion to the shrine of that image, and to bewail not for
himself (who^ he hated, but that so notable a love should perish. The^ Pamela
might pardon him the fault, though not the punishment: and the uttermost height
he aspired unto, was, that after his death she might yet pity his error, and
know that it proceeded of love, and not of boldness. That co^ceipt found such
friendship in his thoughts, that at last he yielded since he was banished her
presence, to seek some means by writing to show his sorrow Elegiac as fittest
for mourning: but never pen did more quakingly perform his office; never was
paper more double moistened with ink and Muses more tired tha^ now with changes
and rechanges of his devises: fearing how to end, before he had resolved how to
begin, mistrusting each word, condemning each sentence. This word was not
significant, that word was too plain: this would not be conceived, the other
would be ill conceived. Here Sorrow was not enough expressed; there he seemed
too and putting out better, then he left, he made an end of it; and being
ended, was diverse times ready to tear it: till his reason assuring him, the
more he studied, the worse it grew, he folded it up, devoutly inuoking good
acceptance unto it; and watching his time, when they were all gone one day to
dinner (saving Mopsa) to the other lodge, stale up into Pamelaes chamber, and
in her standish (which first he kissed; and craved of it a safe and friendly
keeping) left it there, to be seen at her next using her ink (himself
returning again to be true prisoner to desperate sorrow) leaving her standish
upon her beds head, to give her the more occasion to mark it: which also fell
out.



Unto a caitife wretch, whom long affliction holds,
and now fully believes help to be quite perished;
Grant yet, grant yet a look, to the last monument of his anguishe,

Dread not a whit (O goodly cruel) that pity may enter
into thy heart by the sight of this Epistle I send^
And so refuse to behold of these strange wounds the recital,
least it might th'allure home to thy self to return,

gratefulnes, sweetness, holy love, hearty regard)
Such thing cannot I seek (Despair has given me my answer
Despair most tragical clause to a deadly request)
Such thing cannot he hope, that knows thy determinat hardness;

Can those eyes that of eyes drowned in most hearty flowing tears,
(tears and tears of a man) had no return to remorse;
Can those eyes now yield to the kind conceit of a sorrow,
which ink only relates, but ne laments, ne replies?

more then Nestors years, more then a Kings diadem.
Ah, that, that do I not conceive; to the heaven when a mouse climes
then may I hope t'atchieue grace of a heavenly tiger.
But, but alas, like a man condemned does crave to be heard speak

But finding th'approch of death with an inly relenting,
gives an adieu to the world, as to his only delight:
Right so my boiling heart, enflam'de with s^re of a fair eye,
bubling out does breath signs of his hugie dolours:
Now that he finds to what end his life, and love be reserved,
and that he thence must part where to live only he lived.
O fair, O fairest, are such thy triumphs to thy fairness?
can death beauty become? must I be such monument?
Must I be only the mark, shall prove that virtue is angry?
shall prove that fiercenes can with a white dove abide?
Shall to the world appear that faith and love be rewarded
with mortal disdain, bent to vnendly revenge?
Unto revenge? O sweet, on a wretch will thou be revenged?
shall such high Plannets tend to the loss of a worm?
And to revenge who do bend, would in that kind be revenged,
as the offense was done, and go beyond if he can.
All my'offence was Love: with Love then must I be chastned,
and with more, by the laws that to revenge do belong.
If that love be a fault, more fault in you to be lovely:
Love never had me oppressed, but that I saw to be loved.
You be the cause that I loud: what Reason blames a shadow,
that with a body 't goes? since by a body it is.
If that Love you did hate, you should your beauty have hidden:
you should those fair eyes have with a veil covered.
But fooole, fool that I am, those eyes would shine from a dark cave.
what veiles then do prevail, but to a more miracle?
Or those golden locks, those locks which lock me to bondage,
torn you should disperse unto the blasts of a wind.
But fool, fool that I am, tho I had but a hair of her head found,
even as I am, so I should unto that hair be a thrall.
Or with fair hands-nailes (o hand which nails me to this death)
you should have your face (since Love is ill) blemished.
O wretch, what do I say? should that fair face be defaced?
should my too-much sight cause so true a Sun to be lost?
First let Cimmerian darkness be my onel'habitacion:
first be mine eyes pulde out, first be my brain perished;
Ere that I should consent to do so excessive a damage
unto the earth, by the hurt of this her heavenly jewel.
O not, but such love you say you could have afoorded,
as might learn Temperance void of a rages events.
O sweet simplicity: from whence should Love be so learned?
unto Cupid that boy shall a Pedante be found?
Well: but faulty I was: Reason to my Passion yielded,
Passion unto my rage, Rage to a hasty revenge.
But what is this for a fault, for which such faith be abolisht,
such says, so staineles, inuiolate, violent?
Shall I not? o may I not thus yet refresh the remembrance,
what sweet joys I had once, and that a place I did hold?
Shall I not once object, that you, you granted a favor
unto the man, whom now such miseries you awarde?
Bend your thoughts to the dear sweet words which then to me given were:
think what a world is now, think who has altered her heart.
What? was I then worthy such good, now worthy such evil?

Did not a rosed breath, from lips more rosy proceeding,
say, that I should well find in what a care I was had?
With much more: now what do I find, but Care to abhor me,
Care that I sink in grief, Care that I live banished?

since so she will, whose will is to me more then a law.
If then a man in most ill case may give you a farewell;
farewell, long farewell, all my woe, all my delight.
What this would have wrought in her, she her self could not tell: for, before
Miso, called her down to entertain Zelmane, who was come to visit the two
sisters; about whom, as about two Poles, the Sky of Beauty was turned: while
Gynecia wearied her bed with her melancholy sickness, and made Misos
shrewdness (who like a sprite, set to keep a treasure, bard Zelmane from any
further conference) Zelmane to such a straight of resolution, either of
impossible granting, or dangerous refusing, as the best escape she had, was
(as much as she could) to avoid their company. So as, this day, being the
fourth day after the uproar, ( Basilius being with his sick wife, conferring
upon such examinations, as Philanax, and other of his noblemen Cecropia with
vehement suspicion of giving either flame or fuel unto it) Zelmane came with
her body, to find her mind, which was gone long before her, and had gotten his
seat in Philoclea: who now with a bashful cheerfulness (as though she were
ashamed, that she could not choose but be glad) joined with her sis^er, in
making much of Zelmane.

Phoebus, ouer-often, and hard, to kiss them. Their countenaunces full of a
graceful gravity; so as the gesture matched with the apparel, it might seem
a wanton modesty, and an entising sobernes. Each of them had an instrument of
music in their hands, which consorting their before they could take the pains
to doubt, much less to ask the question of their quality, the fairest of
them (with a gay, but yet discreet demeanor) in this sort spoke unto them.
Most excellent Ladies, (whose excellencies have power to make cities envy
these woods, and solitarines to be accounted the sweetest company) vouchsafe
our message your gracious hearing, which as it comes from Love, so comes
Arcadia, understanding the often access that certain shepherds of these
quarters, are allowed to have in this forbidden place; and that their rural
sports are not disdained of you, have been stird with emulation to them, and
affection to you, to bring forth some thing, which might as well breed your
contentment: and therefore hoping that the goodness of their intention, Basilius
might be angry withal. But Miso (that had been at none of the pastorals, and
had a great desire to lead her old senses abroad to some pleasure) told them
plainly, they should nor will nor choose, but go thither, and make the honest
country Pamela only casting a seeking look, whether she could see Dorus (who
poor wretch wandered half mad for sorrow in the woods, crying for pardon of
her, who could not hear him) but indeed was grieved for his absence, having
given the Miso went with those six Nymphs, conquering the length of the way
with the force of music, leaving only Mopsa behind, who disgraced weeping
with her countenance, because her mother would not suffer her to show her
newskoured face among the^. But the place appointed (as they thought) met them
half in their way, so well were they pleased Autumn could deliver unto the^.
The maids besought the Ladies to sit down and taste of the swelling grapes,
which seemed great with child of Bacchus: and of

But after the collation was ended, and that they looked for the coming forth
of such devises, as were prepared for them, there rusht out of the woods
twenty armed Zelmane before she could draw her sword, and taking it from her,
put hoods over the heads of all four, and so muffled, by force set them on
horseback and carried them away; the sisters in vain crying for succor,
while Zelmanes heart was rent in pieces with rage of the injury, and disdain
of her fortune. But when they had carried them a Miso with a gagge in her mouth,
and bound hand and foot, so to take her fortune: and brought the three Ladies
(by that time that the Night seemed with her silence to conspire to their
treason) to a castle about ten mile from the Lodges: where they were fain to
take a boat which waited for them. For the castle stood in the midst of a great
lake upon a high rock, where partly by Art, but principally by Nature, it
was by all men esteemed impregnable. Cecropia. But that sight increased the
deadly terror of the Princesses, looking for nothing but death, since they
were in the power of the wicked Cecropia: who yet came unto them, making
courtesy the outside of mischief, and desiring them not to be discomforted:
Philoclea (with a look where Love shined through the miste of Fear) besought
her to be good unto the^, having never deserved evil of her. But Pamelas high
heart disdayning humbleness to injury, Aunt, (said she) what you have
determined of us I pray you do it speedily: for my part I look for no
service, where I find violence.

Cecropia (using no more words with them) conveyed them all three to several
lodgings ( Zelmanes heart so swelling with spite, that she could not bring
forth a word) and so left them: first taking from them their knives, because
they should do themselves no hurt, before she had determined of them: and then
giving such order that they wanted nothing but liberty, and comfort, she went
to her son, who Zelmane, and told him, whom now he had in his power.
Amphialus was but even then returned from far countries, where he had won
immortal fame, both of courage and courtesy, when he met with the Princesses,
and was hurt by Zelmane, so as he was utterly ignorant of all his mothers
wicked devises, to which he would never have consented, being Basilius that now
reigns, having lived unmarried till he was nigh threescore years old (and in
all his speeches affirming, and in all his dooinges assuring, that he never
would marry) made all the eyes of this country to be bent Arcadia, obtained
me of my father the King of Argos, his brother helping to the conclusion,
Argos, nor his daughter would have suffered their Royal blood to be stained
with the base name of subjection. So that I came into this country as apparent
Princess thereof, and accordingly was courted, and followed of all the Ladies
of this country. My port and pomp did well become a King of Argos daughter:
in my presence waited for me, their devotions not being solemnized till I was
ready. Did I walk abroad to see any delight? Nay, my walking was the delight
it self: for to it was the concourse; one thrusting upon another, who might
show him self most diligent and serviceable toward me: my sleeps were
inquired after, and my wakings never unsaluted: the very gate of my house full
of principal persons, who were glad, Basilius; when the heavens (I think
envying my great felicity)

But before, (my son) thou were come to the age to feel the sweetness of
authority, Gynecia, then a young girl, and brought her to sit above me in all
feasts to turn her shoulder to me-warde in all our solemnities. It is
certain, it is not so great a spite to be surmounted by strangers, as by
ones own allies. Think then what my mind was, since withal there is no
question: The fall is greater from the Clinias to stir a notable tumult of
country people: but those loutes were too gross instruments for delicate
conceits. Now lastly, finding Philanax his examinations grow dangerous, I
thought to play double or quit; and with a slight I used of my fine-witted
wench Artesia, with other maids of mine, would have sent Arcadia, to have
pleaded their cause before Pluto, but that ouer-fortunatly for the^, you made
me know the last day how vehemently this childish passion of love, does torment
you. Therefore I have brought them unto you, yet wishing rather hate then love
in you. For Hate often begets victory; Love commonly is the instrument of
subjection. It is true, that I would also by the same practice have entrapped
the parents, but my maids failed of it, not daring to tarry long Basilius will
not long ouer-liue this loss.

O mother (said Amphialus) speak not of doing them hurt, no more the^ to mine
eyes, or my heart, or if I have any thing more dear then eyes, or heart unto me.
Let others find what sweetness they will in ever fearing, because they are ever
feared: for Philoclea accepted for a servant. Well (said Cecropia) I would I
had borne you of my mind, as well as of my body: then should you not have
suncke under these base weaknesses. But since you have tied your thoughts in so
wilful a knot, it is happy my policy has brought matters to such a pass, as
you may both enjoy affection, and upon that build your Amphialus) my heart
would feign yield you thanks for setting me in the way of felicity, but that
fear killes the^ in me, before they are fully borne. For if Philoclea be
displeased, how can I be pleased? if she count it unkindness, shall I give
tokens of kindness? perchance she condemns me of this action, and shall I
triumph? perchance she drownes now the beauties I love with sorrowful tears,
and Cecropia with a fained gravity) I will therefore send her away presently,
that her contentment may be recou^red. No good mother (said Amphialus) since
she is here, I would not for my life constrain presence, but rather would I
die then consent to absence. Pretty intricate follies (said Cecropia) but get
you up, and see how you can prevail with her, while I go to Basilius hap to
besiege us. But remembering herself, she turned back and asked him what he
would have done with Zelmane, since now he might be revenged of his hurt.
Nothing but honorably, answered Amphialus, having deserved no other of me,
especially being (as I hear) greatly cherished of Philoclea: and therefore I
could wish they were Cecropia) company confirms resolutions, and lonelines
breeds a werines of ones thoughts, and so a sooner consenting to reasonable
profers.

But Amphialus (taking of his mother Philocleas knives, which he kept as a
relic, since she had worn the^) gat up, and calling for his richest
apparel, nothing seemed sumptuous enough for his mistresses eyes: and that
which was costly, he feared were

And in that sort he went to Philocleas Chamber: whom he found (because her
Chamber was ouer-lightsome) sitting of that side of her bed which was from
the window; which did cast such a shadow upon her, as a good Painter would
bestow upon Venus, when under the trees she bewailed the murder of Adonis:
her hands and fingers (as it were) indented one within the other: her

But Amphialus that had entrusted his memory with long and forcible speeches,

Alas cousin, (said she) what shall my tongue be able to do, which is
infourmed Zelmane: for I desire no wel-being, without they may be partakers.
With that her tears rayned

But Amphialus was like the poor woman, who loving a tame Do she had, above
all earthly things, having long played withal, and made it feed at her hand
and lap, is constrained at length by famine (all her flock being spent, and
she fallen into extreme poverty) to kill the Dear, to sustain her life.
Many a pitiful Amphialus by a hunger-starued affection, was compelled to offer
this injury, and yet the same affection made him with a tormenting grief,
think unkindness in himself, that he could find in his heart any way to
restrain her freedom. But at length, neither able to grant,

Philoclea fell to so extreme a quaking, and her liuelye whiteness did
degenerate to such a deadly palenesse, that Amphialus feared some dangerous
trance: so that taking her hand, and feelinge that it (which was woonte to be
one of the chief firebrands of Cupid) had all the sense of it wrapped up in
coldness, he began humbly to beseech her to put away all fear, and to assure
Philoclea again to her self, so that slowly lifting up her eyes upon him,
with a countenance ever courteous, but then languishing, she told him, that
he should do well to do so, if indeed he had ever tasted

Amphialus having the cold ashes of Care cast upon the coals of Desire,
leaving some of his mothers Gentlewomen to wait upon Philoclea, himself
indeed a prisoner to his prisoner, and making all his authority to be but a
footestoole to Humblenes, went from her to his mother. To whom with words
which Affection endited, but Amazement uttered, he delivered what had passed
between him and Philoclea: beseeching her to try what her persuasions could
do with her, while he gave order for all such things as were necessary
against such forces, as he looked daily Basilius would bring before his castle.
His mother bad him quiet him

So they calling Clinias, and some other of their counsel, advised upon their
present affairs. First, he dispatched private letters to all those principal
Lords and gentlemen of the country, whom he thought either alliance, or
friendship to himself Argos: but he was as then so ouer-laid with war
himself, as from thence he could attend small succor.

But because he knew how violently rumors do blow the sails of popular
judgments, and how few there be that can discern between truth and
truthlikenes, between shows and substance; he caused a justification of this
his action to be written, whereof were sowed abroad many copies, which with some
glosses of probability, might hide in deed the foulenes of his treason; and
from true commonplaces, Basilius as could be, yet) to set Basilius reigned:
rather then so to hoodwinke himself with affection, as to suffer the realm to
run to manifest ruin. The care w^ereof, did kindly appertain to those who
being subalterne magistrates and officers of the crown, were to be employed as
from the Prince, so for the people; and of all other, especially himself, who
being Philanax, (a man neither in birth comparable to many, nor for his
himself) in so unfit and il-guarded a place, as it was not only dangerous for
their persons, but (if they should be conveyed to any foreign country) to the
whole commonwealth pernicious: that therefore he had brought them into this
strong castle of his, which way, if it might seem strange, they were to
consider, that new necessities Philanax) interpret of it: he protesting, that
whatsoever he should do for his own defense, should be against Philanax, and
no way against Basilius.

To this effect, amplified with arguments and examples, and painted with
rhetorical colors, did he sow abroad many discourses: which as they prevailed
with some of more quick then sound conceit, to run his fortune with him;
so in

But wherein he sharpened his wits to the pearcingest point, was touching his
men (knowing them to be the weapon of weapons, and master-spring (as it were)
which makes all the rest to stir; and that therefore in the Art of man stood
the quintessence, alter an habit in nature. Therefore would he not employ the
still man to a shifting practice, nor the liberal man to be a dispenser of his
victuals, nor the kind-harted man to be a punisher: but would exercise their
virtues in sorts, where they might be profitable, employing his chief care to
know them all particularly, and thoroughly, regarding also the constitution of
their bodies; some being able better to abide Clinias to have care of the
watch, which he knew his own fear would make him very wakefully perform.

The only ods was, that when others took breath, he sighed; and when others
rested, he crossed his arms. For Love passing through the pikes of Danger, and
tumbling it self in the dust of Labor, yet still made him remember his sweet
desire, and beautiful image. Often when he had begun to command one, somewhat
Gorgons head he had been suddenly turned into a stone, so would he there abide
with his eyes planted, Philoclea (with that he would cast up his eyes wherein
some water did appear, as if they would wash themselves against they should
see her) thy heavenly face is my Astronomy; thy sweet virtue, my sweet
Philosophy: let me profit therein, and farewell all other cogitations. But
alas, my mind misgiues me, for your planets bear a contrary aspect unto me.
Woe, woe is me, they threaten (though killing) eyes, shall death head his darte
with the gold of Cupids arrowe? Shall death take his aim from the rest of
Beauty? O beloved (though hating Philoclea, how if thou be merciful, has
cruelty stolen into thee? Or how if thou be cruel, does cruelty look
more beautiful then ever Mercy did? Or

She seeing her sons safety depend thereon, (though her pride much disdained
the name of a desirer) took the charge upon her, not doubting the easy
conquest of an inexpert virgin, who had already with subtlety and impudency
begun Philocleas resolutions by the counterpease of her own youthful
thoughts, which she then called to mind, she doubted not at least to make
Philoclea receive the poison distilled in sweet liquour, which she with little
disguising had drunk up thirstily. Therefore she went softly to Philocleas
chamber, and peeping through the side of the door, then being Philoclea
sitting low upon a cushion, in such a giuen-ouer manner, that one would have
thought, silence, solitariness, and melancholy were come there, under the
ensign of mishap, to conquer delight, and drive him from his natural seat
of beauty: her tears came dropping down like rain in Sunshine, and she not
taking heed to wipe the tears, they hoong upon her cheeks,

Cecropia (stirred with no other pity, but for her son) came in, and haling
kindness Arcadia wish for, and the men long after? Fie of this peevish
sadness; in sooth it is untimely for your age. Look upon your own body, and
see whether it deserve to pine away with sorrow: see whether you will have
these Philoclea) I know not whether my tears become mine eyes, but I am sure
mine eyes thus beteared, become my fortune. Your fortune (said Cecropia) if
you esteem your self a prisoner, and are in truth a mistres: you fear hate,
and shall find love. And truly, I had a thing to say to you, but it is no
matter, since I find you are so obstinatly melancholy, as that you woo his
fellowship: I will spare my pains, and hold my peace: And so stayed indeed,
thinking Philoclea would have had a female inquisitiveness of the matter. But
she, who rather wished to unknow Cecropia) believe me upon the faith of a kings
daughter, you shall be free, so soon as your freedom may be free of mortal
danger, being which greatly needs it. Philoclea looked upon her, and cast down
her eye again. Aunt (said she) I would I could be so much a mistres of my own
mind, as to yield to my cousins virtuous request: for so I construe of it. But
my heart is already set (and staying a while on that word, she brought forth
afterward) to lead a virgins life Cecropia.) A vow, quoth you? no, no, my
dear niece, Nature, when you were first borne, vowed you a woman, and as she
made you child of a mother, so to do your best to be mother of a child: she
gave you beauty to move love; she gave you wit to know love; she gave you an
excellent body to reward Philoclea, fearing least silence would offend for
sullennes) what contentment you speak of: but I am sure the best you can make
of it, (which is marriage) is a burdenous yoke. Ah, dear niece (said Cecropia)
how much you are deceived? A yoke indeed we all bear, laid upon us in our
creation, which by marriage is not increased, but you, who is beloved of others.
Drive not away his affection (sweet Lady) and make no other Lady hereafter
proudly brag, that she has robbed you of so faithful and notable a servant.
Philoclea heard some pieces of her speches, no otherwise then one does when a
tedious pratler combers the hearing of a delightful music. For her thoughts
had left her ears in that captivity, and conveyed themselves to Zelmane: for
whom how well she thought many of those sayings might have been used with a
far more grateful acceptance. Therefore listing not to dispute in a matter
whereof her self was resolved, and desired not to inform the other, she only
told her, that whilst she was so captiued, she could not conceive of any such
persuasions Cecropias persuasions, to have procured freedom.

But neither her witty words in an enemy, nor those words, made more then
Cecropia, no more then her persuasions could win Philoclea to disauowe her
former vow, or to leave the prisoner Zelmane, for the commanding Amphialus.
So that both sides being desirous, and neither graunters, they brake off
conference. Cecropia sucking up more and more spite out of her denial, which
yet for her sons sake, she disguised Amphialus Amphialus. Daily presents, as
it were oblations, to pacify an angry Deity, sent unto her: wherein, if the
workmanship of the form, had striuen with the sumptuousnes of the matter, as
much did the invention in the application, contend to have the chief
excellency: for they were as so many stories of his disgraces, and her
perfections; Amphialus, she translated to Zelmane: the presents seemed so many
tedious clogs of a thralled obligation: and his service, the more diligent it
was, the more it did exprobrate (as she thought) unto her, her unworthy
estate: that even he that did Amphialus affectionately languished, and Cecropia
spitefully cunning, disdained at the barrennes of their success.

Which willingly Cecropia would have revenged, but that she saw, her hurt could
not be divided from her sons mischief: wherefore, she bethought her self to
attempt Pamela, whose beauty being equal, she hoped, if she might be woon^
that her sons thoughts would rather rest on a beautiful gratefulnes, then
still be tormented with a disdaining beauty. Therefore, giving new courage to
her wicked inventions, and using the more industry, because she had mist in
this, and taking Pamela, by her failing in Philoclea, she went to her chamber,
and (according to her own ungracious method of subtle proceeding) stood
listening at the door, because that out of the circumstance of her present
behavior, there might kindly arise a fit beginning of her intended discourse.

And so she might perceive that Pamela did walk up and down, full of deep
Musidorus.

The other part Cecropia might well hear, but this latter prayer for
Musidorus, her heart held it, as so iewel-like a treasure, that it would
scarce trust her own lips withal. But this prayer, sent to heaven, from so
heavenly a creature, with such a fervent Zeal, and the left, of Humbleness,
which Cecropia, if it found not a love of that goodness, yet it felt an
abashment at that goodness; and if she had not a kindly remorse, yet had she an
yrksome accusation of her own naughtines, so that she was put from the biasle
of her fore-intended lesson. For well she found there was no way at that time
to take that mind, but with some, at lest, image of Virtue, and what the figure
thereof was her heart knew not.

Yet did she prodigally spend her uttermost eloquence, leaving no argument
unproven, which might with any force invade her excellent judgment: the
iustnes of the request being, but for marriage; the worthiness of the suitor:
then her own present fortune, which should not only have amendment, but
felicity: besides falsely making her believe, that her sister would think her
self happy, if now she Philoclea in marriage, and so match the next heir
apparent, she being in his power: yet plentifully periuring how extremely her
son loved her, and excusing the little shows he made of it, with the
duetifull respect he bare unto her, and taking upon her self that she
restrained Philoclea, so did she to her, with the tribute of gifts, seek to
bring her mind into servitude: and all other means, that might either
establish a beholdingness, or at lest awake a kindness; doing it so, as by
reason of their imprisonment, one sister knew not how the other was wooed; but
each might think, that only she was sought. Philoclea with sweet and humble
dealing did avoid their assaults, she with the Majesty of Virtue did beat
them of.

But this day their speech was the sooner broken of, by reason that he, who
stood as watch upon the top of the keep, did not only see a great dust arise
(which the earth sent up, as if it would strive to have clouds as well as the
air) but might spy

Only Clinias and Amphialus did exceed the bounds of mediocrity: the one in
his natural coldness of cowardice, the other in heat of courage. For Clinias
(who Basilius, the discord of the nobility, and (when other cause failed him)
the nature of chance served as a cause unto him: and sometimes the hearing
other men speak valiantly, and the quietness of his vnassailed senses, would
make himself display it self unto his eye, and that a dangerous doing must
be the only mean to prevent the danger of suffering, one that had marked him
would have judged, that his eyes would have run into him, and his soul out of
him; so unkindly did either take a sent of danger. He thought the lake was too
shallow, and the walls too

But quite contrarily Amphialus, who before the enemies came was careful,
prouidently

But as if the sight of the enemy had been a Magnes stone to his courage he
could not contain himself, but showing his face to the enemy, and his back
to his soldiers, Philanax, whose face as yet did notbewray Agenor, of all that
army the most beautiful: who having ridden in sportfull conversation among
the foremost, all armed saving that his beauer was up, to have his breath in
more freedom, seeing Amphialus come a pretty way before Amphialus Amphialus
perceiving his youth and beauty, Compassion so rebated the edge of Choler,
that he spared that fair nakedness, and let his staff fall to Agenors
vampalt: so as both with brave breaking should hurtleslie have performed that
match, but that the pitiless lance of Amphialus (angry with being broken)
with an unlucky counterbuffe full of vnsparing splinters, lighted upon that face
far fitter for the combats of Venus; giving not only a sudden, but a foul
death, leaving scarsely any tokens of his former Leontius, a dear friend of
his, who in vain had lamentably cried unto him to stay, when he saw him
begin his careere, it was hard to say, whether pity of the one, or revenge
against the other, held as then the sovereignty in his passions. But while
he directed his eye to Amphialus: who perceiving his il-directed direction
against him, so paid him his debt before it was lent, that he also fell to
the earth only happy that one place, and one time, did finish both their Loves
and lives together.

But by this time there had been a furious meeting of either side: where after
the terrible salutation of warlike noise, the shaking of hands was with sharp
weapons: some lances according to the metal they met, and skill of the
guider, did stain themselves in blood; some flew up in pieces, as if they
would threaten heaven, because they failed on earth^ But their office was
quickly inherited, either by (the Amphialus, who like a Tigre, from whom a
company of Woolues did seek, to ravish a new gotten pray; so he (remembering
they came to take away Philoclea) did labor to make valor, strength, choler
and hatred, to answer the proportion of his love, which was infinite.

There died of his hands the old knight AEschylus, who though by years might
well have been allowed to use rather the exercises of wisdom, then of
courage; yet having a lusty body and a merry heart, he ever took the summons
of Time in jest, or else it had so creepingly stolen upon him, that he had
heard scarcely the noise of his feet, and therefore was as fresh in apparel,
and as forward in enterprises, as a far younger man: but nothing made him
bolder, then a certain prophecy had Amphialus sword was passed through his
throat, he thought himself abused; but that before he died, his son,
indeed seeing his father begin to fall, held him up in his arms, till a
pitilesse soldier of of the other side, with a mace brained him, making father
and son become twins Drialus. Memnon, Nisus and Policrates; the first had
his eyes cut out so, as he could not see to bid the near following death
welcome: the second had met with the same Prophet that old AEschylus had, and
having found many of his speeches true, believed this to, that he should
never be killed, but by his own companions: and therefore no man was more
valiant then Amphialus helped to vnriddle his doubts; for he overthrowing him
from his horse, his own companions coming with a Nisus grasping with
Amphialus, was with a short dagger slain. And for Policrates, while he
shunned as much as he could, keeping only his place for fear of punishment,
Amphialus with a memorable blow struck of his head, where, with the
conuulsions of death setting his spurs to his horse, he gave so brave a
charge upon the enemy, as it grew a proverb, that Policrates was Phebilus
did: for he having long loved Philoclea, though for the meannesse of his
estate he never durst reveal it, now knowing Amphialus, setting the edge of a
rival upon the sword of an enemy, he held strong fight with him. But
Amphialus had already in the daungerousest places disarmed him, and was lifting
up his sword to send him Philoclea (said he) yet this joys me, that I die
for thy sake. The name of Philoclea first stayed his sword, and when he heard
him out, though heabhord him much worse then before, yet could he not vouchsafe
him the honor of dying for Philoclea, but turned his sword another way, doing
him no hurt for overmuch hatred. But what good did that to Phebilus, if
escaping a valiant hand, he was slain by base soldier, who seeing him so
disarmed, thrust him through?

But thus with the well-followed valor of Amphialus were the other almost
overthrown, when Philanax (who was the marshall of the army) came in, with
new force renewing the almost decayed courage of his soldiers. For, crying to
them (and Amphialus followers, as before had done of Philanaxis, they loosing
the ground, as fast as before they had won it, only leaving them to keep it,
who had lost themselves in keeping it. Then those that had killed, inherited
the lot of those that had been killed; and cruel Deaths made them lie quietly
to gether, who most in their lives had sought to disquiet each other; and many
of those first overthrown, had the comfort to see the murderers ouerrun them
to Charons ferrie.

Codrus, Ctesiphon, and Milo, lost their lives upon Philanax his sword: but no
bodies Amphialus, called Ismenus, who never abandoning his master, and making
his tender age aspire to acts of the strongest manhood, in this time that his
side was put to the worst, and that Amphialus-his valor was the only stay of
them from delivering themselves over to a shameful flight, he saw his
masters horse killed under him. Whereupon, asking no advise Amphialus, he came
under the the hand of Philanax: and the youth perceiving he was the man that
did most hurt to his party, (desirous even to change his life sor Philanax
turn toward him; but seeing him so young, and of a most lovely presence, he
rather took pity of him; meaning to make him prisoner, and then to give him to
his brother Agenor to be his companion, because they were not much unlike,
neither in years, nor countenance. But as he looked down upon him with that
thought Leontius by him, even almost under the squiers feet. Then soroing not
only his own sorrow, but the past-comfort sorrow which he fore-knew his mother
would take, (who with many tears, and misgiuing sighs had suffered him to go
with his elder brother Philanax) blotted out all figures of pity out of his
mind, and putting forth his horse (while Ismenus doubled two

Philanax himself could have wished the blow vngiuen, when he saw him fall
like a fair apple, which some discourteous body (breaking his bow) should
throw down before it were ripe. But the case of his brother made him forget
both that, and himself: so as ouerhastily pressing upon the retiring enemies,
he was (ere he Amphialus, Amphialus glad of him, kept head aginst his enemies
while some of his men carried away Philanax.

But Philanax-his men as if with the loss of Philanax they had lost the
fountain of their valor, had their courages so dried up in fear; that they
began to set honor for the vilest. For, taking part with the besiegers, he
made the Amphialians blood serve for a caparison to his horse, and a decking to
his armor. His arm no oftener gave blows, then the blows gave wounds, then
the wounds gave deaths: so terrible was his force, and yet was his quicknes
more forcible then his force, and his Sarpedon, Plistonax, Strophilus, and
Hippolitus, men of great proof in wars, and who had that day undertaken the
guard of Amphialus. But while they sought to save him, they lost the fortresses
that Nature had placed them in. Then Megalus, who was a little before proud,
to see himself stained in the blood of his enemies: but when his own blood
came to be married to theirs, he then felt, that Cruelty does never enjoy a
good cheap glory. After him sent he Palemon, who had that day vowed (with
foolish bravery) to be the death of ten: and nine already he had killed, and
was careful to perform his (almost performed)

And now the often-changing Fortune began also to change the hew of the
battles. For at the first, though it were terrible, yet Terror was decked so
bravely with rich furniture, guilt swords, shining armours, pleasant pensils,
that the eye with delight had scarce leisure to be afraid: But now all
universally defiled with Amphialus his vndismayable courage, nor yet seem
o^gly to him, whose truely-affected mind, did still paint it over with the
beauty of Philoclea. And therefore he, rather enflamed then troubled with the
increase of dangers, and glad Amphialus had more cause to wonder at the
finding, then labor for the seeking: which, if it stirred hate in him, to see
Ceres servant could more cunningly place his flaile: while the left foot
spur set forward his own horse, the right set backward the Amphialus,
always a good Knight, and careful of his charge; who giving a sore wound to
the black Knights thigh, while he thought not of him, with an other blow
slew his horse under him. Amphialus cried to him, that he dishonored him: You
say well (answered the old Knight) to stand now like a private soldier,
setting your credit upon particular fighting, while you may see Basilius with
all his host, is getting between you and your Philocleas Lover. The other
party being sorry for the loss of Philanax, was yet sorrier when the black
Knight could not be found. For he having gotten a horse, whom his dying master
had bequeathed to the Basilius having attempted in vain to bar the safe
return of Amphialus, encamped himself as strongly as he could, while he (to
his grief) might hear the joy was made in the town by his own subjects,
Amphialus (being well beloved of that people) when they saw him not vanquished,
they esteemed him as victorious, his youth setting a flourishing show upon his
worthiness, and his great nobility ennobling his dangers.

But the first thing Amphialus did, being returned, was to visit Philoclea,
and first

NOw was our heavenly vaulte deprived of the light
With Suns depart: and now the darkness of the night
Did light those beamy stars which greater light did dark:
Now each thing that enjoyed that fiery quickening spark
(Which life is called) were moved their spirits to repose,
And wanting use of eyes their eyes began to close:
A silence sweet each where with one consent embraste
(A music sweet to one in careful musing plaste)
And mother Earth, now clad in mourning weeds, did breath
A dull desire to kiss the image of our death:
When I, disgraced wretch, not wretched then, did give
My senses such relief, as they which quiet live,
Whose brains broile not in woes, nor breasts with beatings ache,
With natures praise are wont in safest home to take.
Far from my thoughts was ought, whereto their minds aspire,
Who under courtly pompes do hatch a base desire.
Free all my powers were from those captiuing snares,
Which heavenly purest gifts defile in muddy cares.
Ne could my soul it self accuse of such a fault,
As tender conscience might with furious pangs assaulte^
But like the feeble flower (whose stalk cannot sustain
His weighty top) his top downward does drooping lean:
Or as the silly bird in well acquainted nest

So I in simple course, and vnentangled mind
Did suffer drousie lids mine eyes then clear to blind;
And laying down my head, did natures rule observe,
Which senses up does shut the senses to preserve.

Till deadly sleep at length possessed my living coarse.
A living coarse I lay: but ah, my wakefull mind
(Which made of heavenly stuff no mortal change does blind)
Flew up with freer wings of fleshly bondage free;

Me thought, nay sure I was, I was in fairest wood
Of Samothea land; a land, which whilom stood
An honor to the world, while Honor was their end,
And while their line of years they did in virtue spend.

On Natures sweet repast, as healthful senses ledd.
Her gifts my study was, her beauties were my sport:
My work her works to know, her dwelling my resort.
Those lamps of heavenly fire to fixed motion bound,

What essence dest'nie has; if fortune be or no;
Whence our immortal souls to mortal earth do flow:
What life it is, and how that all these lives do gather,
With outward makers force, or like an inward father.

Then void of nearer cares, the depth of things to find.
When lo with hugest noise (such noise a tower makes
When it blown down with wind a fall of ruin takes)
(Or such a noise it was, as highest thunders send,

The Moon a sunder rent; whereout with sudden fall
(More swift then falcons stoop to feeding Falconers call)
There came a chariot fair by doves and sparrowes guided:
Whose stormelike course staid not till hard by me it bided.

Of heaven, of earth, of hell, of time and place was come.
But straight there issued forth two Ladies (Ladies sure
They seemd to me) on whom did wait a Virgin pure,
Strange were the Ladies weeds; yet more unfit then strange.

Tuckt up even with the knees, with bow and arrows pressed:
Her right arm naked was, discovered was her breast.
But heavy was her pace, and such a meagre cheer,
As little hunting mind (God knows) did there appear.
The other had with art (more then our women know,
As stuff meant for the sale set out to glaring show)
A wanton woman's face, and with curld knots had twinde
Her hair, which by the help of painters cunning, shinde.
When I such guests did see come out of such a house,
The mountains great with child I thought brought forth a mouse.
But walking forth, the first thus to the second said,
Venus come on: said she, Diane you are obaide.
Those names abasht me much, when those great names I hard:
Although their fame (me seemd) from truth had greatly iard.
As I thus musing stood, Diana called to her
The waiting Nymphe, a Nymphe that did excel as far
All things that erst I saw, as orient pearls exceed,
That which their mother hight, or else their silly seed.
Indeed a perfect hew, indeed a sweet consent
Of all those Graces gifts the heavens have ever lent.
And so she was attirde, as one that did not prize
Too much her peerles parts, nor yet could them despise.
But called, she came apace; a pace wherein did move
The band of beauties all, the little world of Love.
And bending humbled eyes (o eyes the Sun of sight)
She waited mistress will: who thus disclosd her spright.
Sweet Mira mine (quoth she) the pleasure of my mind,
In whom of all my rules the perfect proof I find,
To only thee thou see we grant this special grace
Us to attend, in this most private time and place.
Be silent therefore now, and so be silent still
Of that thou see: close up in secret knot thy will.
She answered was with look, and well performed behest:
And Mira I admirde: her shape sonke in my breast.
But thus with irefull eyes, and face that shook with spite
Diana did begin. What moude me to inuit
Your presence (sister dear) first to my Moony sphere,
And hither now, vouchsafe to take with willing ear.
I know full well you know, what discord long has reigned
Betwixt us two; how much that discord foul has stained
Both our estates, while each the other did deprave,
Proof speaks too much to us that feeling trial have.
Our names are quite forgot, our temples are defaced:
Our offerings spoiled, our priests from priesthood are displaced.
Is this the fruit of strife? those thousand churches hie,
Those thousand altars fair now in the dust to lie?
In mortal minds our minds but planets names preserve:
No knees once bowed, forsooth, for them they say we serve.
Are we their servants grown? no doubt a noble stay:
Celestial powers to worms, Jove's children serve to claye.
But such they say we be: this praise our discord bred,
While we for mutual spite, a striving passion fed.
But let us wiser be; and what foul discord brake,

Our years do it require: you see we both do feel
The weakening work of Times for euer-whirling wheel.
Although we be divine, our grandsire Saturn is
With ages force decayed, yet once the heaven was his.
Apollos skill
Our young years to renew (for so he says he will)
Let us a perfect peace between us two resolve:
Which lest the ruinous want of government dissolve,
Let one the Princess be, to her the other yield:

And let her have the gifts that should in both remain:
In her let beauty both, and chastnesse fully reign.
So as if I prevail, you give your gifts to me:
If you, on you I lay what in my office be.

To whom precedence shall of both accorded be.
For that (so that you like) hereby does lie a youth
(She beckned vnto-me) as yet of spotless truth,
Who may this doubt discern: for better, wit, then lot

This crown of amber fair (an amber crown she held)
To worthiest let him give, when both he has beheld:
And be it as he says. Venus was glad to hear
Such proffer made, which she well showd with smiling cheer.
Paris doom
She had chief Goddesses in beauty overcome.
And smirkly thus began say. I never sought debate
Diana dear; my mind to love and not to hate
Was ever apt: but you my pastimes did despise.

Now kindness profred is, none kinder is then I:
And so most ready am this mean of peace to try.
And let him be our judge: the lad does please me well.
Thus both did come to me, and both began to tell

That they by solemn oath their Deities would bind
To stand unto my will: their will they made me know.
I that was first aghast, when first I saw their show:
Now bolder waxt, waxt proud, that I such sway must bear:

And having bound them fast by Styx, they should obaye
To all what I decreed, did thus my verdict say.
How ill both you can rule, well has your discord taught:
Ne yet for ought I see, your beauties merit ought.
To yonder Nymphe therefore (to Mira I did point)
The crown above you both for ever I appoint.
I would have spoken out: but out they both did cry;
Fie, fie, what have we done? ungodly rebel fie.
But now we needs must yield, to that our oaths require.
Yet thou shall not go free (quoth Venus) such a fire
Her beauty kindle shall within thy foolish mind,
That thou full often shall wish thy judging eyes were blind.
Nay then ( Diana said) the chastnesse I will give
In ashes of despair (though burnt) shall make thee live.
Nay thou (said both) shall see such beams shine in her face
That thou shall never dare seek help of wretched case.
And with that cursed curse away to heaven they fled,
First having all their gifts upon fair Mira spread.
The rest I cannot tell, for therewithal I waked
And found with deadly fear that all my sinews shak'd.
Was it a dream? O dream, how have thou wrought in me,
That I things erst unseen should first in dreaming see?
And thou o traitor Sleep, made for to be our rest,
How have thou framde the pain wherewith I am oppressed?
O cowarde Cupid thus do thou thy honor keep,
Vnarmde (alas) vnwarn'd to take a man asleep?
Laying not only the conquests, but the heart of the conqueror at her feet.
*** But she receiving him after her woonted sorrowful (but otherwise unmoved)
manner, it made him think, his good success was but as a pleasant monument of
a doleful burial: Joy it self seeming bitter unto him, since it agreed not
to her taste.

Therefore, still craving his mothers help to persuade her, he himself sent
for Philanax unto him, whom he had not only long hated, but now had his hate
greatly increased by the death of his Squire Ismenus. Besides he had made him
as one of the chief causes that moved him to this rebellion, and therefore
was inclined (to color the better his action, and the more to embrewe the
hands of his accomplices by making them guilty of such a trespass) in some
formal sort to Philanax, only because he was more worthy, then they to be
loved.

But while that deliberation was handeled, according rather to the humor then
the reason of each speaker, Philoclea coming to knowledge of the hard plight
Philanax stood, she desired one of the gentlewomen appointed to wait upon her,
to go in her name, and beseech Amphialus, that if the love of her had any
power of persuasion in his mind, he would lay no further punishment, then
imprisonment, upon Philanax. This message was delivered even as Philanax was
entering to the presence of Amphialus, coming (according to the warning no
harm to him that should die in so good a cause; Amphialus turned quite the
form of his pretended speech, and yielded him humble thanks, that by his
means he had come to that happiness, as to receive a commandment of his
Lady: and therefore he willingly gave him liberty to return in safetye
whether he would, quiting Basilius-his proceeding.

Truly my Lord (answered Philanax) if there were any such known to me,
secret in my masters counsel, as that the revealing thereof might hinder
his good Basilius and Gynecia Zelmane. Sometimes apt to suspect some practice of
Zelmane, because she was a stranger; sometimes doubting some relics of the
late mutiny, which doubt was rather increased, the^ any way satisfied, by
Miso: who (being found, almost dead for hunger, by certain Countrey-people)
brought home word, with what cunning they were trained out, and with what
violence they were carried Amphialus-his own letters sent abroad to procure
co^federates in his attemptes. That Basilius his purpose was never to leave the
sieg of this town, til he had taken it, and reue^ged the injury done unto him.
That he meant rather to win it by time, and famine, then by force of assault:
knowing how valiant men he had to deal withal in the Philanax) let me now,
having received my life by your grace. let me give you your life and and honor
by my counsel; protesting unto you, that I cannot choose but love you, being
my maister-his nephewe; and that I wish you well in all causes but this,
Amphialus, that disdainful choler would feign have made the Philoclea served
for forcible barriers between Anger, and angry effects: so as he said no more,
but that he would not put him to the trouble to give him any further
counsel: But that he might return, if he listed, presently. Philanax glad
to receive an uncorrupted liberty, humbly accepted his favorable conuoy out
of the town; and so departed, not visitinge the Amphialus, and no way
fruitful to them who were no way but by force to be reskued.

The poor Ladies indeed, not suffered either to meet together, or to have
conference with any other, but such as Cecropia had already framed to sing al
their songs to her tune, she herself omitting no day, and catching hold of
every occasion to away. But though the reasons were the same to both, yet the
handling was diverse, according as she saw their humors to prepare a more or
less aptness of apprehension. This day having used long speech to Philoclea,
amplifying not a little the great duetifulnesse her son had showed in
delivering Philanax: of whom she could get no answer, but a silence sealed up
in virtue, and so sweetly graced, as that in one instant Cecropia threatening in
her self to ru^ne a more rugged race with her, went to her sister Pamela: who
that day having wearied her self with reading, and with the height of her heart
disdaining to keep company with any of the Gentlewome^ appointed to attend
her, whom she accounted her iaylours, was working upon a purse certain Roses
and Lillies, as by the finenesse of

The sight whereof so diverse from her sister, (who rather suffered sorrow to
dress it self in her beauty, then that she would bestow any intertainment of
so unwelcome Cecropia take a sudden assuredness of hope, that she should
obtain somewhat of Pamela: thinking (according to the squaring out of her own
good nature) that beauty, carefully set forth, would soon prove a sign of
an vnrefusing harborough. Animated wherewith, she sat down by Pamela: and
taking the purse, and with affected curiosity looking upon the work, Full
happy is Pamela half smiling) I promise you I wrought it, but to make some
tedious hours believe, that I thought Cecropia) of Beauty, to work unwitting
effects of wonder. Truly (said Pamela) I never thought till now, that this
outward glass, entitled Beauty, which it pleases you to lay to my (as I
think) vnguiltie charge, was but a pleasant mixture of natural colors,
delightful to the eye, as music is to the ear, without any further
consequence: since it is a thing, which not only beasts have; but even stones
and trees many of them do greatly excel in it. That other things (answered
Cecropia) Pamela) I fear me you will make me Pygmees, not so much of their
Cranish courage, as because the other Pygmees, and that we see, young babes
think babies of wonderful excellency, and yet the babies are but babies.
But since your elder years, and abler judgment, find Beauty to be worthy of
so incomparable estimation, certainly me thinks it ought to be held in dearnes,
according to the excellency, and (no more then we would do of things which we
account precious) ever to suffer it to be defiled.

Cecropia) Mary God forbid that my speech should tend to any such purpose, as
should deserve so foul a title. My meaning is to join your beauty to love;
your youth to delight. For truly, as colors should be as good as nothing if
there were no eyes to behold them: so is Beauty nothing, without the eye of
Love behold it: and therefore, so far is it from defiling it, that it is the
only honoring of it, any offense unto you, it will not delight it self in
beholding you. There is no effect of his love (answered Pamela) better pleases
me then that: but as I have often answered you, so, resolutely I say unto you,
that he must get my parents consent, and then he shall know further of my
mind; for, without that, I know I should offend God. O sweet youth (said
Cecropia) how untimely subject it is to devotion (No, no Autumn? what lesson is
that unto you, but that in the april of your age, you should be like April? Let
not some of them for whom already the grave gapeth, and perhaps envy the
felicity in you, which themselves cannot enjoy, persuade you to lose the hold
of occasion; while it may not only be taken, but offers, nay sues to be
taken: which if it be not now taken, will Pamela) yet is he my father, and how
beautiful so ever I be, I am his daughter: so as God claims at my hands
obedience, and makes me no judge of his imperfections^

These often replies upon conscience in Pamela; made Cecropia think, that
there was no righter way for her, then as she had (in her opinion) set her in
liking of Beauty, with persuasion not to suffer it to be void of purpose, ^o
if she could make her less feeling of those heavenly conceits, that then she
might easily wind her to her crooked bias. Therefore, employing the uttermost
of her mischievous wit, natural felicity. Be wise, and that wisdom shall be
a God unto thee; be contented, and that is thy heaven: for else to think that
those powers (if there be any such) above are moved either by the eloquence of
our prayers, or in a chafe at the folly of our actions; caries as much reason as
if flies should think, that men take great care

She would have spoken further to have enlarged and confirmed her discourse:
when Pamela (whose cheeks were died in the beautifullest grain of virtuous
anger, with eyes which glistered forth beams of disdain) thus interrupted
her. Peace (wicked woman) peace, unworthy to breath, that do not acknowledge
the breath-giuer;

Lastly Chance is variable, or else it is not to be called Chance: but we see
this many natures conspiring together, as in a popular government to establish
this fair estate; as if the Elementishe and ethereall parts should in their
towne-house set down the bounds of each ones office; then consider what
follows: that there must needs have been a wisdom which made them concur:
for their natures being absolute contrary, in nature rather would have sought
each others ruin, then have

Again, it is as absurd in nature that from an unity many contraries should
proceed

But what madd fury can ever so enueagle any conceipte, as to see our mortal
and corruptible selves to have a reason, and that this universality (whereof
we are but the lest pieces) should be utterly deuoide thereof? as if one
should say, that ones foot might be wise, and him self foolish. This heard
I once alleged against such a godless mind as yours, who being driven to
acknowledge this beastly absurdity his knowledge, no more then the Sun wants
wax to be the fuel of his glorious lightfulnes. This world therefore cannot
otherwise consist but by a mind of Wisdom, which gouernes it, which whether
you will allow to be^ the Creator thereof, as undoubtedly he is, or the soul
and governor thereof, most

Thus she said, thus she ended, with so fair majesty of unconquered virtue,
that captivity might seem to have authority over tyranny: so fowly was the
filthiness Cecropia saw indeed, or else the guilty amazement of a
selfe-accusing conscience, made her eyes untrue judges of their natural
object, that there was a light more then human, which gave a luster to her
perfections. But Cecropia, like a Batte (which though it have eyes to discern
that there is a Sun, yet has manner of a suter: for what majesty of virtue
did in the one, that did silent humbleness in the other. But finding her son
ouer-apt to lay both condemnation, and execution of sorrow upon himself, she
sought to mitigate his mind with feigned delays of comfort, who (having this
inward overthrow in himself) was the more vexed, that he could not utter the
rage thereof upon his outward enemies.

For Basilius taught by the last days trial, what dangerous effects chosen
courages can bring forth, rather used the spade, then the sword; or the
sword, but to defend the spade; girding about the whole town with trenches;
which beginning a good way off from the town, with a number of well directed
Pioners, he still carried before him till they came to a near distance, where
he builded Amphialus make to hinder their working. But they (exercising more
melancholy, then choler in their resolution) made him find, that if by the
advantage of place,

Which every way was a tedious comber to the impacient courage of Amphialus:
till the fame of this war, bringing thither diverse, both strangers, and
subjects, as well of princely, as noble houses, the gallant Phalantus, who
refrained his sportfull delights as then, to serve Basilius, (whom he
honored for received Arcadian manner in marching, encamping, and fighting, and
had learned in what points of government, and obedience their discipline
differed from others, and so had satisfied his mind in the knowledges, both
for the cutting off the enemies helps, and furnishing ones self, which
Basilius orders could deliver unto him, Artesia might see, whom she had so
lightly forsaken: and therefore demanding and obteyning leave of Basilius; he
caused a Heraulde to be furnished with apparel of his office, and tokens of a
Amphialus: who understanding thereof, caused him both safely, and courteously
to be brought into his presence: who making lowly reverence unto him, presented
his Letters, desiring Amphialus that whatsoever they contained, he would
consider that he was only the bearer, and not the inditer. Amphialus with
noble gentleness assured him both, by honorable speeches, and a demeanure
which answered for him, that his revenge, whenever, should sort unto it
self a higher subject. But opening the Letters, he found them to speak in
this manner.

PHalantus of Corinthe, to Amphialus of Arcadia, sends the greeting of a
hatelesse enemy. The liking of martial matters without any mislike of your
person, has brought me rather to the company, then to the mind of your
besiegers: where languishing in idleness, I desire to refresh my mind with
some exercise of arms, which might make known the dooers, with delight of the
beholders. Therefore, if there be any Gentleman in your Town, that either for
the love of

AMphialus read it with cheerful countenance, and thinking but a little with
himself, called for ink and paper, and wrote this answer.

AMphialus of Arcadia, to Phalantus of Corinthe, wishes all his own wishes,
saving

Amphialus showed unto his mother, and some other of his chief Counsailours,
what he had received, and how he had answered: telling them withal, that he
was determined Clinias with falling down at his feet, and beseeching him to
remember, that all their lives depended upon his safety, sought Amphialus
(whose heart was enflamed with courage, and courage enflamed with affection)
made an imperious resolution cut off the tediousness of replies, giving them
in charge, what they should do upon all occasions, and particularly to
deliver the Ladies, if otherwise then well happened unto him: only desiring
his mother, that she would bring Philoclea went to his stable, where himself
chose out a horse, whom (though he was near twenty year old) he preferred
for a piece of sure service, before a great number of younger. His color was of
a brown bay, dapled thick with black spots; his forhead marked with a white
star; to which, in all his body there was no part suitable, but the left
foot before; his mane and tail black, and thick, of goodly, and Torpedo fish.
And so appointed; he caused himself, with his trumpet and squire (whom he had
taken since the death of Ismenus) to be ferried

But there he found Phalantus, already waiting for him upon a horse, milk
white, but that upon his shoulder and withers, he was freckned with red
stains, as when a few strawberies are scattered into a dish of cream. He had
caused his mane and tail to be died in carnation; his reins were vine
branches, which ingendring one The glory, not the pray.

But as soon as Amphialus landed, he sent his squire to Phalantus, to tell
him, that there was the Knight, ready to know whether he had any thing to say to
him. Phalantus answered, that his answer now must be in the language of
lances; and so each attended the warning of the trumpets, which were to sound
at the appointment of four judges, who with consideration of the same, had
divided the ground. Phalantus-his horse young, and feeling the youth of his
master, stood coruetting; which being well governed by Phalantus, gave such a
glittering grace, as when the Sun in a clear day shines upon a wauing water.
Amphialus-horse stood panting upon the ground, with his further foot before, as
if he would for his masters cause begin to make himself angry: till the
trumpet sounding together, Together they delectable sight, in a dangerous
effect; and a pleasant consideration, that there was so perfect agreement, in
so mortal disagreement: like a music, made of cunning discords. But their
horses keeping an even line their masters had skilfully allotted unto them,
passed one by another without encountering, although either might feel Amphialus
was run through the vamplate, and under the arm: so as the staff appearing
behind him, it seemed to the beholders he had been in danger. But he struck
Phalantus just upon the gorget, so as he battred the lamms thereof, and made
his head almost touch the back of his horse. Amphialus Phalantus upon the head,
in such sort, that his feeling sense did both dazell his sight, and astonish
his hearing. But Phalantus (not accustomed to be ungrateful to such benefits)
Amphialus-his horse, leaning hard upon the other, and winning ground, the
other horse feeling himself pressed, began to rise a little Amphialus taking,
set forward his own horse with the further spur, so as Phalantus-his horse
came over with his master under him. Which Amphialus seeing, lighted, with
intention to help Phalantus. But his horse that had faulted, rather with
untimely art, then want of force, gatte up from burdning his burden, so as
Phalantus (in the fall Amphialus near him, he asked him, Whether he had given
him any help in removing his horse. Amphialus said No. Truly said Phalantus, I
asked it, because I would not willingly have fought with him, that had had my
life in his mercy. But now (said Phalantus) before we proceed further, let me
know who you are, Amphialus listing to keep himself unknown, told him he was
a Gentlemen, to whom Amphialus that day had given armor and horse to try his
valor, having never before ben in any combat worthy remembrance. Ah, (said
Phalantus in a rage) And must I be the exercise of your prentis-age? and with
that, choler took away either the bruise, or the Amphialus, as if every blow
would feign have been foremost. But Amphialus (that many like trials had taught,
great spending to leave small remnants) let pass the storm with strong wards,
and nimble auoidings: till seeing his time fit, both for distaunce and
nakedness, he struck him so cruel

But Amphialus, pitying approved valor, made precious by natural courtesy,
went to him, and taking off his headpiece to give him air, the young Knight
(disdaining to buy life with yielding) bad him use his fortune: for he was
resolved never to yield. No more you shall (said Amphialus) if it be not to my
request, that you will account your self to have great interest in me.
Phalantus more overcome by his kindness, then by his fortune, desired yet once
again to know his name, who in his first beginning had showed such fury in
his force, and yet such stay in his surie. Amphialus, then named himself,
telling him withal, he would think his name much bettred, if it might be
honored by the title of his friend. But no Baulme could be more comfortable to
his wound, then the knowledge thereof was to his mind, when he knew his mishap
should be excused by the renowned valor of the other. And so promising each to
other assurednes of good will, Phalantus, (of whom Amphialus Amphialus: but
went to seek his adventures other-where.

As for Amphialus he was received with triumph into the castle; although one
might see by his eyes (humbly lifted up to the window where Philoclea stood)
that Cecropia taking, (who as then stood by Philoclea, and had lately left
Pamela in another room, whence also she might see the combat) Sweet Lady
(said she) now you may see, whether you have cause to love my son, who then
lies under your feet, when he stands upon the neck of his brauest enemies.
Alas said Philoclea, a simple service to me, Cecropia grew so angry with this
unkind answer, that she could not abstain from telling her, that she was
like them that could not sleep, when they were softly laid: but that if her
son would follow her counsel, he should take

Yet (knowing the desperate melancholy of Amphialus in like cases) framed to
him a very thankful message, poudring it with some hope-giuing phrases; which
were of such joy to Amphialus, that he (though against public respect, and
importunity of dissuaders) presently caused it to be made known to the camp,
that Phalantus did, he should in like sort be answered: so as diverse of the
valiantest, partly of themselves, partly at the instigation of Basilius,
attempted the combat with him: and according to every ones humor, so were the
causes of the challenge grounded: one laying treason to his charge; another
preferring himself in the worthiness to serve Philoclea; themselves the lie
for having blasphemed; to the great grief of Basilius, so to see his Rebel
prevail, and in his own sight to crown himself with deserved honor.

Whereupon thirsting for revenge, and else not hoping to prevail, the best of
his camp being already overthrown; he sent a messenger to Argalus, in whose
approved

Argalus at a castle of his own, sitting in a parler with the fair Parthenia,
he reading in a book the stories of Hercules, she by him, as to hear him
read; but while his eyes looked on the book, she looked on his eyes, and
sometimes staying him with some pretty question, not so much to be resolved of
the doubt; as to give him occasion to look upon her. A happy couple,

Parthenia, and as sorry as might be for parting, and yet more sorry for her
sorrow, he gave her the letter to read. She with fearful slownes took it,
and with fearful quickness read it; and having read it, Ah my Argalus (said
she) and have you made such have to answer? and are you so soon resolved to
leave me? But he

Argalus, my Argalus (said she) do not thus forsake me. Remember, alas,
Remember that I shall become of me, if you thus abandon me? Then was it time
for you to follow these adventures, when you adventured no body but your self,
and were no bodies but your own. But now pardon me, that now, or never, I
claim mine own; mine you are, and without me you can undertake no danger: and
will you endanger Parthenia? Parthenia shall be in the battle of your fight:
Parthenia shall smart in your pain Parthenia. Dear Parthenia (said he) this is
the first time, that ever you resisted my will: I thank you for it; but
persevere not in it; and let not the tears of those most beloved eyes be a
presage unto me of that, which you would not should happen. I shall live,
doubt not: for so great a blessing, as you are was not given unto me, so soon
to be deprived of it. Look for me therefore shortly, Amphialus, he thought to
give him some days respite of rest, because he would not have his victory
disgraced by the others weariness. In which days, he sought by all means
(having leave to parley with him) to dissuade him from his enterprise: and then
imparting his mind Basilius, because he found Amphialus was inflexible, wrote
his defy unto him in this manner.

RIght famous Amphialus, if my persuasion in reason, or prayer in good will,
might prevail with you, you should by better means be like to obtain your

To this he quickly received this answer.

MVch more famous Argalus, I whom never threatninges could make afraid, am now
terrified by your noble courtesy. For well I know, from what height of virtue
it does proceed, and what cause I have to doubt such virtue bent to my ruin:
but Love, which justifies the injustice you lay unto me, does also animate me
against all dangers, since I come full of him by whom your self have been
(if I Argalus.

The challenge thus denounced, and accepted, Argalus was armed in a white
armor, which was al gilded over with knots of woman's hair, which came down
a rich jewel) was fastened to the saddle, the tail covered the crooper of the
horse, and the wings served for trappers; which falling of each side, as the
horse stirred, the bird seemed to fly. His petrell and raines, were embrodered
with feathers suitable unto it: upon his right arm he ware a sleeue, which his
dear Parthenia had made for In that sort flourishing. His horse was of a fiery
sorrel, with black feet, and black list on his back, who with open nostrels
breathed war,

But he had scarcely vewed the ground of the Island, and considered the
advantages (if any were) thereof, before the Castle boat had delivered
Amphialus, in all points provided to give a hard entertainmen^. And then
sending each to other their Argalus horse being hot, pressed in with his head:
which Amphialus perceiving, knowing if he gave him his side, it should be to
his disaduauntage, Amphialus was the sooner up; but Argalus had his sword out
the sooner: and then fell they to the cruellest combat, that any present eye
had seen. Their swords first, like Canons, battering down the walls of their
armor, making breaches almost in every place for troops of Argalus gave a
great wound to Amphialus disarmed face; though part of the force of it
Amphialus warded upon his shield, and with-all (first casting his eye up to
Philocleas Window, as if he had fetched his courage thence) feyning to entend
the same sort of blow, turned his sword, and with a mighty reuerse, gave a
cruel wound to the right arm of Argalus, the unfaithful armor Argalus, yet
would he in no action of his confess it: but keeping himself in a lower ward,
stood watching with timely thrustes to repair his loss; which quickly he
did. For Amphialus (following his fawning fortune) laid on so thick upon
Argalus, that his shield had almost fallen peece-meale to the earth, when
Argalus Amphialus had over stricken himself so, as he fell side-ward down, and
with falling saved himself from ruin, The sword by that means slipping
aside, and not pearcing more deeply. Argalus seeing him fall, threatening
Argalus struck with all his might upon his head. But his hurt arm not able to
master so sound a force, let the swoorde fall so, as Amphialus, though
astonished with the blow, could arispe: which Argalus considering, ran in to
grasp with him, and so closed together; falling so to the ground, now one
getting above, and then the other; at length, both weary of so unlovely
embracements, with a dissending consent gate up, and went to their swords: but
happened each of his enemies: where Argalus finding his foes sword garnished
in his blood, his heart raze with the same Amphialus perceiving it, and waying
the small hatefulness of their quarrel, with the worthiness of the Knight,
desired him to take pity of himself. But Argalus,

But then Amphialus forgot all ceremonies, and with cruel blows made more of
his best blood succeed the rest; til his hand being stayed by his ear, his
ear filled with a pitiful cry, the cry guided his sight to an excellent
fair Lady, who came running as fast as she could, and yet because she could
not as fast as she would, she sent her Parthenia, (who had that night dreamed
she saw her husband in such estate, as she then found him, which made her
make such haste thither) they both maruailed. But Parthenia ran between them
(fear of love making her ^orget the fear of Nature) and then fell down at
their feet, determining so to part them, Amphialus, My Lord (said she) it is
said you love; Argalus. Amphialus was about to have answered, when Argalus,
vexed with his Fortune, but most vexed that she should see him in that
fortune, Ah Parthenia (said he) Argalus live but by request? Is that a life?
With that he went aside, for fear of hurting her, and would have begun the
co^bate afresh. But Amphialus not only co^iured by that which held the
Monarchy of his mind, but even in his noble heart melting with compassion at so
passionate a sight, desired him to withhold his hands, for that he should
Argalus not so much striving with Amphialus (for if he had had him in the like
sort, in like sort he would have dealt with him) as laboring against his
own power (which he chiefly despised) set himself forward, stretching his
strength to the uttermost. But the fire of that strife, blown with his inward
rage, boiled out his blood in such abundance, that he was driven to rest him
upon the pommel of his sword: and then each thing beginning to turn round in
the dance of Death before his eyes, his sight both dazzled Parthenia, and
Amphialus both hastily went unto him: Amphialus took off his helmet, and
Parthenia laid his head in her lap, tearing of her linen sleues and partlet,
to serve about his wounds to bind which, she took of her hair-lace, and
would have cut of her fair hair herself, but that the squires and judges
came in with fitter things for the purpose:

O Parthenia, no more Parthenia (said she) What art thou? what see thou? how
is thy bliss in a moment fallen? how art thou, euen-now before all Ladies the
example Argalus, Argalus, I will follow thee, I will follow thee.

Argalus came out of his sown, and lifting up his languishing eyes (which a
paineful rest, and iron sleep did seek to lock up) seeing her, in whom (even
dying) he lived, and him self seated in so beloved a place, it seemed a little
cheerful blood came up to his cheeks, like a burning cole, almost dead, if
some breath a little revive it: and forcing up (the best he could) his feeble
voice, My Parthenia, and I persuade my self, it will increase the blessedness
of my soul, so to see thee. Love well the remembrance of thy loving, and
truly loving, Argalus: and let not (with that word he sighed) this disgrace of
mine, make thee one day think, thou had an unworthy husband. They could
scarcely understand the last words: for Parthenia make answer, so full was
her breast of anguish. But while the other sought to stanch his remediles
wounds, she with her kisses made him happy: for his last breath was delivered
into her mouth.

But when indeed she found his ghost was gone, then Sorrow lost the wit of
Argalus was gone; till Amphialus (so ^^oued with pity of that sight, as that
he honored his adversaries death with ^^^es) caused her (with the help of
her women that came with her partly by ^^rce, to be conveyed into the boat,
with the dead body of Argalus, from Ba^^^^us him self, with all the funeral
pomp of military discipline, trayling all their ^^^ignes upon the ground,
making these warlike instruments sound doleful notes, and Basilius (with
comfort in his mouth, and woe in his face) sought to persuade some ease into
Parthenias mind: but all was as easefull to her, as the handling of sore
wounds: all the honor done, being to her but the triumph of her ruin, she
finding no comfort, but in desperate yielding to Sorrow: and rather determined
to hate her self, if ever she should find ease thereof. And well might she
Amphialus-his fame: to whom yet (such was his case) that Trophe upon Trophe,
still did but build up the monument of his thraldom; he Philoclea, that she
was most absent, when he was present with her; and ever sorriest, when he had
best success: which would have made him renounce all comfort, but that his
mother, with diversity of devises, kept up his heart.

But while he allayed thus his outward glory, with inward discomfort, he was

Among other that attended Basilius in this expedition, Damaetas was one;
whether to be present with him, or absent from Miso: once, certain it was
without any mind to make his sword cursed by any widow. Now being in the camp,
while each talk Amphialus, it fell out sometimes in communication, that as the
speech of heaven does often beget the mention of hell, so the admirable prowes
of Amphialus (by a contrary) brought forth the remembrance of the cowardice of
Clinias: in so much, as it grew almost to a proverb, As very a cowarde, as
Clinias. Describing him in such sort, that in the end, Damaetas began to
think with himself, that if he made a challenge unto him, he would never
answer it; and that then he should greatly increase the favorable conceit
of B^silius. This fancy of his he uttered to a young Gentleman, that waited
upon Philanax, in whose friendship he had especial confidence, because he
haunted his company, laughing often merely at his speeches, and not a little
extolling the dotes of Mopsa. The young Gentleman as glad, as if he had found
a Hare sitting, egd him on, breaking the matter with Philanax, and then (for
fear the humor should quayle in him) wrote a challenge him self for
Damaetas, and brought it to him. But when Damaetas read it, putting his head on
his shoulder, and somewhat smiling; he said, it was pretty indeed; but that it
had not a lofty style enough: and

O Clinias, thou Clinias, the wickedest worm that ever went upon two legs;
the very fritter of fraud, and seething pot of iniquity: I Damaetas, chief
governor of all the royal cattle, and also of Pamela (whom thy Master most
perniciously ^ath sug^^sted out of my dominion)

The young Gentleman seemed dumbe-striken with admiration, and presently
Basilius (every body helping on, to ease his mind o^^rcharged with melancholy)
he went into the town according to the manner before time used, and in the
presence of Amphialus delivered this letter to Clinias; desiring to have an
answer, which might be fit for his reputation. Clinias opened it, read it; and
in the reading, his blood not da^ing to be in so dangerous a place, went out
Amphialus, perceauing the matter, took him aside, and very earnestly dealt
with him not to shame himself; Amphialus Philoclea, but not being able to
persuade with him, Amphialus licenced the Gentleman, telling him, that by next
morning he should have answer.

The young Gentleman (sorry he had sped no better) returned to Damaetas, who had
fetched many a sower-breathed sigh, for fear Clinias would accept the
challenge. Damaetas began to speak his loud voice, to look big, to march up
and down, and in his march to lift his legs higher then he was wont, swearing
by no mean devotions, that the walls should not keep the coward from him, but
he would fetch him out of his connie-berrie: and then was Pamela. To this
purpose many willing hands were about him, letting him have reins, pettrell,
with the rest of the furniture, and very brave bases; but all coming from
diverse houses, nether in color nor fashion, showing any kindred one with
another; but that liked Damaetas Miso would not take it well at his return, if
Miso mine own pigsnie, thou shall hear news of Damaetas.


Thus all things being condignely ordered, with an ill favored impatiencie he
waited, until the next morning, that he might make a muster of him self in
the Clinias, should fet his runaway feet upon the face of the earth?

But as he was by diverse principal young Gentlemen, to his no small glory,
lifted up on horseback, comes me a page of Amphialus, who with humble smiling
reverence Clinias: whom Amphialus had brought to this, first with persuasions
(that for certain, if he did accept the combat, Damaetas would never dare to
appear, and that then the honor should be his) but (...) (...) and then
willed him to lie down upon the earth as flat as he could. Clinias obeyed; and
Damaetas (who never could think himself safe, till Clinias were dead) began
to think with himself, that if he struck at him with his sword, if he did
not kill him at the first blow, that then Clinias might hap to arise, and
revenge himself. Therefore he thought best to kneel down upon him, and with
a great Clinias lay with so sheepish a quietness, as if he would have been glad
to have his throat cut for fear of more pain, the Judges came in, and took
Damaetas from off Damaetas was loath to consent, till they swear, they would
not suffer him to fight any more, when he was up: and then more forced, then
persuaded, he let him rise, crowing over him, and warning him to take heed how
he dealt any more with any that came of his fathers kindred. But thus this
combat of being finished, Damaetas was with much mirth and melody received
into the camp as victorious, never a Page there failing to wait upon this
Triumph.

But Clinias, though he wanted heart to prevent shame, yet he wanted not wit to
feel shame; not so much repining at it for the abhorring of shame, as for the
discommodities, that to them that are shamed, ensue. For well he deemed, it
would Clinias (finding himself the scorning-stocke of every company) fell
with repining to hate the cause thereof; and hate in a cowards heart, could set
it self no other limits, but death. Which purpose was well egged on by
representing unto himself, what danger he lately was in; Amphialus, then ever
before, yet a leering eye upon the one side at him, a countenance still framed
to smiling before him (how little cause soever there was Amphialus did submit
himself into, made Clinias assuredly look for his overthrow, and for his own
consequently, if he did not redeem his former treason to Basilius, with a more
treasonable falsehood toward Amphialus. His chief care therefore was, to find
out among all sorts of the Amphialians, whom either like fear, tediousnes of
the siege, or coffeehouse of some unsatisfied Artesia, sister to the late
slain Ismenus, and the chief of the six maids, who had trained out the
Princesses to their banquet of misery: so much Cecropia; who assured her that
the two princesses should be made away; and then Amphialus would marry her:
which she was the apter to believe, by some false persuasio^ her glass had given
her of her own incomparable excelle^cies, and by the great favor she knew he
bare to her brother Ismenus, which (like a self-flattering woman) she conceived
was Amphialus much more then ordinary favor, nor her ouer-large offering
herself to a mind otherwise owed, had obtained a loked-for acceptatio^;
disdain to be disdained spite of a frustrat hope, Philanax, nor revenged upon
Philanax. But all these coals were well blown by the company she especially
kept with Zelmane, all this time of her imprisonment. For finding her presence
vncheerfull to the mourning Philoclea, Pamela, she spent her time most with
Zelmane. Who though at the first hardly brooking the instrument of their
misery, learning cunning in the school of adversity, in time framed her self
to yield her acceptable intertainment. For Zelmane, when she had by that
unexpected mischief her body imprisoned, her valor ouermastred, her wit
beguiled, her desires barred, her love eclipsed; Philocleas misfortune, and not
able to succor her, she was a great while, before the greatness of her heart
could descend to sorrow, but rather rose boiling up in spite and disdain;
Reason hardly making Courage believe, that it was distressed: but as if the
walls would be afraid of her, so would her looks shoot out threatening upon
them. But the fetters of servitude Philoclea graued in the glass windows, and
by the foolish idolatry of affection, no sooner written, then adored; and no
sooner adored, then pitied: all the wonted praises (she was wont to give unto
her) being now but figures of rethorick to amplify the injuries of misfortune;
against which being alone, she would often make inuectiue

But when Artesia did insinuat herself into her acquaintance, she gave the
government of her courage to wit, and was content to familiarize herself with
her: so much the rather, as that she perceived in her certain flawes of
il-concealed discontentme^t. Insomuch that when Zelmane would sweeten her mouth
with the praises of Artesia that she had been abused to abuse so worthy persons:
Artesia (though falsely) would protest, that she had bin beguiled in it, never
meaning other matter the^ recreatio^: and yet withal (by Zelmane (using her
own bias to bowl near the mistres of her own thoughts) was content to lend
her belief, and withal, to magnify her desert, if willingly she would
deliver, whom unwillingly she had imprisoned; leaving no argument which might
tickle ambition, or flatter revenge. So that Artesia, (pusht ^orward by
Clinias, and drawn on ward by Zelmane) bound her self to that practice;
wherein Zelmane (for her part) desired no more, but to have armor and weapons
brought into her chamber, not

But Clinias (whose faith could never comprehend the mysteries of Courage)
persuaded Artesia, while he by corruption had drawn the guard of one gate, to
open it (when he would appoint the time) to the enemy: that she should
impoyson Amphialus, which she might the easier do, because she her self had
used to make the broaths, when Amphialus (either wearied or wounded) did use
such diet. And all things already were ready to be put in execution, when they
thought best to break the matter with the two excellent sisters, not doubting
of their consent in a thing so behoofefull to themselves: their reasons being,
that the Princesses knowing their Clinias (even so) could scarcely be
sufficiently certain: and withal, making them privy to their action, to
bind them afterward to a promised gratefulnes toward them. They went
therefore at one time, when they knew them to be alone, Clinias to Philoclea,
and Artesia to Pamela: and Clinias, with no few words, Philoclea (in whose
clear mind treason could find no hiding place) told him, that she would be
glad, if he could persuade her cousin to deliver her, and that she would never
forget his service therein: but that she desired him to lay down any such way
of mischief, for that (for her part) she would rather yield to perpetual
imprisonment, then consent Clinias, so that he had no other remedy in his
mind, but to kneel down to Philoclea, and beseech her to keep it secret,
considering that the intention was for her service: and vowing (since she
misliked it) to proceed no further therein. She comforted him with promise of
silence, which she

But that little auayled: for Artesia having in like sort opened this device to
Pamela, she (in whose mind Virtue governed with the scepter of Knowledge)
hating so horrible a wickedness, and straight judging what was fit to do,
Wicked woman (said she) whose vnrepenting heart can find no way to amend
treason, but Cecropia heard the noise; who was (sooner then Artesia imagined
she would) come up, to Pamela to a window, where she might see a notable
skirmish happened in the Camp, as she thought, among themselves: and being a
cunning fisher in troubled waters, straight found by their voices and gestures,
there was some matter of consequence, which she desired Pamela to tell her.
Ask of her (said Pamela) and learn to know, that who do falshoode to their
superiors, teach falshoode to their inferiors. Cecropia taking away the
each-way guilty Artesia, with fear of torture, gat of her the whole practice:
so as Zelmane was the more closely imprisoned, and Clinias (with the rest of
his corrupted mates, according to their merits) executed: For, as for Artesia,
she was but locked up in her chamber, Amphialus not consenting (for the love
he bare to Ismenus) that further punishment should be laid upon her.

Anaxius, nephewe to the Giant Euardes whom Pyrocles slew: A Prince, of body
exceedingly strong; in arms so skillful and fortunate, as no man was thought
to excel him; of courage that knew not how to fear: parts worthy praise,
if they had not been guyded by pride, and followed by injustice. For by a
strange composition of mind, Thraso-like boasting, and yet (so unlucky a
lodging his virtues had gotten) he would never boast more then he would
accomplish: Amphialus, but Mars had been so impartial an arbiter, that neither
side gate advantage of the other. But in the end it happened, that Anaxius found
Amphialus (unknown) in a great danger, and saved his Pyrocles to be revenged
of his uncles death) hearing of this siege, never taking pains to examine
Basilius, that Philanax, with well governed speed made such head against him,
as would have showed, how soon Courage falls in the ditch which has not the
eye of Wisdom: but that Amphialus at the same time issued out, and Basilius
had builded, made way for his friend Anaxius with great loss of both sides,
but especially of the Basilians; such notable monuments had those two swords
especially left of their Masters redoubted worthynesse.

There with the respect fit to his estate, the honor dew to his worthiness,
and Amphialus enforce him self (as much as in a besieged town he could) to
make Anaxius know, that his succor was not so needful, as his presence
grateful. For causing the streets and houses of the town to witness his
welcome (making both soldiers and Magistrates in their countenaunces to show
their gladness of him) Anaxius, speaking alowde, looking upon his brothers) I
am only sorry there are not half a dozen Kings more about you: that what
Anaxius can do, might be the better manifested. His brothers smiled, as though
he had ouer-modestly spoken far underneath the pitch of his power. The^ was
he disarmed at the earnest request of Amphialus: for Anaxius boiled with desire
to issue out upon the enemies, persuading himself, that the Sun should not be
set, before Amphialus asked him, whether he would visit the young Princesses.
But Anaxius whispered him in the ear: In truth (said he) dear friend
Amphialus, though I am none of those, that love to speak of themselves, I
never came yet in company of Ladies, but that they fell in love with me. And I
that in my heart scorn them as a peevish paltrie sex, not worthy Amphialus
could have been angry with him for those words; but knowing his humor
suffered him to dance to his own music: and gave himself to entertain
both him and his brothers, with as cheerful a manner, as could issue from a
mind whom Anaxius he yielded the direction of all. He gave the watchwoorde, and
if any grace were granted, the means were to be made to Anaxius. And that
night when supper was ended, wherein Amphialus would needs himself wait
upon him, he caused in Boats upon the Lake an excellent music to be ordered:
which, though Anaxius might conceive was for his Philoclea.

The music was of Cornets, whereof one aunswering the other, with a sweet
emulation, striving for the glory of music, and striking upon the smooth
face of the quiet Lake, was then delivered up to the castle walls, which with
a proud re^erberation,

THe Fire to see my wrongs for anger burns:
The Air in rain for my affliction weepeth:
The Sea to ebb for grief his flowing turns:
The Earth with pity dull his center keeps
Fame is with wonder blazed:
Time runs away for sorrow:
Place stands still amazed,
To see my night of evils, which has no morrow.
Alas all only she no pity takes
To know my miseries, but chaste and cruel
My fall her glory makes;
Yet still her eyes give to my flames their fuel.
Fire, burn me quite till sense of burning leave me:
Air, let me draw thy breath no more in anguish:
Sea, drowned in thee of tedious life bereave me:
Earth, take this earth wherein my spirits languish.

Time, have my dying hour:
Place, see my grave vptorne:
Fire, air, sea, earth, fame, time, place show your power.
Alas from all their helps I am exiled:

Fie Death thou art beguiled:
Though I be hers, she makes of me no treasure.
But Anaxius (seeming a weary before it was ended) told Amphialus, that for
Anaxius. Amphialus, who had no whit less courage, though nothing blown up
with pride, willingly condiscended Amphialus at Anaxius earnest request,
staying within the town to see it guarded, Anaxius and his brethren, Lycurgus,
and Zoilus, sallied out with the best chosen men. But Basilius (having been the
last day some what unprovided) now had better fortified the overthrown sconse;
and so well had prepared every thing for defense, that it was Anaxius beyond
the credit of the credulous. For thrife (valiantly followed by his brothers)
did he set up his banner upon the rampire of the enemy: though thrice again
by the multitude, and advantage of the place, but especially by the coming of
three valiant Knights, he were driven down again. Numbers there were that
Anaxius: but the rest, by the length of time and injury of Historians, have
been wrapped up in dark forgetfulness: only Tressennius is spoken of,
because when all abandoned the place, he only made head to Anaxius; till
having lost one of his legs, yet not lost the heart of fighting, Lycurgus
(second brother to Anaxius) cruelly murdered Anaxius him self disdayning any
further to deal with him.

But so far had Anaxius at the third time prevailed, that now the Basilians
began to let their courage descend to their feet, Basilius, and Philanax in
vain striving with reverence of authority to bridle the flight of
astonishment, and to teach Fear discretion: so that Amphialus, seeing Victory
show such a flattering countenance to

But that fancy altered quickly by the sudden coming to the other side of
three Knights, whereof the one was in white armor, the other in green, and
the third by his black armor; and device straight known to be the notable
Knight, who the first day had given Fortune so short a stop with his notable
deeds and Amphialus. Fonthe very cowardes no sooner saw him, but as borrowing
some of his spirit, they went like young Eagles to the pray, under the wing of
their damme. For the three adventurers, not content (...) (...) on. For her
exceeding fair eyes, having with continual weeping gotten a little redness
about them; her roundy sweetly swelling lips a little trembling, as though
they kissed their neighbor death; in her cheeks the whiteness striving by
little and little to get upon the rosines of the^; her neck, a neck indeed of
Alablaster, displaying the wound, which with most dainty blood labored to
drown his own beauties; Amphialus was astonished with grief, compassion, and
shame, detesting his fortune, that made him unfortunate in victory.

Therefore, putting off his headpeece and gauntlet; kneeling down unto her,
and with tears testifying his sorrow, he offered his (by himself accursed)
hands to help her: protesting his life and power to be ready to do her
honor. But Parthenia Argalus made no such bargain with you, that the hands
which killed him, should help me. I have of them (and I do not only pardon
you, but thank you for it) the service which I desired. There rests nothing
now, but that I go live with him, since whose death I have done nothing but
die. Then pawsing, and a little fainting, and again coming to herself, O
sweet life, Argalus. I come, my Argalus, I come: And, O God hide my faults in
thy mercies, and grant (as I feel thou do grant) that in thy eternal
love, we may love Atropos cut off her sentence: for with that, casting up both
eyes and hands to the skies, the noble soul departed (one might well assure
himself) to heaven, which left the body in so heavenly a demeanure.

But Amphialus (with a heart oppressed with grief, because of her request)
withdrewe Amphialus perceauing it, by force held her. Others that had as strong
passion, though weaker resolution, fell to cast dust upon their heads, to
tear their garments: al falling upon the earth and crying upon their sweet
mistres; as if their cries could persuade the soul to leave the celestial
happiness, to come again into the elements of sorrow: one time calling to
remembrance her virtue, chastnes, sweetness, they having been deceived by her
words, who as^ured the^, that it was revealed unto her, that she should have
her hearts desire in the battle against Amphialus, which they wrongly
understood. Then kissing her cold hands and feet, weary of the world, since
she was gone, who was their world. The very heavens seemed, with Basilius
himself came forth, and brought the fair Gynecia with him, who was come into
the camp under color of visiting her husband, and hearing of her daughters:
but indeed Zelmane was the Saint, to which her pilgrimage was intended:
cursing, envying, blessing, and in her heart kissing the walls which imprisoned
her. But both they with Philanax, and the rest of the principal Nobility,
Basilius himself would needs lend his shoulder) to a Church a mile from the
Camp, where the valiant Argalus lay intombed; recommending to that sepulcher,
the blessed relics of faithful and virtuous Love: giving order for the
making of marble images, to represent them, and each way enriching Basilius
himself caused this Epitaph to be written.

The Epitaph.
HIs being was in her alone:
And he not being, she was none.
They ioi'd one joy, one grief they grieved,

The hand was one, one was the sword
That did his death, her death afford.
As all the rest, so now the stone
That tombs the two, is justly one.
ARGALVS and PARTHENIA.
Then with eyes full of tears, and mouths full of her praises, returned they
to the camp, with more and more hate against Amphialus: who (poor Gentleman)
had therefore greater portion of woe, then any of them. For that courteous
heart, which would have grieved but to have heard the like adventure, was rent
with remembering pieces (which afterward he had good cause to repent) saying,
that neither it was worthy to serve the noble exercise of chivalry, nor any
other worthy to feel that sword, which had stricken so excellent a Lady: and
withal, banishing all cheerfulnes of his countenance, he returned home. Where
he gate him to his bed, not so much to rest his restles mind, as to avoid all
company, the sight whereof was tedious unto Philoxenus and Parthenia, Philoclea:
to whom he had so governed himself, as one that could neither conquer, nor
yield; being of the one side a slave, and of the other a iaylor: and with all,
almost vpbrayding unto his mother the little success of her large hoping
promises, he in effect Philoclea nothing mollified, and now himself so cast
down, as he thought him unworthy of better. But his mother (as she had
plentiful cause) making him see, that of his other griefs there was little or
no fault in himself, and therefore there ought to be little or no grief in him;
when she came to the head of the sore, indeed seeing that she could no longer
patch up her former promises (he taking Amphialus) how well I thought my fortune
would bring forth this end of your labors? assure yourself, mother, I will
sooner pull out these eyes, then they shall look upon the heavenly Philoclea,
but as upon a heaven, whence they have their light, and to which they are
subject, if they will power down Our will and pleasure?

Tush, tush son (said Cecropia) if you say you love, but withal you fear;
you fear lest you should offend; offend? and how know you, that you should
offend? because she does deny: deny? Now by my truth, if your sadness would
let me laugh, I could laugh heartily, to see that yet you are ignorant, that No,

Theseus should ever have gotten Antiope with sighing, and crossing his arms?
he ravished her, and ravished her that was an Amazon, and therefore had gotten a
habit of stoutnes above the nature of a woman; but having ravished her, he got
a child of her. And I say no more, but that (they say) is not gotten without
consent of both Iole had her own father killed by Hercules, and her self
ravished, by force ravished, and yet ere long this ravished, and vnfathered
Lady could sportfully put on the Lions skin upon her own fair shoulders, and
play with the clubbe with her own delicate hands: so easily had she pardoned
the rauisher, that she could not but delight in those weapons of rauishing. But
above all, mark Helen daughter Jupiter, who could never brook her
manerly-wooing Menclaus, but disdained his humblenes, and lothed his softnes.
But so well she could like the force of enforcing Paris, that for him she could
abide what might be abidden. But what? Menelaus takes heart, he recouers her by
force, by force carries her home, by force inioies her; and she, who could
never like him for serviceableness, ever aft^r loved Amphialus) and assure thy
self, that though she refuses, she refuses but to endeere the obtaining. If
she weep, and chide, and protest, before it be gotten, she can but weep, and
chide, and protest, Amphialus, know thy self a man, and show thy self a man:
and (believe me upon my word) a woman is a woman.

Amphialus was about to answer her, when a Gentleman of his made him
understand, that there was a messenger come, who had brought a letter unto him

TO thee Amphialus of Arcadia, the forsaken Knight wishes health, and courage,
that by my hand thou may receive punishment for thy treason, according to
thine own offer, which wickedly occasioned, thou have proudly begun, and
accursedly mainteyned. I will presently (if thy mind faint thee not for his
own guiltiness) meet thee in thy Island, in such order, as has by the former
been used: or if thou likest not the time, place, or weapon, I am

Amphialus read it, and with a deep sigh (according to the humor of inward

FOrsaken Knight, though your namelesse challenge might carry in it self
excuse for a man of my birth and estate, yet herein set your heart at rest, you
shall not be forsaken. I will without stay answer you in the woonted manner,
and come both armed in your foolish threatenings, and yet the more fearelesse,
expecting weak blows, where I find so s^rong words. You shall not therefore
long attend me in the Island, before proof teach you, that of my life you have

This being written, and delivered, the messenger told him, that his Lord
would (if he liked the same) bring two Knights with him to be his Patrons.
Which Amphialus accepted, and withal shaking off (with resolution) his mothers
importunate only was barrd from or, From whose I am, bannished. In his creste
he carried Philocleas knives, the only token of her forced favor.

So past he over into the Island, taking with him the two brothers of Anaxius;
where he found the forsaken Knight, attired in his own liuerie, as black, as
sorrow it self could see it self in the blackest glass: his ornaments of
the same hew, Impresa was a Catoblepta which so long lies dead, as the Moon
(whereto it has so natural a sympathy) wants her light. The word signified
that The Moon wanted not the light, but the poor beast wanted the Moons
light. He had in his headpiece, a whippe, to witness a selfe-punishing
repentance. Their very horses were cole-blacke too, not having so much as one
star to give light to their night of blackenesse: so as one would have
thought they had been the two sons

Which aliance of passions so moved Amphialus (already tender-minded by the
afflictions of Love) that without staff or sword drawn, he trotted fairly to
the forsaken Knight, willing to have put off this combat, to which his
melancholy heart Amphialus) upon that quarrel: for I confess the same too: but
it proceeds from their own beauty, to enforce Love to offer this force. I
maintain then (said the forsaken Knight) that thou art not worthy so to love.
And that confess I too (said Amphialus) since the world is not so richly
blessed, as to bring forth any thing worthy thereof. But no more unworthy then
any other, since in none can be a more

But Amphialus by that thinking (though wrongly, each indeed mistaking other)
that he was his rival, forgot all mind of reconciliation, and having all his
thoughts bound up in choler, never staying either judge, trumpet, or his own
lance, drew Vulcan, when he wrought at his more courteous wives request,
AEnaeas an armor, made not his hammer beget a greater sound, then the swords
of those noble Knights did, they needed no fire to their forge, for they made
the fire to shine at the meeting of their swords, and armours, each side
fetching still new spirit from the Cupid) would show themselves no less
forward, then the other dustie band of Mars, to make themselves notable in the
notablenes of this combat. Of either side Confidence, unacquainted with Loss,
but assured trust to overcome, and good experience how to overcome: now
seconding their terrible blows with cunning laboring the horses, to win
ground of the enemy; now unlooked for parting one from the other, to win
advantage Amphialus, that he resolved to see a quick end: and therefore with
the violence of courage, adding strength to his blow, he struck in such wise
upon the side of the others head, that his remembrance left that battered
lodging: so as he was quite from himself, casting his arms abroad, and ready
to fall Amphialus used the favor of occasion, redoubling his blows: but the
horse (weary to be beaten, as well as the master) carried his master away, til
he came unto himself: But then who could have seen him, might well have
discerned shame in his cheeks, and revenge in his eyes: so as setting
Amphialus, reaching out his arm, which had gathered up the sword, meaning with
that blow to have cleaued Amphialus in two. But Amphialus seeing the blow
coming, shunned it with nimble turning his horse aside; wherewith the forsaken
Knight ouer-strake himself so, as almost he came down with his own strength.
But the more hungry Amphialus, that his horse with the force of the shocke
rose up before, almost ouerturned: which Amphialus perceauing, with rain and
spur put forth his horse; and withal gave a mighty blow in the descent of
his horse, upon the shoulder Amphialus excused himself, for having (against
his will) killed his horse. Excuse thy self for viler faults (answered the
forsaken Knight) and Amphialus) shall not make me forget my self: and
therewith (trotting a little aside) alighted from his horse, because he would
not have fortune come to claim any part of the victory. Which courteous act
would have mollified the noble heart of the forsaken Knight, if any other had
done it, ran unto him, re-entring into as cruel a fight, as eye did ever
see, or thought could reasonably imagine; far beyond the reach of weak words
to be able to express it. For what they had done on horseback, was but as a
morsel to keep their stomakes in appetite, in comparison of that, which now
(being themselves) they Amphialus being the taller man, for the most part stood
with his right leg before; his shield at the vtterm ost length of Amphialus
attempted: his eye guided his foot, and his foot conueighed Amphialus put
knee to the ground, without any humblenes. But when he felt himself stricken
down, and saw himself stricken down by his rival, then shame seemed one
arm,

Amphialus to himself) am I Amphialus, before whom so many monsters and
Gyantes have fallen dead, when I only sought causeless adventures? and can one
Knight now withstand me in the presence of Philoclea, and fighting for
Philoclea? or since I lost my liberty, have I lost my courag? have I gotten the
heart of a slave, as well as the fortu^e? If an army were against me in the
sight of Philoclea, could it resist Amphialus? have not passions killed him, and
wretched I (I know not how) succeeded into his place? Of the other side the
forsaken Knight with no less spite, fell out with himself; Have thou broken
(said he to himself) the commandment of thy only Princess to come now
into her presence, and in her presence to prove thy self a coward? Does Asia
and Egypt set up Trophes unto thee, to be matched here by a traitor? O noble
Barsanes, how shamed will thy soul be, that he that slew thee, should be
resisted by this one man? O incomparable Pyrocles, more grieved will thou be
with thy friends shame, then with thine own imprisonment, when thou shall know
how little I have been able to do for the delivery of thee, and those
heavenly Princesses. Am I worthy Musidorus, worthy for nothing, but to keep
sheep, get thee a sheephooke again, since thou can use a sword no better.

So was the forsaken Knight (laid upon clokes) carried home to the camp. But
his two friends knowing his earnest desire not to be known, covering him from
any bodies eyes, conveyed him to their own tente: Basilius himself conquering
his earnest desire to see him, with fear to displease him, who had fought so
notably in his quarrel. But Fame set the honor upon his back, which he would
not suffer to Pamela, though he had done beyond all others Basilius and all the
camp very sorry for the parting of these three unknown Knights, in whose
prowess they had reposed greatest trust of victory.

But they being gone, Basilius and Philanax gave good order to the strengthening
of the siege, fortifying themselves, so as they feared no more any such
sudden onset, Anaxius. And they within (by reason of Anaxius hurt, but
especially of Amphialus-is) gave themselves only to diligent watch and ward,
making no sallies out, but committing the principal trust to Zoilus and
Lycurgus. For Anaxius was yet forced to keep his chamber. And as for
Amphialus, his body had such wounds, and he gave such wounds to his mind; as
easily it could not be determined, whether Amphialus, (would he say to him
self) how dare thou entitle thy self the lover of Philoclea, that have
neither showed thy self a faithful coward, nor a valiant rebel, but both
rebellious and cowardly, which no law Philoclea, I had died, before thy eyes
had seen my weakness: and then perchance with some sigh thou would have
confessed, thou had lost a worthy servant. But now, caitife that I am, what
ever I have done, serves but to build up would fortify the gestures with
such effects of fury, as sometimes offering to tear up his wounds, sometimes
to refuse the sustenance of meat, and counsel of physicians, that his
perplexed mother was driven to make him by force to be tended, with extreme
corsey to her self, and annoiance to him: till in the end he was contented

His mother, who had confined all her love only unto him, set only such about
him, as were absolutely at her commandment, whom she forbad to let him know
any thing that passed in the castle, till his wounds were cured, but as she
from time to time should instruct them: she (for her self) being resolved,
now Basilius, that if he did not presently raise his siege, she would cause
the heads of the three Ladies, prisoners, to be cut off before his Zelmane to
be led unto the walls, where she had made a scaffold, easy to be seen by
Basilius: and there caused them to be kept, as ready for the slaughter, till
answer came from Basilius. A sight full of pity it was, to see those three
(all excelling in all those excellencies, wherewith Nature can beautify Pamela
giving sweetness to majesty, Philoclea enriching noblenes with humblenes,
Zelmane setting in womanly beauty manlike valor) to be thus subjected to the
basest injury of unjust Fortune. One might see in Pamela a willingness to dye,
rather then to have life at others discretion, though sometimes a princely
disdain would sparkle out of her Princely eyes, that it should Philoclea a
pretty fear came up, to endamaske her rosy cheeks: but it was such a fear,
as rather seemed a kindly child to her innate humblenes, then any other
dismayednes: or if she were dismayed, it was more for Zelmane, then for her
self; or if more for her self, it was because Zelmane should loose her. As
for Zelmane, as she went with her hands Amphialus-his succession (whereon they
were dependents) some, and the greatest some, doing because others

But when this message was brought to Basilius, and that this pitiful
preparation was a sufficient letter of credit for him to believe it, he called
unto him his chief councelors: among which, those he chiefly trusted were
Philanax and Kalander (lately come to the camp at Basilius commandment, and
in him self weary of his solitary life, wanting his sons presence, and never
having heard from his beloved guestes since they parted from him). Now in this
doubt what he should do, he willed Kalander to Amphialus, but left that to
bring in at another consultation. But Basilius made sign to Philanax, who
standing a while in a maze as inwardly perplexed, at last thus delivered his
opinion.

If ever I could wish my faith untried, and my counsel vntrusted, it should be
at this Kalander had come in good time when you first took arms, before all
Amphialus-his ambition, draw their factious friends about them: but if it be
for their security only, the same cause will bring forth the same effect: and
for their security they will preserve them. But it may be said, no man knows
what desperate folks will do: it is true, and as true that no reason nor policy
can prevent what desperate folks will do: and therefore they Only let it suffice
to take away their despair, which may be by granting pardon for what is past;
so as the Ladies may be freely delivered. And let them that are your subjects,
trust you that are their Prince: do not you subject your self to trust them,
who are so untrusty as to be manifest traitors. For if they find you so
base-minded, as by their threatening In sum, you are a Prince, and a father of a
people, who ought with the eye of wisdom, the hand of

He would have proceeded on, when Gynecia came running in amazed for her
daughter Pamela, but mad for Zelmane: and falling at Basilius feet, besought
him to make no delay: using such gestures of compassion in steed of stopped
words, that Basilius, otherwise enough tender minded, easily granted to raise
the siege, which he saw dangerous to his daughters: but indeed more careful
for Zelmane, by whose besieged person, the poor old man was straightly
besieged: so as to rid him of the famine of his mind, he went in speed away,
discharging his soldiers: only leaving the authority, as before, in Philanaxis
hands, he himself went with Gynecia to a Zelmane, whom he called the poor
stranger, as though only Law of hospitality moved him, and for that purpose
sent diverse messengers to traffic with Cecropia.

But she by this means rid of the present danger of the siege (desiring
Zoilus and Lycurgus to take the care, till their brother recovered, of
reuictualling, and furnishing Basilius, without he would grant his daughter in
marriage to her son, which by no means he would be brought unto) bent all the
sharpness of her malicious wit, how to bring a comfortable grant to her
son, whereupon she well found no less then his life depended. Philoclea, so
much did she to Pamela, though in manner sometimes differing, as she found fit
to level at the ones noble height, Philoclea, yet seeing the equal gifts in
Pamela, she hoped, a fair grant would recover the sorrow of a fair refusal:
cruelly entending the present impoysoning the one, as soon as the others
affection were purchased.

But in vain was all her vain oratory employed. Pamelaes determination was
built upon so brave a Rock, that no shot of hers could reach unto it: and
Philoclea (though humbly seated) was so environed with sweet rivers of clear
virtue, as could neither be battred, nor undermined: her witty perswasio^s had
wise answers; Cecropia in nature violent; cruel, because ambitious; hateful,
for old rooted grudge to their mother, and now spiteful because she could not
prevail with girls, as she counted them; lastly, drawn on by her love to her
Cecropia still sweetning her fiercenesses with fair promises, if they would
promise fair; that feeling evil, and seeing a way far better, their minds
might the sooner

She resolving all extremities, rather then fail of conquest, pursued on her
rugged way: letting no day pass, without new and new perplexing the poor
Ladies minds, and troubling their bodies: and still swelling, the more she was
stopped, Philoclea, as if so many Kites should come about a white Dove, and
matching violent gestures with mischievous Dianas temple) fell to scourge that
most beautiful body: Love in vain holding the shield of Beauty against her
blind cruelty. The Son drew clouds up to hide his face from so pitiful a
sight; and the very stone walls did yield drops of sweat for agony of such a
mischief: each senseless thing had sense of pity; only they Cupid told his
weeping mother, that he was sorry he was not deaf, as well as blind, that he
might never know so lamentable a work. Philoclea, with tearefull eyes, and
sobbing breast (as soon as her wearines rather then compassion, gave her
respite) kneeled down to Cecropia, and making once take away her life, and not
please her self with the tormenting of a poor Gentlewoman. If (said she) the
common course of humanity cannot move you, nor the having me in your own
walls, cannot claim pity: nor womanly mercy, nor near alliance, nor
remembrance (how miserable so ever now) that I am a Cecropias fury: so that
(excellent creature) she was newly again tormented by those hellish monsters:
Cecropia using no other words, but that she was a proud and ungrateful wench:
and that she Zelmane was a prisoner: who therein only was short of the bottom
of misery, that she knew not how unworthily her Angel, by these devils was
abused: but wanted (God wot) no stings of grief, when those words did but
strike upon her heart, that Philoclea was a captive, and she not able to succor
her. For well she knew the confidence Philoclea had in her, and well she knew,
Philoclea Philoclea rested her mind, that she knew she should die beloved of
Zelmane, and should die, rather then be false to Zelmane. And so this most
dainty Nimphe, easing the pain of her mind with thinking of another pain;
and almost forgetting the pain of her body, through the pain of her mind,
she wasted, even longing for the conclusion of

But for a while she was unvisited, Cecropia employing her time in using the
like cruelty upon Pamela, her heart growing not only to desire the fruit of
punishing them, but even to delight in the punishing them. But if ever the
beams of perfection shined through the clouds of affliction, if ever Virtue
took a body to Pamela. For when Reason taught her there was no resistance,
(for to just resistance first her heart was inclined) then with so heavenly a
quietness, and so graceful a calmenes, did she suffer the diverse kinds of
torments they used to her, that while they vexed her fair body, it seemed,
that she rather directed, then obeyed the vexation. And Cecropia ended, and
asked whether her heart would yield: she a little smiled, but such a smiling
as showed no love, and yet could not but be lovely. And then, Beastly woman
(said she) follow on, do what thou will, and can upon me: for I know thy
power is not unlimited. Thou may well wrack this silly body, but me thou
can never overthrow. For my part, I will not do the^ the pleasure to desire
death of thee: but assure thy self, both my life and death, shall triumph with
honor, laying shame upon thy detestable tyranny.

And so, in effect, conquering their doing with her suffering, while Cecropia
tried Pamela remained almost as much content with trial in her self, what
virtue could do, as grieved with the misery wherein she found her self
plunged: only sometimes her thoughts softened in her, when with open wings they
flew to Musidorus. Musidorus would take this her misery; and she, that wept
not for herself, wept yet Musidorus tears, which he would weep for her. For
gentle Love did easlier yield to lamentation, then the constancy of virtue
would else admit. Then would she remember the case wherein she had left her
poor shepherd, and she that wished death for her Musidorus (would she say)
and let my name live in thy mouth; in thy heart my Pamela. Then would she wish
to her self, that no other woman might ever possess his heart: and yet
scarcely the wish was made a wish, when her self would find fault with it, as
being too unjust, that so excellent a man should be banished from the comfort
of life. Then would she fortify her resolution, with bethinking the worst,

So these diamonds of the world whom Nature had made to be preciously set in
the eyes of men, to be the chief works of her workmanship, the chief
ornaments of the world, and Princesses of felicity, by rebellious injury were
brought to the uttermost distres that an enemies heart could wish, or a woman's
spite invent: Cecropia daily in one or other sort punishing them, still with
her evil torments giving them fear of worse, making the fear it self the
sorest torment of all; that in the end weary of their bodies, they should be
content to bestow them at her appointment. But as in labor, the more one does
exercise it, the more by the doing one is enhabled to do; strength growing
upon the work, so as what at Cecropia found her self still farther off: for
where at first she might perchance have persuaded them to have visited her
son, and have given him some comfort in his sickness, drawing near to the
confines of Deaths kingdom, now they protested, that they would never
otherwise speak to him, then as to the enemy, of most unjust cruelty toward
them, that any time or place could ever

This made the poison swell in her cankred breast, perceiving that (as in water)
the more she grasped the less she held: but yet now having run so long the way
of rigor, it was too late in reason, and too contrary to her passion, to
return to a course of meekness. And therefore (taking counsel of one of her
old associates who so far excelled in wickedness, as that she had not only
lost all feeling of conscience,

This being concluded, Cecropia went to Philoclea, and told her, that now she
was to come to the last part of the play: for her part, though she found her
hard hearted obstinacy such, that neither the sweetness of loving means, nor
the force of hard Philocleas mind, that entered so far, as this: for where to
all pains and dangers of her self, foresight with (his Lieutenant
Resolution) had made ready defense; now with the love she bare her sister, she
was driven to a stay, before she determined: but long she stayed not, before
this reason did shine unto her, that since in herself she preferred death
before such a Amphialus, and so shall you not only justly punish me (who
indeed do hate both you and your son) but, if that may move you, you shall
do more virtuously in preserving one most worthy of life, and killing an other
most desirous of death: lastly in winning her, in steed of a peevish unhappy
creature, that I am, you shall bless your son with the most excellent woman
Cecropia, (who had already set down to her self what she would do) with
bitter both terms, and countenance, told her, that she should not need to
woo death ouer-egerly: ^or if her sister going before her did not teach her
wit, her self should quickly follow. For since they were not to be gotten,
there was no way for her sons quiet, but to know, that they were past
getting. And so since no entreating, nor threatening might prevail, she bad her
prepare her eyes for a new play, which she should see within few hours in the
hall of that castle.

A place indeed ouerfit for so unfit a matter: for being so stately made that
the bottom of it being even with the ground, the roof reached as hie as any
part of the castle, at either end it had convenient lodgings. In the one end
was (one story from the ground) Philocleas abode, in the other of even height,
Pamelas, and Zelmanes in a chamber above her: but all so vaulted of strong, and
thickly built Zelmane, and of Philoclea: a sufficient challenge to call their
eyes to defend themselves in such an encounter. And by and by came in at one
end of the hall, with about a dozen armed soldiers a Lady, led by a couple,
with her hands bound before her: from above her eyes to her lips muffled
with a fair kerchiefe, but from her mouth to the shoulders all Zelmane, nor
Philoclea needed to be told who she was: for the apparel she ware made them
too well assured, that it was the admirable Pamela. Whereunto the rare
whiteness of her naked neck gave sufficient testimony to their astonnished
senses. But the fair Lady being come to the Philoclea, poor soul, earnestly
listened, according to her speech even minding to frame her mind, her heart
never till then almost wavering to save her sisters life) before the
unfortunate Lady could pronounce three words, the executioner cut off the

And this was done so in an instant, that the very act did ouerrun Philocleas
sorrow (sorrow not being able so quickly to thunderbolt her heart thorough her
senses, but first only oppressed her with a storm of amazement) but when her
eyes saw that they did see, as condemning themselves to have seen it, they
became weary of their own power of seeing: and her soul then drinking up woe
with Pamela my sister, my sister Pamela, woe is me for thee, I would I had died
for thee. Pamela never more good in me, but that I did ever love thee, and ever
will lament thee. Let this day be noted of all virtuous folks for most
unfortunate: let it never be mentioned, but among curses; and cursed be they
that did this mischief, and most accursed be mine eyes that beheld it.
Sweet Pamela; that head is stricken of, where only wisdom Pamela how haste
thou left me to all wretchedness, and misery? Yet while thou liuedst, in
thee I breathed, of thee I hoped. O Pamela, how much did I for thy excellency
honor thee, more then my mother, and love thee more then my self? Never more
shall I lie with thee: never more shall we bathe in the Pamela is dead; and
live I? O my God, And with that she fell again in a soune, so as it was a
great while before they could bring her to her self again; but being come to
her-selfe, Alas (said she) unkind women, since you have given me so many
deaths, torment me not now with life: for Gods sake Pamela, whom ever I sought
to follow. Alas Pamela, they will not let me come to thee. But if they keep
promise, I shall tread thine own steps after thee. For to what am I borne
(miserable soul) but to be most unhappy in my self, and yet more unhappy in
others? But o that a thousand more miseries had chanced unto me, so thou
had Pamela, my sister Pamela. And so, like lamentable Philomela complained
she the horrible wrong done to her sister, which if it stird not in the
wickedly closed minds of her tormentors, a pity of her sorrow, yet bredde it
a weariness of her sorrow: so as only leaving one to prevent any harm ^he
should do her self, the rest went away, consulting again with Cecropia, how
to make profit of this their late

In the end, that woman that used most to keep company with Zelmane, told
Cecropia, that she found by many most sensible proofs in Zelmane, that there
was never woman so loved another, as she loved Philoclea: which was the cause
that she (further then the commandment of Cecropia) had caused Zelmanes
curtains to be Philoclea had, she might stand in the greater fear for her,
whom she loved so well: and that indeed she had hit the needle in that devise:
for never saw she creature so astonished as Zelmane, exceedingly sorry for
Pamela, but exceedingly exceeding that exceedingnes in fear for Philoclea.
Therefore her advice was, she ^houlde cause Zelmane to come and speak with
Philoclea. For there being such vehemency of friendship between them, it was
most likely both to move Zelmane to persuade, and Philoclea to be persuaded,
Cecropia liked well of the counsel, and gave order to the same woman to go
deal therein with Zelmane, and to assure her with oath, that Cecropia was
determined Philoclea should pass the same way that Pamela had done, without
she did yield to satisfy the extremity Zelmane think Amphialus a fit match
for Philoclea.

But Zelmane (who had from time to time understood the cruel dealing they had
used to the sisters, and now had her own eyes wounded with the sight of ones
death) still would cry out, that it could not be, Philoclea should be in so
miserable estate, and she not relieve her: and so while she haled her wit to
her courage, she drew it from his own limits. But now Philocleas death (a
word able to marshall ^ll his thoughts in order) being come to so short a
point either with small delay to be suffered, or by the giving her self to
another to be prevented, she was driven to think, Philocleas death: for once
the thought could not enter into his heart, nor the breath issue out of his
mouth, which could consent to Philocleas death for any bargain. Then how to
prevent the next degree to death (which was her being possessed by another) was
the point of his minds labor: and in that he found no other way, but that
Philoclea should pretend Cecropias request; and so by speaking with Amphialus,
and making fair (but delaying) promises, procure liberty for Zelmane; who
only wished but to come by a sword, not doubting then to destroy them all, and
deliver Philoclea: so little did both the men, and their forces seem in her
eyes, looking down upon them from the hye top of affections tower.

With that mind therefore (but first well bound) she was brought to
Philoclea, having already plotted out in her conceit, how she would deal with
her: and so came she with heart and eyes, which did each sacrifice either to
Love upon the altar of Sorrow: and there had she the pleasing displeasing
sight of Philoclea: Philoclea, who^ already the extreme sense of sorrow had
brought to a dullness therein, her face Zelmane was set down by her, and the
women gone away (because she might be the better persuaded when no body was by,
that had heard her say she would not be persuaded) then began first the eyes
to speak, Zelmane brake silence, but spoke with the only eloquence of
amazement: for all her long methodized oratione was inherited only by such
kind of speeches. Dear Lady, in extreme necessities we must not. But alas
unfortunate wretch that I am, that I live to see this day. Philoclea that had
alredie dyed in Pamela, and of the other side had the heaviness of her heart
something quickened in the most beloved sight of Zelmane, ghessed somewhat at
Zelmanes mind; and therefore spoke unto her in this sort. Pyrocles (said she)
I know this exceeding comfort of your presence, is not brought unto me for
any good will that is owned unto me: but (as I suppose to make you persuade me
to save my life with the ransom of mine honor: although no body should be
so unfit a pleader in that cause, as your self, yet perchance you would have
me live. Your honor? God forbid (said Zelmane) that ever, for senses would
give me leave, I would feign have persuaded you.

To what purpose my Pyrocles? (said Philoclea) of a miserable time what gain
is there? has Pamelaes example wrought no more in me? is a captive life so
much worth? can ever it go out of these lips, that I love any other but
Pyrocles? shall my Pyrocles? And why should I do all this? to live? O Pamela,
sister Pamela, why should I live? only for thy sake Pyrocles I would live:
but to thee I know too well I shall not live; and if not to thee, has thy love
so base allay, my Pyrocles, as to wish me to live? sor dissimulation, my
Pyrocles, my simplicity is such, that I have hardly been able to keep
Pyrocles; and for that I do thank thee, and in my soul thank thee; for I
confess the love of thee is herein my chiefest virtue. Trouble me not
therefore, dear Pyrocles, nor Pyrocles; and love the remembrance of me: and
if I may crave so much of thee, let me be thy last love, for though I be not
worthy of thee (who indeed art the worthiest creature living) yet remember that
my love was a worthy love. But Pyrocles was so overcome with sorrow (which
wisdom Zelmanes labor: and then Zelmane warned by their presence, fell again
to persuade, Philoclea sweetly continuing constant, and in the end punishing
her importunity with silence, Zelmane was feign to end. Yet craving an other
times conference, she obtained it, and diverse others; till at the last
Cecropia found it was to no purpose, and therefore determined to follow her
own way. Zelmane yet still desirous to win (by Philocleas succor, but by
submitting the greatest courage of the earth to fall at the feet of Cecropia,
and crave stay of their sentence til the uttermost was seen, what her
persuasions might do.

Cecropia seemed much to be moved by her importunity, so as diverse days were
won of painful life to the excellent Philoclea: while Zelmane suffered some
hope to cherrish her mind, especially trusting upon the help of Musidorus,
who (she knew) would not be idle in this matter, till one morning a noise
awaked Zelmane, from whose ouer-watchfull mind, the tired body had stolen a
little sleep: and straight Philoclea. The horriblenes of the mischief was
such, as Pyrocles could not at first believe his own senses, but bent his
woeful eyes to discern it better: where too well he might see it was
Philocleas self, having no veil, but beauty, over the face, which still
appeared to be alive: so did those eyes shine, even as they were wont, and
they were wont more then any other: and sometimes as they moved, it might well
make the beholder think, that death therein had borrowed her beauty, and not
they any way disgraced by death: so sweet and pearsing a grace they carried with
them.

It was not a pity, it was not an amazement, it was not a sorrow which then
laid hold on Pyrocles, but a wild fury of desperate agony, so that he cried
out, O tyrant heaven, traitor earth, blind providence; no justice, how is
this done? how is this suffered? has this world a government? If it have, let
it pour out all his mischiefs upon me, and see whether it have power to make
me more wrecthed Philoclea dead, and do I live? and have I lived, not to
help her, but to talk of her? and stand I still talking? And with that
(carried with the madness of anguish, not having

And when he came again to himself, he heard, or he thought he heard a voice
which cried, Revenge, Revenge unto him; whether indeed it were his good
Angel, which used that voice to stay him from unnatural murdering of
himself; or that his wandering spirits lighted upon that conceit, and by
their weakness subject

Alas (said he) and is that head taken away too, so soon from mine eyes?
What, mine eyes, perhaps they envy the excellency of your sorrow? Indeed,
there thou could do. Exiled Beauty, let only now thy beauty be
blubbered faces, Widowed Music, let now thy tunes be rorings, and
lamentations. Orphane Virtue, get thee wings, and fly after her into heaven;
here is no dwelling place for thee. Why lived I, alas? Alas why loved I? to
die wretched, and to be the example Philoclea, thou art gone, and have carried
with thee my love; and have left thy love in me, and I wretched man do live; I
live, to die continually, till thy revenge do give me leave to die: and the^ die
I will, my Philoclea, my heart willingly makes this promise to it self. Surely
he did not look upon thee, that gave the cruel blow: for no eye Philoclea is
dead, and dead is with her all goodness, all sweetness al excellency.
Philoclea is dead, and yet Life is not ashamed to continue upon the earth.
Philoclea is dead: O deadly word; which contains in it self the uttermost of
al misfortunes. But happy word when thou shall be said of me, and long it
shall not be, before it be said.

Philoclea, sigh Philoclea, and cry out Philaclea: till as it happened (at
that time upon his bed) toward the dawning of the day, he heard one stir in
his chamber, by the motion of garments; and with an angry voice asked, Who was
there? A poor Gentlewoman (answered the party) that wish long life unto you.
And I soon death to you (said he) for the Zelmane, in Zelmane, nothing but
weak waylings fitter, for Pyrocles) that thou were a man that use these
words unto me. I tell thee I am sorry: I tell thee I will be sorry in despite
of thee, and all them that would have me joyful. And yet (replied she)
perchance Philoclea is not dead, whom you so much bemone I would we were both
dead of that condition, said Pyrocles. See the folly of your passion but for
some few years: so as it is time, and this world that seem so lovely things,
and not Philoclea unto you. O noble Sisters (cried Pyrocles) now you be gone
(who were the only exalters of all womankind) what is left in that sex, but
babbling, and business? And truly (said she) I will yet a little longer
trouble you. Nay, I pray you do (said Pyrocles) for I wish for nothing in my
short life, but mischiefs, and Philoclea (because she is yours) should be
exempted. But indeed you bemone your self, who have lost a friend: you
cannot her, who has in one act both preserved her honor, and lest the
miseries Pyrocles) as though if I do bemone my self, I have not reason to do
so, having lost more then any Monarchy, nay then my life can be worth unto
me. Alas (said she) comfort your self, Nature did not forget her skill,
when she had made them: you shall find many their superiors, and perchance
such, as (when your eyes shall look abroad) your

But that the speech put al good manners out of the conceit of Pyrocles; in so
much, that leaping out of his bed, he ran to have stricken her: but coming
near her (the morning then winning the field of darkness) he saw, or he
thought he saw, indeed, the very face of Philoclea; the same sweetness, the
same grace, the same beauty: Philoclea, the same Philoclea, so truly loving
you, so truly beloved of you. If it be so (said he) Philoclea, you have done
well to keep your own figure: for no heaven could have given you a better.
Then alas, why have you taken the pains to leave your blisfull seat to come to
this place most wretched, to me, who am wretchedness it self, and not rather
obtain for me, that I might come where you are, there eternally to behold, and
eternally to love your beauties? you know Pyrocles (said she) I am thy
Philoclea, and as yet living: not murdered, as you supposed, and therefore be
comforted. And with that gave him her hand, But the sweet touch of that hand
seemed, to his astraied powers so heavenly a thing, that it rather for a while
confirmed him in his former belief: Philoclea lived: which witnessing with
tears of joy, Alas (said he) how shall I believe mine eyes any more? or do
you yet but appear thus unto me, to stay me from some desperate end? For alas
I saw the excellent Pamela beheaded: can this be, my only dear, and you
live? or if this be not so, how can I believe mine own senses? and if I can
not believe them, why should I now believe these blessed tidings they bring me?

The truth is (said she) my Pyrocles, that neither I (as you find) nor yet my
dear Cecropia used slights to make either of us think so of other. For,
having in vain attempted the fardest of her wicked eloquence, to make either
of us yield to her son, and seeing that neither it, accompanied with great
flatteries, and rich presents, could get any ground of us, nor yet the violent
way she fell into of cruelly tormenting our bodies, could prevail Artesia, she
who so cunningly brought us to this misery. Truly I am sorry for the poor
Gentlewoman, though justly she be punished Artesia muffled so, as you could not
easily discern her; and in my sisters apparel (which they had taken from her
under color of giving her other) did they execute: And when I (for thy sake
especially dear Pyrocles) could by no force, nor fear be won, they assayed
the like with my sister, by bringing me down under the scaffolde, and (making
me thrust my Pamela, rather worse then my self, (the strength of her heart
worse bearing those indignities) the good woman Cecropia (with the same pity
as folks keep foul, when they are not fat enough for their eating) made us
know her deceit, and let us come one to another; with what joy Amphialus:
Cecropia keeps him from understanding things how they pass, only having
heard a whispering, and my self named, he had (of abundance, forsooth, of
honorable love) given this charge for us. Whereupon this enlargement of mine
was grown: for my part I know too well their cunning (who leave no money
vnoffered that may buy mine honor) to believe any word they say, but (my dear
Pyrocles) even look for the worste, and prepare my self for the same. Yet I
must Pyrocles. And so having leave, I came stealing into your chamber: where (O
Lord) what a joy it was unto me, to hear you solemnise the funerals of the
poor Philoclea? That I my self might live to hear my death bewailed? and by
whom? by my Pyrocles. That I saw death was not strong enough to divide thy love
from me? O my Pyrocles, I am too well paid for my pains I have suffered:
joyful is my woe for so noble a cause; and welcome be all miseries, since to
thee I am so welcome. Alas how I pitied to hear thy pity of me; and yet a
great while I could not find in my heart to interrupt thee, but often had even
pleasure to weep with Philoclea dye. Till at last I spoke with you, to try
whether I could remove thee from sorrow, till I had almost procured my self a
beating. And with that she pretily smiled, which, mingled with her tears, one
could not tell whether it were a mourning pleasure, or a delightful sorrow:
Zephyrus among fine colored flowers. But Pyrocles, who had felt (with so small
distance of time) in himself the overthrow both of hope and despair, knew not
to what key he should tune his mind, either of joy, or sorrow. But finding
perfect reason in neither, suffered himself to be carried by the tide of his
imagination, and his imaginations to be raised Amphialus, as that she might but
procure

But who would lively describe the manner of these speeches, should paint out
the lightsome colors of affection, shaded with the deepest shadows of
sorrow, finding then between hope and fear, a kind of sweetenes in tears:
till Philoclea Pyrocles, sealed up his moving lips, and closed them up in
comfort: and her-selfe (for the passage was left between them open) went to
her sister: with whom she had stayed but a while, fortifying one another (while
Philoclea tempered Pamelas just disdain, and Pamela ennobled Philocleas sweet
humbleness) when Amphialus came unto them: who never since Philoclea named,
could be quiet in himself, although none of them about him (fearing more his
mothers violence then his power) would discover what had passed: and many
messages he sent to know her estate, which brought answers back, according as
it pleased Cecropia to indite them, till his heart full of unfortunate
affection, more and more misgiuing him, having impatiently borne the delay of
the nights unfitness, this morning he gat up, and though full of

But Pamelaes hye heart (having conceived mortal hate for the injury offered to
her and her sister) could scarcely abide his sight, much less hear out his
excuses; but interrupted him with these words. Traitor (said she) to thine own
blood, and false to the profession of so much love as thou have vowed, do not
defile our Philoclea. And is this (most excellent Lady) your doom of me also?
She, sweet

But when she saw him come in with a sword drawn, and a look more terrible
then known, whom she had in her Country, but so old, as not able to
travail: but had given her sovereign annointments, to preserve his body
withal, till he might be brought unto him: and that Basilius had granted
leave: either natural kindness prevailing over all the offenses done, or rather
glad to make any passage, which might lead him out of his country, and from
his daughters. This discourse Lycurgus understanding of Helene, delivered to
his brother, with her vehement desire to see the body, and take her last
farewell of him. Anaxius, though he were fallen out with all womankind (in
respect of the hate he bare the sisters, whom he accounted murderers of
Amphialus) yet at his brothers request, granted her leave. And she (poor
Lady) with grievous expectation, and languishing desire,

In which pittious plight when she saw him, though Sorrow had set before her
mind the pittifullest conceit thereof that it could paint, yet the present
sight went beyond all former apprehensions: so that beginning to kneel by the
body, her Amphialus, what Amphialus, and be grieved withal? that I should
have thee in my power without glory, and embrace thee without comfort? How
often have I blessed the means that might bring me near thee? Now, woe worth
the cause that brings me so near thee. Often, alas, often have Amphialus,
receive them: these eyes can serve for nothing else, but to weep for thee;
since thou would never vouchsafe them thy comfort, yet disdain not them thy
sorrow. I would they had been more dear unto thee; for then had thou lived.
Woe is me that thy noble heart could love who hated thee, and hate who loved
thee. Alas, why should not my Philoclea) wheresoever you are, pardon me, if I
speak in the bitterness of my soul, excellent may you be in all other things
(and excellent sure you are since he Philoclea to love thee? who could, or (if
every one could) who would have recounted thy perfections so well, as I? who
with such kindly passions could have stirred pity for thee as I? who should
have delivered not only the words, but the tears I had of thee? and so
should thou have exercised thy

With that the body moving somewhat, and giving a groneful of deaths music,
she fell upon his face, and kissed him, and with all cried out. O miserable I,
that have only favor by misery: and then, would she have returned to a
fresh careere of complaints, when an aged and wise Gentleman came to her, and
besought her, to remember what was fit for her greatness, wisdom, and honor:
and with all, that Anaxius, and humbling Anaxius valor, then Basilius promise)
that he would convey them safely out of those territories Her reasons something
moved him, but nothing thoroughly persuaded him, but the last request of his
help: which he straight promised, warranting all security, as long as that
sword had his master alive. She as happy therein as unhappiness could Anaxius
had not kept them under, they would have mutinied, rather then suffered his
body to be carried away.

Anaxius him self riding before the litter, with the choice men of that place^
they were afraid even to cry, though they were ready to cry for fear: but
(because that they might do) every body forced (even with harming themselves)
to do honor to him: some throwing themselves upon the ground; some tearing
their clothes, and casting duste upon their heads, and some even woundring
themselves

The general consort of whose mourning, performed so the natural tunes of
sorrow; that even to them (if any such were) that felt not the loss, yet
others grief taught them grief; having before their compassionate sense so
passionate a spectacle, of a young man, of great beauty, beautified with great
honor, honored by great

Which so moved Anaxius to consider the loss of his friend, that (his mind
apter to revenge, then tenderness) he presently giving order to his brother
to keep the prisoners safe, and unvisited, till his return from conueying
Helen he sent a messenger to the sisters, to tell them this courteous message:
that at his return with

This message was brought unto the sisters, as they sat at that time together
with Zelmane, conferring how to carry themselves, having heard of the death of
Amphialus. And as no expectation of death is so paineful, as where the
resolution is hindered by the intermixing of hopes, so did this new alarm,
though not remove, yet move somewhat the constancy of their minds, which were
so inconstantly dealt with. But within a while, the excellent Pamela had
brought her mind again to his old Philoclea, dear sister, I was so beaten
with the evils of life, that though I had not virtue enough to despise the
sweetness of it, yet my weakness bredde that strength, to be weary of the
pains of it: only I must confess, that little hope, which by these late
accidents was awaked in me, was at the first angry withal. But even in the
darkness of that horror, I see a light of comfort appear; and how can
Pamela steps? I would only (O that my wish might take place) that my
schoole-Mistres might live, to see me say my lesson truly. Were that a life,
my Philoclea? said Pamela. No, no, (said she) let it come, and put on his
worst face: for at the worst it is but a bug-beare. Joy is it to me to see you
so well resolved; and since the world will not have us, let it lose us. Only
(with that she stayed Philoclea, (then she bowed down, and whispered in her
ear) only Musidorus, my shepherd, comes between me and death, and makes me
think I should not dye, because I know he would not I should dye. With that
Philoclea sighed also, saying no more, but looking upon Zelmane: who was
walking up and down the chamber, having heard this message from Anaxius, and
having Pamela nobly, Philoclea sweetly, and Zelmane sadly, and desperately
none of them entertaining sleep, which they thought should shortly begin never
to awake.

But Anaxius came home, having safely conduct Helen and safely he might well
do it: For though many of Basilius Knights would have attempted something
Anaxius, by that means to deliver the Ladies; yet Philanax, having received
his masters commandment, and knowing his word was given, would not consent
unto it. And the black-Knight (who by them was able to carry abroad his wounds)
did not know thereof; but was bringing force, by force to deliver his Lady. So
as Anaxius, interpreting it rather fear, then faith, and making even chance an
argument Pamela; who hearing he was coming, and looking for death, thought
she would keep her own majesty in welcomming it; but the beams thereof so
struck his eyes, with such a counterbuffe unto his pride, that if his anger
could not so quickly love, nor his pride so easily honor, yet both were forced
to find a worthiness.

Zelmane (who had ready in her mind both what and how to say) stepped out unto
him, and with a resolute stayednes (void either of anger, kindness, disdain, or
humbleness) speak in this sort. Anaxius (said she) if Fame have not been
ouerpartiall to thee, thou art a man of exceeding valor. Therefore I do call
thee even before that virtue, and will make it the judge between

Zelmane began her speech, the excellency of her beauty, and grace, made him a
little content to hear. Besides that, a new lesson he had read in Pamela had
already taught him some regard. But when she entered into bravery of speech,
he thought at first, a mad, and railing humor possessed her; till, finding the
speeches hold well together, and at length come to flat challenge of combat;
he stood leaning Zoilus, and said nothing, but only lifting up his eyes,
smiled. But Zelmane Anaxius (said she) perchance thou disdaynest to answer me
because, as a woman, thou think me not fit to be fought with all. But I
tell thee, that I have been trained up in martial matters, with so good
success, that I have many times overcome brauer Knights then thy self: and
am well known to be equal in feats of arms, to the famous Pyrocles, who
slew thy valiant Uncle, Euardes. The remembrance of his Uncles death
some^hing netled him, so as he answered thus.

Indeed (said he) any woman may be as valiant as that coward, and traytorly
boy, who slew my Uncle traitorously, and after ran from me in the plain
field. Five thousand such could not have overcome Euardes, but by falsehood. But
I sought Asia, following him still from one of his cony-holes to another: till
coming into this Country, I heard of my friends being besieged, and so came
to blow away the wretches that troubled him. But wheresoever the miserable boy
fly, heaven, nor hell, shall keep his heart from being torn by these hands.
Thou lie in thy throat (said Zelmane) that boy, where ever he went, did so
noble acts, as thy heart (as proud as it is) dares not think of, much less
perform. But to please thee the better with my presence, I tell thee, no
creature can be nearer of kin to him, then my self: and so well we love,
that he would not be sorrier for his own death Anaxius, but that he only
said, Evil should it become the terror of the world, to fight, much worse to
skolde with thee.

But (said he) for the death of these same (pointing to the Princesses) of my
grace, Pamela, and offering to take her by the chin, And as for you, Minion
(said he) yield but gently to my will, and you shall not only live, but live
so happily, He would have said further, when Pamela, displeased both with
words, matter, and manner, putting him away with her fair hand, Proud beast
(said she) yet thou plaiest worse thy Comedy, then thy Tragedy. For Cupid had
begun to make it his sport, to pull his plumes: so that, unused to a way of
courtesy, and put out of his byas of pride, he Lycurgus, liked Philoclea, and
Zoilus would needs love Zelmane; or at lest, entertain themselves with making
them believe so. Lycurgus more braggard, and near his brothers humor, began,
with setting forth their blood, their deeds, how many they had despised, of
most excellent Philocleas shamefastnes, and humblenes, were as strong
resisters, as choler, and disdain. For though she yielded not, he thought
she was to be overcome: and that thought a while stayed him from further
violence. But Zelmane had eye to his behavior, Zoilus; who less full of
bragges was forwardest in offering (indeed) dishonorable violence.

But when after their fruitless labors they had gone away called by their
brother, (who began to be perplexed between new conceived desires, and
disdain, Zelmane (who with most assured quietness of judgment looked into
their present estate) earnestly persuaded the two sisters, that to avoid the
mischiefs of proud outrage they would only so far suit their behavior to
their estates, as they might win time; which as it could not bring them to
worse case then they were, so it might bring forth inexpected relief. And why
(said Pamela) Fortune since our own parents are content to be tyraunts over
us, since our own kin are content traitorously to abuse us? Certainly, in
mishap it may be some comfort to us, that we are lighted in these fellows
hands, who yet will keep us from having cause of being miserable by our
friends Zelmane (to whom the world might have made us able to do honor)
should receive only hurt by the contagion of our misery. As for me, and my
sister, undoubtedly it becomes our birth to think of dying nobly, while we
have done, or suffered nothing, which might make our soul ashamed at the
parture from these bodies. Hope is the fawning Zelmane) what you say is true;
and that truth may well make up a part in the harmony of your noble thoughts.
But yet the time (which ought always to be one) is not tuned for it; while
that may" bring forth any good, do not bar your self thereof: for then
will be the time Pamela yielded to her, because she spoke reason; and
Philoclea yielded to her reason, because she spoke it.

Pamela forced her self to make answer to Anaxius, that if her father gave
his consent she would make her self believe, that such was the heavenly
determination, since she had no means to avoid it. Anaxius (who was the most
frank promiser to him self of success) nothing doubted of Basilius consent,
but rather assured him self, he Basilius, and to make him know, that if he
meant to have his daughter both safe and happy, and desired himself to have
such a son in law, as would not only protect him in his quiet course, but
Anaxius, who never before knew what it was to pray any thing. That if he did
not, he would make him know, that the power of Anaxius was in every thing
beyond his will, and yet his will not to be resisted by any other power. His
servant with smiling and caste-vp look, desired God to make his memory able
to Anaxius spoke it, to persuade rocky minds to their own harm: so little
doubted he to win Basilius to that, which Anaxius gravely allowed the
probability of his conjecture, and therefore sent him away, promising him he
should have the bringing up of his second son by Pamela.

The messenger with speed performed his Lords commandment to Basilius, who
by nature quiet, and by superstition made doubtful, was loathe to take any
matter of arms in hand, wherein already he had found so slow success;
though Philanax vehemently urged him thereunto, making him see that his
retiring back Basilius betwixt the fear of Anaxius might, the passion of his
love and jealousy of his estate, was so perplexed, that notable to determine,
he took the common course of men, to fly only then to devotion, when they
want resolution: therefore detaining the messenger with delays, he deferred
the directing of his course to the counsel of Apollo, which because himself
at that time Philanax: who (as one in whom obedience was a sufficient reason
unto him) went with diligence to Delphos, where being entered into the secret
place of the temple, and having performed the sacrifices usual, the spirit
that possessed the prohesying woman, with a sacred fury, attended not his
demand, but as if it would argue him of incredulity, Basilius, and will him
to deny his daughters to Anaxius and his brothers, for that they were reserved
for such as were better beloved of the gods. That he should not doubt, for
they should return unto him safely and speedily. And that he should keep on
his solitary course, til both Philanax and Basilius fully agreed in the
understanding of the former prophecy: withal, commanding Philanax from
thenceforward to give tribute, but not oblation, to humane wisdom.

" Philanax then finding that reason cannot show it self more reasonable,
then to leave reasoning in things above reason, returns to his Lord, and like
one that preferred Basilius to bemone the absence of his daughters, and to
bewail the imprisonment of Zelmane: yet wholly given holily to obey the
Oracle, he gave a resolute negative unto the messenger of Anaxius, who all this
while had waited for it, yet in good terms desiring him to show him self, in
respect of his birth and profession, so Princely a Knight, as without forcing
him to seek the way of force, to deliver Amphialus, and the benefit in him.

The messenger went back with this answer, yet having ever used to sugre any
thing which his Master was to receive, he told him, that when Basilius first
understood his desires, he did ouerreach so far all his most hopeful
expectations, that Delphos, who although he kept the matter never so secret,
yet his diligence, inspired by Anaxius privilege over all worldly things, had
found out the secret, which was, that he should not presume to marry his

Anaxius, who till then had made Fortune his creator, and Force his God, now
began to find an other wisdom to be above, that judged so rightly of him:
and where in this time of his servants waiting for Basilius resolution, he
and his brothers had courted their Ladies, as whom they vouchsafed to have for
their Anaxius had word, that from the Tower there were descried some companies
of armed men, marching toward the town; wherefore he gave present order to
his servants, and soldiers, to go to the gates and walls, leaving none
within but himself, and his brothers: his thoughts then so full of their
intended pray, that Mars-his

But while he was directing what he would have done, his youngest brother
Zoilus, glad that he had the commission, went in the name of Anaxius, to tell
the sisters, that since he had answer from their father, that he and his
brother Licurgus, should have them in what sort it pleased them, that they
would now grant them Pamela made him answer, that in a matter whereon the
whole state of her life depended, and wherein she had ever answered, she would
not lead, but follow her parents pleasure; she thought it reason she should,
either by letter, or particular messenger understand something from themselves,
Zelmane. But Zelmane (having had all this while of the messengers being with
Basilius, much to do to keep those excellent Ladies from seeking by the
pasport of death, to escape those base dangers whereunto they found themselves
subject) still hoping that Musidorus would find some means to deliver the^;
Zoilus smacking his lips, as for the Prologue of a kiss, and something
advancing himself, Darling (said he) let thy heart be full of joy, and let thy
fair eyes be of counsel with it, for this day thou shall have Zoilus, whom
many have lo^ged for; but none shall have him, but Zelmane. And oh, how much
good may your thoughts do you, but that I may not dissemble with you, my
nativity being cast by one that never failed in any of his prognostications, I
have been assured, that I should never be apt to bear children. But since you
will honor me with so hie favor, I must only desire that I may perform a vow
which I made among my countriwomen, the famous Amazons, that I would never
marry Zoilus (but laughing with a hearty lowdnes) went by force to embrace
her; making no other answer, but since she had a mind to try his

But in Zelmane then Disdain became wisdom, and Anger gave occasion. For
abiding no longer abode in the matter, she that had not put off, though she had
disguised, Pyrocles, being far fuller of strong nimblenes, tript up his
feet, so that he Proserpina, an angry Goddess against rauishers. But Anaxius,
seeing before his eyes the miserable end of his brother, fuller of despite then
wrath, and yet fuller of wrath then sorrow, looking with a woeful eye upon his
brother Lycurgus, Brother, said he, chastise this vile creature, while I
Zelmane. But Zelmane no sooner saw those brothers, of whom Reason assured her
she was to expect revenge, but that she lept to a target, "as one that well
knew the first mark of valor to be defense. And then accepting the
opportunity of Anaxius going away, she waited not the pleasure of Lycurgus, but
Lycurgus, who was in the disposition of his nature hazardouse, and by the
luckie passing through many dangers, grown confident in himself, went toward
her, rather as to a spoil, then to fight, so far from fear, that his
assuredness disdained to hope. Mars himself might have bin delighted to look
on. But Zelmane, who knew that in her case, slownesse of victory was little
better then ruin, with the bellows of hate, blew the fire of courage, and he
striking a maine blow at her head, she warded it with the shield, but so
warded, that the shield was cut in two pieces, while it protected her, and
withal she ran in to him, and thrusting at his breast, which Zelmane ready to
conclude her victory in his death, bowing up his head to her, with a
countenance that had forgotten Zelmane represt a while her great heart, either
disdaining to be cruel, or pitiful, and therefore not cruel: and now the image
of humane condition, began to be an Orator unto her of compassion, when she
saw, as he lifted up his arms with a supplia^ts grace, about one of the^,
unhappily tied, a garter with a Jewel, which (given to Pyrocles by his aunt of
Thessalia, and greatly esteemed by him) he had presented to Philoclea, and with
inward rage promising extreme hatred, had seen Lycurgus with a proud force,
and not without some hurt unto her, pull away from Philoclea, because at
entreatie she would not give it him. But the sight of that was like a cyphar,
signifying all the injuries which Philoclea had of him suffered, and that
remembrance feeding upon wrath, trod down al co^ceits of mercy. And therefore
saying no more, but No villain, Philoclea that sends thee this token for thy
love. With that she made her sword drink the blood of his heart, though he
wresting his body, and with a countenance prepared to excuse, would feign have
delaied the receiving of deaths ambassadors. But neither that stayed Zelmanes
hand, nor yet Anaxius cry unto her, who having made fast the iron gate, even
then came to the top of the stairs, when, contrary Zelmanes mercy. Therefore
crying, promising, and threatening to her to hold her hand: the last groan of
his brother was the only answer he could get to his unrespected eloquence.
But then Pity would feign have drawn tears, which Fury in their spring
dried; and Anger would feign have spoken, but that Disdain sealed up his
lips; but in his heart he Zelmane, use of fighting Zelmane in such a well
defended manner, that in all the combats that ever she had fought, she had
never more need of quick senses, and ready virtue. For being one of the
greatest men of stature then living, as he did fully answer that stature in
greatness of might, so did he exceed both in greatness of courage, which with
a countenance formed by the nature both of his mind and body, to an almost
horrible fiercenes, was able to have carried fear to any mind, that was not
privy Pyrocles, whose soul might well be separated from his body, but never
alienated from the remembering what was comely, if at the first he did a little
apprehend the dangerousnes of his adversary, whom once before he had something
tried, and now perfectly saw, as the very picture of forcible fury: yet was
that apprehension quickly stayed in him, rather Anaxius, being like Philocleas
captivity to Pyrocles. Who had seen the one, would have thought nothing could
have resisted; who had marked the other, would have Pallas had been there, she
could scarcely Anaxius was better armed defensiuely: for (beside a strong caske
bravely covered, wherewith he covered his head) he had a huge shield, such
perchance, as Achilles Pyrocles, utterly unarmed for defense, to offend had the
advantage: for, in either hand he had a sword, and with both hands nimbly
performed that office. And according as they were diversely furnished, so did
they differ in the manner of fighting. For Anaxius most by warding, and
Pyrocles oftnest by avoiding, resisted

So that consenting by the mediation of necessity, to a breathing time of
truce, being withdrawn a little one from the other; Anaxius stood leaning upon
his sword, with his grim eye, so settled upon Zelmane, as is wont to be the
look of an earnest thought. Which Zelmane marking, and, according to the
Pyroclean nature, fuller of Anaxius, that thou so deeply musest on? Does thy
brothers example make thee think of thy fault past, or of thy coming
punishment? I think (said he) what spiteful God it should be, who, envying my
glory, has brought me to such a wayward case, that neither thy death can be a
revenge, nor thy overthrow a victory. Thou do well indeed (said Zelmane) to
impute thy case to the heavenly providence,

But then, having sufficiently rested themselves, they renewed again their
combatte, far more terribly then before: like nimble vaulters, who at the
first and second leap, do but stir, and (as it were) awake the fiery and
aerie parts, which Anaxius oftener used blows, his huge force (as it were)
more Pyrocles, of a more fine, and deliver strength, watching his time when to
give fit thrustes; as, with the quick obeying of his body, to his eyes
quick commandment, he shunned any harm Anaxius could do to him: so would he
soon have made an end of Anaxius, if he had not found him a man of wonderful,
and almost Pyrocles used diverse faynings to bring Anaxius on, into some
inconvenience. But Anaxius keeping a sound manner of fighting, never offered,
but seeing fair cause, and then followed it with wel-gouerned violence. Thus
spent they a great time, striving to do, and with striving to do, wearying
themselves, more then with the very doing. Anaxius finding Zelmane so Zelmane
strongly putting it by with her right hand sword, coming in with her left
foot, and hand, would have given a sharp visitation to his right side, but
that he was feign to leap away. Whereat ashamed, (as having never done so
much before in his life.)

Basilius, and how Dorus again returned to his old master Damaetas, is
altogether unknown. What a^terward chanced, out of the Authors own writings
and conceits has been supplied, as follows. Basilius (according to the
oracles promise) had received home his daughters, and settled himself again
in his solitary course and accustomed company, there passed not many days ere
the now fully recomforted Dorus having waited a time of Zelmanes walking alone
toward her little Arbor, took leave of his master Damaetas husbandry to
follow her. Near whereunto ouertaking it may be enuyed: but may freely send it
to such a well grounded object, from whence he shall be sure to receive a
sweet reflection of the same joy, and, as in a clear mirror of sincere good
will, see a lively picture of his own gladness. But after much discourse on
either part, Dorus (his heart scarce serving him to come to the point,
whereunto his then coming had been wholly directed, as loath Zelmane, how
Pamela upon his vehement oath to offer no force unto her, till he had invested
her in the Duchy of Thessalia, had condiscended to his stealing her away to
the next sea port. That besides the strange humors she saw her father more
and more falling into, Dorus, my dear Cozen, to whom nature began my
friendship, education confirmed it, and virtue has made it eternal, here
have I discoue^ed the very foundation whereupon my life is built: be you the
Judge betwixt Pyrocles, might ever be objected to the faithful Musidorus. But
if you can spare my presence, whose presence no way serves you, and by the
division of these two Lodges is not often with you: nay if you Basilius, willing
or unwilling, to know his own hap in granting you Philoclea: then I will
cheerefullie go about this my most desired enterprise, and shall think the
better half of it already achieved, being begun in the fortunate hour of
my friends contentment. These words, as Dorus was wont to use: so was his
voice interrupted with sighs, and his countenance with enterchanging color
dismayed. So much his own heart did find him faulty to vnbende any way the
continual use of their dear friendship. But Zelmane, who had all this while
gladly hearkened to the other Dorus struck her attentive ears, she stayed a
great while oppressed with a dead amazement. There came straight before her
mind, made tender with woes, the images of her own fortune. Her tedious
longings, her causes to despair, the combersome folly of Basilius, the
enraged Jealousy of Gynecia, her self a Prince without retinewe; a man
annoyed with the troubles of woman-kinde; lothsomely loved, and dangerously
Musidorus, for mine own sake, and that our friendshipp grew because I for
Musidorus, with the guide of virtue, and service of fortune. Let thy love be
loved, thy desires prosperous, thy escape safe, and thy iornye easy. Let every
thing yield his help to thy deserte, for my part Dorus would feign have
replied again, to have made a liberal confession that Zelmane had of her side
the advantage of well performing friendship: but partly his own grief of
parting from one he loved so dearly, partly Zelmane, bredd such a conflicte in
his mind, that many times he wished, he had either never attempted, or never
revealed this secreat enterprise. But Zelmane, who had now looked to the
vttermoste of it, and established her mind upon an assured determination, my
only friend said she since to so good towardnes, your courteous destinies
have conducted you, let not Zelmane said Dorus with his eyes even covered with
water, I did not think so soon Pyrocles shall not Pyrocles shall not be held
of me in devout reverence.

They would never have come to the cruel instant of parting, nor to the
il-faring word of farewell, had not Zelmane seen a far off the old Basilius,
who having performed a sacrifice to Apollo, for his daughters, but principally
for his mistress happy Alas said Zelmane, behold an evil fore-token of your
sorrowful departure. Yonder see I one of my furies, which does daily vex me,
farewell fare well my Musidorus, the Gods make fortune to wait on thy virtues,
and make me wade through this lake of wretchedness. Dorus burst out into a
flood of tears wringing her fast by the hand. No, no, said he, I go
blindfold, whither the course of my ill hap caries me: Daiphantus and
Palladius, as before had been agreed between the^) they took diverse ways:
Dorus to the lodg-ward, where his heavy eyes might be something refreshed;
Zelmane toward Basilius: saying to her self with a skornefull smiling: yet
has not my friendly fortune deprived me of a pleasant companion. But he having
with much search come to her presence, Doubt and Desire bred a great quarrel
in his mind. For his former experience Apollo: since he (if he know any thing)
knows that my heart Deity. You will ever be deceived in me, answered Zelmane: I
will make my self no competitor with Apollo, neither can blasphemies to him be
duties to me. With that Basilius took out of his bosom certain verses he had
written, and kneling down, presented them to her. They contained this: Phoebus
farewell, a sweeter Saint I serve,
The high conceits thy heavenly wisdoms breed
My thoughts forget: my thoughts, which never swerue
From her, in whom is sown their freedoms seed,
And in whose eyes my daily doom I reed.
Phoebus farewell, a sweeter Saint I serve.
Thou art far off, thy kingdom is above:
She heaven on earth with beauties does preserve.
Thy beams I like, but her clear rays I love:
Thy force I fear, her force I still do prove.
Phoebus yield up thy title in my mind.
She does possess, thy Image is defaste,
But if thy rage some brave revenge will find,
On her, who has in me thy temple raste,
Employ thy might, that she my fires may taste.
And how much more her worth surmounteth thee,
Make her as much more base by loving me.


This is my Hymn to you, said he, not left me by my ancestors, but begone in
Zelmane, who ever thought she found in his speeches the ill taste of a
medecin, and the operation of a poison, would have suffered a disdainful look
to have been the only witness of her good acceptance; but that Basilius
began a fresh to lay before her many pitiful prayers, and in the end to
conclude that he was fully of opinion it was only the vnfortunatenes of that
place Philanax would agree with his) and his late mishapes had taught him how
perilous it was to commit a Princes state to a place so weakly guarded: He
was now inclined to return to his palace in Mantinea, and there he Zelmane.
For the good beginning she had there obtained of Philoclea made her desire to
continue the same trade, till unto the more perfecting of her desires: and to
come to any public place ^hee did deadly Soil.

Therefore casting a kind of corner look upon him, it is truly said, (said
she) that age cools the blood. How soon goodman you are terrified before
you receive any hurt? Do you not know that daintines is kindly unto us? And
that hard obtaining, is the excuse of woman's granting? Yet speak I not as
though you Basilius humbly swell, and with a lowly look stand upon his
tiptoes; such diversity her words delivered unto him. O Hercules answered he;
Basilius afraid? Or Zelmane thought it not good for his stomach, to receive a
surfeit of too much Basilius that thought every dropp a flood that bred any
refreshment, durst not further press her, but with an ancient Zelmane as soon
as he was departed went toward Pamelas lodge in hope to have seen her friend
Dorus, to have pleased her self with another paynefull farrewell, and further
to have taken some advise with him touching her own estate, whereof before
sorrow had not suffered her to think. But being come even near the lodge, she
saw the mouth Tagus caries in his sandy bed. The cave framed out into many
goodly spacious Rooms such as the selfe-liking men, have with long and learned
delicacie found out the most easefull. There rann through it a little sweet
River, which had left the face of the earth to drown her self for a small
way in this dark but pleasant mansion. The very first show of the place
entised the melancholy mind of Zelmane SInce that the stormy rage of passions
darcke
(Of passions dark, made dark of beauties light)
Whith rebel force, has closde in dungeon dark
My mind ere now led forth by reasons light:
Since all the things which give mine eyes their light
Do foster still, the fruits of fancies dark:
So that the windows of my inward light
Do serve, to make my inward powers dark:
Since, as I say, both mind and senses dark
Are hurt, not helped, with piercing of the light:
While that the light may show the horrors dark
But cannot make resolved darkness light:
I like this place, whereat the least the dark
May keep my thoughts, from thought of wonted light.


In steed of an instrument, her song was accompanied with the wringing of her
hands, the closing of her weary eyes, and even sometime cut off with the
swellinge Hark plaintfull ghostes, infernal furies hark
Unto my woes the hateful heavens do send,
The heavens conspired, to make my vital spark
A wreched wrack, a glass of Ruins end.
Seeing, Alas; so mighty powers bend
Their ireful shot against so weak a mark,
Come cave, become my grave, come death, and lend
Receipte to me, within thy bosom dark.
For what is life to daily dieng mind,

Where too much sight, makes all the body blind,
And highest thoughts, downward most headlong throw?
Thus then my form, and thus my state I find,
Death wrapped in flesh, to living grave assigned.


And pawsing but a little, with monefull melody it continued this octaue: Like
those sick folks, in whom strange humors flow,
Can taste no sweetes, the sower only please:

Whose fyrie chains, upon his freedom feaze,
Ioies strangers seem, I cannot bide their show,
Nor brook ought else but well acquainted woe.
Bitter grief tastes me best pain is my ease,



O Venus, said Zelmane, who is this so well acquainted with me, that can make
so lively a portracture of my miseries? It is surely the spirit appointed to
have care of me, which does now in this dark place bear part with the
complaints of his How is my Sunn, whose beams are shining bright

Or how do I captived in this dark plight,
Bewail the case, and in the cause delight?
My mangled mind huge horrors still do fright,

Betwixt which two in me I have this fight,
Where who so wynns, I put my self to flight.
Come clowdie fears close up my daseled sight,

Due sighs blow out all sparks of joyful light,
Tire on despaier upon my tired sprite.
An end, an end, my dulde penn cannot write,
Nor mas'de head think, nor faltring tongerecite.


And hard underneath the sonnet, were these words written: This cave is dark,
but it had never light.
This wax does waste it self, yet painelesse dies.
These words are full of woes, yet feel they none.
I darkened am, who once had clearest sight.
I waste my heart, which still new torment tryes.
I plain with cause, my woes are all mine own,
No cave, no wasting wax, no words of grief,
Can hold, show, tell, my pains without relief.


She did not long stay to read the words, for not far off from the stone
she might discern in a dark corner, a Lady lieng with her face so prostrate
upon the ground, as she could neither know, nor be known. But (as the general
nature of man is desirous of knowledge, and sorrow especially glad to find
fellows,) she went Gynecia. Zelmane, no sooner heard the name of Gynecia, but
that with a cold sweat all over her, as if she had been ready to tread upon a
deadly stinging Adder, she would have Gynecia suddenly risne up, for in deed
it was Ginecia, gotten into this Cave, (the same Cave, wherein Dametas had
safely kept Pamela in the late uproar) to pass her pangs, with change of
places. And as her mind ran still upon Zelmane, her piercing lovers eye had
soon found it was she. And seeing in her a countenance to fly away, she fell
Gynecia so unworthy in thine eyes? or whom cannot abundance of love, make
worthy? O think not that cruelty, or ungratefulness, can flow from a good
mind! O weigh, Alas! weigh with thy Zelmane imputing it, to Gynecia, how good
leisure you have to frame these scornful answers? Is Ginecia thus to be
despised? am I so vile a worm in your sight? no no, trust to it hard hearted
tigre, I will not be the only Actor of this Tragedy: since I must fall, I will
press down some others with my ruins: since I must burn, my spiteful
neighbors shall feel of my fire. Basilius shall know how thou have sotted his
mind Zelmane that had long before doubted her self to be discovered by her,
and now plainly finding it, was as the proverb Philoclea, it had been worse
then a thousand deaths. Yet found she it was necessary for her, to come to a
resolution, for Gynecias sore could bide no leisure, and once Philoclea, her
desires should be for ever utterly stopped. She remembered withal the words of
Basilius, how apt he was to leave this life, and return to his court, a great
bar to her hopes. Lastly she considered Dorus enterprise, might bring some
strange alteration of this their well liked fellowship. So that encompassed
with these instant difficulties, she bent her spirits to think of a remedy,
And that following their own current, at length of it self it would bring her
to the other side of her burning desires.

Now in the mean while the divided Dorus, long divided between love and
friendship, and now for his love divided from his friend, though indeed without
prejudice of frendships loyalty, which does never bar the mind from his
free satisfaction: Pamelas consent, confirmed and concluded under the name of
Mopsa in her own presence, Dorus taking this way, that whatsoever he would
have of Pamela he would ask her, whether Mopsa so to behave her self, in that
sort making Mopsas envy, an instrument of that she did envy. So having passed
over, his first and most feared difficulty, he busied his spirits how to come
to the harvest of his desires, whereof he had so fair a show. And thereunto
(having gotten leave for some days of his master Damaetas, who now accounted
him as his son in law,) Damaetas, he found most easily sturred with
covetousness. The cursed mischeuous heart of Miso, most apt to be tickled with
jealousy, as whose rotten brain Mopsa, who could open her eyes upon nothing,
that did not all to bewonder her, he thought curiosity the fittest bait for
her. And first for Damaetas, Dorus having imploid a whole days work, about a
ten mile off from the lodge (quite contrary way to that he meant to take with
Pamela) in digging and opening the ground, under an ancient oak that stood
there, in such sort Damaetas greedy hopes, in some show of comfort, he came to
his master, with a countenance mixed betwixt cherefulnes and haste, and taking
him by the right hand, as if he had a great matter of secrecy to reveal unto
him: Master said he, I did never think that the gods had appointed my mind
freely brought up, to have so longing a desire to serve you, but that they
minded thereby to bring some Damaetas play upon the bit a while, who not
understanding what his words intended, yet well finding, they carried no evil
news, Mopsa, though she had been all made of cloth of gold, he besought Dorus
not to hold him long in hope, for that he found it a thing his heart was not
able to bear. Master, answered Dorus, you have so satisfied me, with
promising me the uttermost of my desired bliss, that if my duty bound me not,
I were in it sufficiently rewarded. To you therefore shall my good hap be
converted, and the fruit of all my labor dedicated. Therewith he told him, how
under an ancient oak, (the place he made him easily understand, by sufficient
marks he gave unto him) he had found digging but a little depth, scatteringly
lying a great number of rich Medailles, and that percing further Aristomenes
graven upon it: and that within the box, he found certain verses, which
signified that some depth again under that all his treasures lay hidden, what
time for the discord fell out in Arcadia he lived banished. Damaetas certain
Medailles of gold he had long kept about him, and asked him because it was a
thing much to be kept secret, and a matter one man in twenty hours might
easily perform, whether he would have him go and seek the bottom of it,
which he had refrained to do till he knew his mind, promising he would
faithfully bring him what he found, or else that he himself would do it, and
Damaetas would choose, whose fancy had already devoured all this great riches,
and even now began to grudge at a partenor, before he saw his own share.
Therefore taking a strong Jade, laden with spades and mattocks, which he meant
to bring back otherwise laden, he went in all speed thetherward, taking leave
of no body, only desiring Dorus he would look well to the Princes Pamela.
Promising him mountains of his own labor, which nevertheless he little meant
to perform, like a fool not considering, that no man is to be moved with
part, that neglects the whole. Thus away went Damaetas, having already made an
image in his fancy, what Palaces he would build, how sumptuously he would
fare, and among all other things imagined Aristomenes graven upon it, and these
verses written in it.

A Banished man, long bard from his desire
By inward letts, of them his state possessed,
Hid here his hopes, by which he might aspire
To have his harms with wisdoms help redrest.
Seek then and see, what man esteems best,
All is but this, this is our labors hire,
Of this we live, in this we find our rest,
Who hold this fast no greater wealth require.
Look further then, so shall thou find at least,
A bait most fit, for hungr^e minded guest.
He opened the box, and to his great comfort read them, and with fresh courage
went about to lift up that stone. But in the mean time, ere Damaetas was half
a mile gone to the treasure ward, Dorus came to Miso, whom he found sitting in
the chimneys end, babbling to her self, and showing me all her gestures that
she was loathsomly weary of the world, not for any hope of a better life, but
finding Dorus set himself, and framed toward her, such a smiling
countenance, as might seem to be mixed between a tickled mirth, and a forced
pity. Miso, to whom cheerefulnes in others, was ever a sauce of Mopsa, to
see how this skip-iacke looks at me. Dorus that had the occasion he desired,
Truly mistress answered he, my smiling is not at you, but at them that are
from you, and in deed I must Miso that was never void of malice enough to
suspect the uttermost evil, to satisfye a further shrewdnes, took on a
present mildnes, and gently Dorus fell off from the matter again, as if he
had meant no such thing, till by much refusing her entreaty, and vehemently
stirring up her desire to know, he had strengthened a credit in her to that he
should say. And then with a formal countenance, as if the conscience
Mantinea, I happened upon the side of it, in a little falling of the ground which
was a rampie^ against the Suns rage, to perceive a young maid, truly of the
finest stamp of beawtie, and that which made her beauty the more admirable,
there was at all no art added to the helping of it. For her apparel was but
such as Shepherds daughters are wont to wear: and as for her ears, and so
open again the treasure of her perfections, which that for a while had in part
hidden. In her lap there lay a Shepherd, so wrapped up in that well liked
place, that I could discern no piece of his face, but as mine eyes were attent
in that, her Angellike voice struck mine ears with this song: MY true love
has my heart, and I have his,
By just exchange, one for the other giu'ne.
I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss:
There never was a better bargain driu'ne.
His heart in me, keeps me and him in one,
My heart in him, his thoughts and senses guides:
He loves my heart, for once it was his own:
I cherish his, because in me it bides.
His heart his wound received from my sight:
My heart was wounded, with his wounded heart,
For as from me, on him his hurt did light,
So still me thought in me his hurt did smart:

My true love has my heart and I have his.


But as if the Shepherd that lay before her, had been organes, which were only
to be blown by her breath, she had no sooner ended with the joining her sweet
lips together, but that he recorded to her music this rural poesy: O Words
which fall like summer deaw on me,
O breath more sweet, then is the growing bean,
O tongue in which, all honyed likoures b^e,
O voice that does, the Thrush in shrilnes stain,

That she is mine, as I to her am true.
Gay hair more gaie then straw when harvest lies,
Lips red and plum, as cherries ruddy side,
Eyes fair and great, like fair great oxes eyes,

Join you with me, to seal this promise due,
That she be mine, as I to her am true.
But thou white skin, as white as cruddes well pressed,

And thou dear flesh, as soft as wool new dressed,
And yet as hard, as brawne made hard by art:
First four but say, next fowr their saying seal,
But you must pay, the gage of promised weal.


And with the conclusion of his song, he embraced her about the knees, O sweet
Charita said he, when shall I enjoy the rest of my toyling thoughts? And when
shall your blisfull promise now due, be verified with just performance? with
that I drew nearer to them, and saw (for now he had lifted up his face to
glass himself in her fair eyes) that it was my master Damaetas, but here
Miso interrupted his tale, with railing at Damaetas, with all those exquisite
terms, which I was never good skolde enough to imagine. But Dorus, as if he
had been much offended with her impacie^ce, Damaetas, laying before her, his
great credit with the Duke, and withal giving her very fair presents, with
promise of much more, had in the end concluded together to meet as that
Mantinea, in the Oudemian street, at Charitas uncles house, about ten of the
clock. After which bargain Damaetas had spied Dorus, and calling him to him,
had with great bravery told him all his good hap, willing him in any case to
return to the old witch Miso (for so indeed mistress of liveliness, and
not of ill will he termed you) and to make some honest excuse of his absence,
for Charita, if thou did know what a life I lead with that driuell, it would
make thee even of pity, receive me into thy only comfort. Now Mistress said
he, exercise your discretion, which if I were well assured of, I would wish you
to go yourselfe to Mantinea, and (lying secret in some one of your gossypps
houses, till the time appointed come) so may you find them together, Miso,
then the praises Dorus gave to Charitas beauty, which made her iealosie swell
the more, with the poison of envy. And that being increased with the presents
she heard Damaetas had given her (which all seemed torn out of her bowels)
her hollow eyes, yielded such wretched looks, as one might Pluto at that time,
might have had her soul very good cheap. But when the fire of spite had fully
caught hold of all her inward parts, then whosoever would have seen the
picture of Alecto, or with what manner of countenance Medea killed her own
children, needed but take Miso for the full satisfaction of that point of his
knowledge. She that could before scarce go, but supported by crutches, Mantinea
she went, casting with her self, how she might couple shame with the
punishment of her accursed husband: but the person is not worthy in whose
passion I should too long stand. Therefore now must I tell you that Mistress
Mopsa (who was the last party Dorus was to practice his cunning withal) was at
the parting of her parents, attending upon the Princes Pamela, whom because she
found to be placed Mopsa with a right base nature (which joys to see any hard
hap happen to them, they deem happy) grow proud over her, and use great
ostentation of her own diligence, in prying curiously into each thing that
Pamela did. Neither is there any thing sooner ouerthrows a weak heart, then
opinion of authority, like too strong a liquor for Pamelas beauty, so far, that
often she would say to her self, if she had been borne a Duchess as well as
Pamela, her perfections then should have been as well seen as Pamelas, with
this manner of woman, and placed in these terms, had Dorus to play his last
part, which he would quickly have dispatched in tying her up in such a manner,
that she should little have hindered his enterprise. But that the virtuous
Pamela, (when she saw him so minded,) Dorus was compelled to take her in the
manner he first thought of, and accordingly Pamela sitting musing at the
strange attempt she had condiscended unto, and Mopsa hard by her, (looking in
a glass with very partial Dorus put himself between them, and casting up his
face to the top of the house, shrugging all over his body, and stamping
sometimes upon the ground, gave Mopsa occasion (who was as busy as a Be to
know any thing) to ask her lover Dorus what ayled him, that made him use so
strange a behavior, he, as if his spirits had been ravished with some
supernatural contemplation, stood still muett, sometimes Mopsa in such an
itche of inquiry, that she would have offered her maydenhead, rather then
belong kept from it. Dorus not yet aunswearing to the purpose, still keeping
his amazement. O Hercules, said he, resolve me in this doubt. A tree to grant
ones wishes? Is this the cause of the Kings solitary life? Which part shall
I take? Happy in either, unhappy Mopsa yet in a further longing of knowing
the matter, so that the pretty pigge, laying her sweet burden about his neck,
my Dorus, said she, tell me these words, or else I know not what will befall
me, honny Dorus tell them me. Dorus having stretched her mind upon a right
last, extremely loved Mopsa, said he, the Jupiter fallen out with Apollo had
thrown him out of heaven, taking from him the privilege of a God. So that
poor Apollo was feign to lead a very miserable life, unacquainted to work
Admetus heardman, he had upon occasion of fetching a certain breed of beasts
out of Arcadia, come to that very deserte, where wearied with travail, and
resting himself in the boughs of a pleasant Ash tree, stood little of from
the lodge, he had with pitiful complaints gotten his father Jupiters
pardon, and so from that tree was received Admetus he had granted a double
life, and because that tree was the chapel of his prosperous prayers, he had
given it this equality, that whatsoever of such estate, and in such manner as he
then was, sat down in that tree, they should obtain whatsoever they wished.
This Basilius having understood by the oracle, Dametas, making him swear he
should wish according to his direction. But because said Dorus, Apollo was at
that Admetus had given him, and because they that must wish must be muffled in
like sort, and with like stuff, my master Dametas is gone I know not whither
to provide him a skarlet cloak, and to morrow does appointe to return with
it, my Mistress I cannot tell how, having gotten some inckling of it, is
trudged to Mantinea to get her self a cloak before him: because she would
have the first wish. My master at his parting of great trust told me this
secret, commanding me to see no body should clime that tree. But now my
Mopsa, said he, I have here the like cloak of mine own Mopsa was to be in the
tree, and therefore without squeamishnes, promising all he would, she
coniured him by all her precious Loves, that she might have the first
possession of the wishing tree, assuring him that for the enjoying her he
should never need to clime far. Dorus to whom time was precious, made no
great ceremonies with her, but helping her up to the top Apollo, without making
at al any noise, till at the farthest within twelve hours space, she should
hear a voice call her by name three times, and that till the third time she
Mopsa, resolved in her heart, to be the greatest Lady of the world, and never
after to feed of worse then furmentie. Dorus having delivered his hands of his
three tormentors, took speedely the benefit of his devise, and mounting the
gracious Pamela upon a fair horse he had provided for her he thrust himself
forthwith into the wildest part of the desarte, where he had left marks to
guide him, from place to place to the next sea port, disguising her very fitly
with scarfes although he rested assured, he should meet that Pamela who all this
while, transported with desire and troubled with fear had never free scope of
judgment to look with perfect consideration into her own enterprise but eue^
by the laws of love, had bequeathed the care of her self upon him to whom she
had given her self. Now that the pang of desire with evident hope was quieted,
and Musidorus, (for so my assured hope is I may justly call you, since with no
other my heart would ever have yielded to go; And if so I do not rightly
term you, all other words are as bootelesse, Musidorus I say now that the
vehement shows of your faithful Love toward me, have brought my mind to
answer it, in so due a proportion, that contrary to all general rules of
reason, I have laid in you, my estate, my life, my honor: it is your part to
double your former care, and make me see your virtue no less in preserving
then in obtaining: and your faith to be a faith as much in freedom, as
bondage. Musidorus that had more abundance of joy in his heart, then Ulysses
Palladium, imagined to be the only relicke of Troies safety, taking Pamelas
hand, and many times kissing it. What I am said he, the Gods I hope will
shortly make your own eyes Judges; and of my mind toward you, the mean time
shall be my pledge unto you your contentment is dearer to me then mine own, and
therefore doubt not of his mind, whose thoughts Musidorus drew out such
provision of fruits, and other cates, as he had brought Pamela had much more
pleasure to walk under those trees, making in their barks pretty knottes,
which tied together the names of Musidorus and Pamela, sometimes entermixedly
changing there, to Pammedorus and Musimela, with twenty other flowers of her
trauiling fancies, which had bound them selves to a greater DO not disdain, o
straight up raised Pine

Since that my thoughts, as straight as streightnes thine
No smaller wound, alas! far deeper have.
Deeper engrau'd, which salve nor time can save,
Giu'ne to my heart, by my fore wounded eyne:
Thus cruel to my self how can thou crave
My inward hurt should spare thy outward rine^
Yet still fairetree, lift up thy stately line,
Live long, and long witness my chosen smarte,
Which barde desires, (barde by my self) imparte
And in this growing bark grow verses mine.
My heart my word, my word has giu'ne my heart.
The giver given from gift shall never part.


Upon a root of the tree, that the earth had left something barer then the
rest, she wrat this couplet: Sweet root say thou, the root of my desire
Was virtue cladde in constant loves attire.


Musidorus, seeing her fancies drawn up to such pleasant contemplations,
accompanied YOu goodly pines, which still with brave assent
In natures pride your heads to heau'nwarde heave,
Though you besides such graces earth has lent,
Of some late grace a greater grace receive,
By her who was (O blessed you) content,
With her fair hand, your tender barks to cleave,
And so by you (O blessed you) has sent,
Such pearcing words as no thoughts else conceive:
Yet yield your grant, a baser hand may leave
His thoughts in you, where so sweet thoughts were spent,
For how would you the mistress thoughts bereave
Of waiting thoughts all to her service meant?
Nay higher thoughts (though thralled thoughts) I call
My thoughts then hers, who first your ryne did rent.
Then hers, to whom my thoughts a lonely thrall
Rising from low, are to the highest bente;
Where hers, whom worth makes highest over all
Coming from her, cannot but downewarde fall.


While Pamela sitting her down under one of them, and making a posie of the
Musidorus ears with the heavenly sound of her music, which before he had
never heard, so that it seemed unto him a new assault given to the castle of
his heart, alredye conquered, which to signify and with all reply to her
sweet noates, he sang in a kind of still, but rauishing tune a few verses,
her song was this, and his Reply follows: Pamela. LIke diverse flowers, whose
diverse beauties serve
To deck the earth with his well-colourde weed,
Though each of them, his private form preserve,
Yet joining forms one sight of beauty breed.
Right so my thoughts, where on my heart I feed:
Right so my inward parts, and outward glass,
Though each possess a diverse working kind,
Yet all well knit to one fair end do pass:

All what I am, still one, his own, do find.

Musidorus. All what you are still one, his own to find,
You that are borne to be the worlds eye,

And to the sun with waxen wings to fly?
No no, such force with my small force to try
Is not my skill, or reach of mortal mind.

Hold me most yours, then my long suite is signde.
You none can claim but you your self aright,
For you do pass your self, in virtues might.

You only yours, too far beyond desarte.



In this virtuous wantonness, suffering their minds to descend to each tender
enjoying their united thoughts, Pamela, having tasted of the fruits, and
growinge extreme Lock up, fair liddes, the treasure of my heart:

To her sweet sense, sweet sleep some ease imparte,
Her sense too weak to bear her spirits might.
And while o sleep thou closest up her sight,

o harbor all her parts in easefull plighte:
Let no strange dreme make her fair body start^.
But yet o dream, if thou will not depart
In this rare subject from the common right:
But wilt thy self in such a seat delighte,
Then take my shape, and play a lovers part:
Kiss her from me, and say unto her spirit,
Till her eyes shine, I live in darkest night.


The sweet Pamela, was brought into a sweet sleep with this song which gave
Musidorus opportunity at leisure to behold her excellent beauties. He thought
her Musidorus affectes that he was compelled to put his face as low to hers,
as he could, Camaeleons if he might be suffered to enjoy that food. But
long he was not suffered being within a while interrupted by the coming of a
company of clownish vilaines, armed with diverse sorts of weapons, and for the
rest both in face and apparel so forewasted that they seemed to bear a great
conformity with the savages; Pamela, and made Musidorus turn unto them full of
a most violent rage, with the look of a she Tigree, when her whelps are
stolen away.

But Zelmane whom I left in the Cave hardly bestead, having both great wits
Hope then (the only succor of perplexed minds) being quite cut off, you
desire my affection, and yet you your self think my affection already
bestowed. You pretend cruelty, before you have the subjection, and are jealous
of keeping that, which as yet you have not gotten. And that which is strangest
in your jealousy, is Gynaecia, to whom the fearful agonies she still lived
in made any small repriuall sweet, did quickly find her words falling to a
better way of comfort, and therefore with a mind ready to show nothing could
make it rebellious against Zelmane, but to extreme tyranny, she thus said:
Alas too much beloved Zelmane, the Zelmane that already saw some fruit of
her last determined fancy (so far as came to a mollifyeng of Gynecias rage)
seeing no other way to satisfye suspicion, which was help open with Philoclea.
For how could I ever imagine, the heavens would have rayned down so much of
your favor upon me? and of that side there was a show of possible hope, the
most comfortable Counselor of love. The cause of this my changed attire, was
a journey two years ago I made among the Amazons, where having sought to try
my unfortunate valor, I met not one in all the Country but was too hard for
me, till in the end in the presence of their Queen Marpesia, I hoping to
prevail against her, challenged an old woman of fourscore years, to fight
on horssebacke Amazon, till the coming of my beard did, with the discharge of
my oath, deliver me of that bondage. Here Zelmane ended, not coming to a full
conclusion, because she would see what it wrought in Gynecias mind, having in
her speech sought to win a belief Gynecias affection. For the first it had
much prevailed. But Gynecia whose end of loving her, was not her fighting,
neither could her love too deeply grounded receive diminishment; and besides
she had seen herself, sufficient proofs of Zelmanes admirable prowess.
Therefore slightly passing over that point of her feigned dishonor, but taking
Zelmane, tread not upon a soul that lies under your foot: let not the abasing
of my self make me more base in your eyes, but judge of me according to that I
am and have Zelmanes heart had not been so fully possessed as there was no place
left for any new guest, no doubt it would have yielded to that gallant assault.
But Zelmane so much the more arming her determination, as she saw such force
Gynecia, and once or twice kissing her, Dear Lady, said she, he were a great
enemy to himself, that would refuse such an offer, in the purchase of which a
man's life were blessedly bestowed. Nay, how can I ever yield due recompense,
for so excessive a favor? but having nothing to give you but my Amazons, since
that dishonor has been so true a path to my greatest honor, and the changing
of my outward raiment, has clothed my mind in such inward contentacion. Take
therefore noble Lady as much comfort to your heart, as the full commandment
of me can yield you: wipe your fair eyes, and keep them for nobler services.
And now I will presume thus much to say unto you, that you make of your self
for my sake, that my joys of Gynecia out of the Cave, for well she saw the
boiling mind of Gynecia did easily apprehende the fitness of that lonely
place. But in deed this direct promise of a short space, joined with the
cumbersome familiar of womankinde, I mean modesty, stayed so Gynecias mind,
that she took thus much at that present for good payment: remaining with a
paynefull joy, and a wearysome kind of comfort, not unlike to the condemned
prisoner, whose mind Gynecia already half persuaded in her self (o weakness
of humane conceit) that Zelmanes affection was turned toward her. For such
alas! we are all, in such a mould are we cast, that with the too much love we
bear our

But Zelmane who had now to play her prize, seeing no way things could long
remain in that state, and now finding her promise had tied her trial to a
small compass of time, began to throw her thoughts into each corner
Basilius, who then lying down by his daughter Philoclea, Hemisphere, his
inward Muses made him in his best music, sing this Madrigall.


O Titan fair the giver of the day?
Is it to carry news
To Western wightes, what stars in East appear?
Or do thou think that hear

Yet stay and well peruse,
What be her gifts, that make her equal thee,
Bend all thy light to see
In earthly clothes enclosde a heavenly spark.

No, no, thy motions be
Hastened from us with bar of shadow dark,
Because that thou the author of our sight
Disdainst we see thee staind with others light.
And having ended, Dear Philoclea, said he, sing something that may diuerte my
thoughts from the continual task of their ruinous harbor: She obedient to
him, O Stealing time the subject of delaie,
(Delay, the rack of vnrefram'd desire)
What strange dessein have thou my hopes to stay
My hopes which do but to mine own aspire?
Mine own? o word on whose sweet sound does pray
My greedy soul, with gripe of inward fire:
Thy title great, I justly challenge may,
Since in such phrase his faith he did attire.
O time, become the chariot of my joys:
As thou drawest on, so let my bliss draw near.
Each moment lost, part of my hap destroys:
Thou art the father of occasion dear:
Join with thy son, to ease my long annoy's.
In speedy help, thank worthy friends appear.


Philoclea brake off her Song, as soon as her mother with Zelmane came near
unto them, rising up with a kindly bashfulnes, being not ignorant of the spite
her mother bare her, and stricken with the sight of that person, whose love
made all those troubles, seem fair flowers of her dearest garlond, Nay rather
all those troubles, made the love increase. For as the arrival of enemies,
makes a town so Philoclea see, the Zelmanes affection toward her; she
thought she saw an other light in her eyes, with a bold and careless look
upon her which was wont to be dazeled with her beawtie; and the framing of her
courtesyes rather ceremonious then affectionate, and that which worst liked
her, was, that it proceeded with such quiet setlednes, as it rather threatened a
full purpose, then any sudden passion. Philoclea into a new trauers Zelmanes
behavior, who in deed (though with much pain, and condemning her self to
commit a sacrilege, against the sweet saint that lived in her in most
Temple) yet strengthening herself in it, being the surest way to make
Gynecia bite off her other baytes, did so quite ouerrule all wonted shows of
love to Philoclea, and convert them to Gynecia, that the part she Gynecia,
such excessive comfort, as the being preferred to a rival does deliver to
swelling desire: But to the delicate Philoclea, whose calm thoughts were
unable to nourish any strong debate, it gave so stinging a hurt, that fainting
under the force of her inward torment, she withdrewe her self to the Lodge,
and there wearye

Philoclea, is this the price of all thy pains? Is this the reward of thy
given away liberty? Has too much yielding bred crueltye? or can too great
acquaintance, make me held for a stranger? Has the choosing of a companion,
made me left alone? or does granting desire, cause the desire to be
neglected? Alas, despised Philoclea, why did thou not hold thy thoughts
Philoclea his thoughts should rest? Ah silly soul that could please thy
self with ^o impossible an imagination! An universal happiness is to flow
from him. How was I so inueagled to Philoclea, he did thee no wrong, it was thy
weakness to fancy the beams of the son should give light to no eyes but
thine! And yet, o Prince Pirocles, for whom I may well begin to hate my self,
but can never leave to love thee, what triumph can thou make of this
conquest? what spoils will thou carry away of this my undeserved Pirocles,
Pirocles, let me yet call thee before the judgment of thine own virtue, let
me be accepted for a plaintiff in a cause which concerns my life: what need
had to take on the habit of weak womankinde? Was all this to win the
undefended Castle of a friend, which being won, thou would after raze?
Could so small a cause allure thee? or did not so unjust a cause stop thee? o
me, what say I more, this is my case, my love hates me, virtue deals wickedly
with me, and he does me wrong, whose doing I can never account wrong. With that
the sweet Lady turning Gynecia had written this song, what time Basilius
imputed her jealous motions to proceed of the doubt she had of his untimely
loves. Under which veil she contented to cover her never ceassing anguish, had
made the Lute a monument of her mind, which Philoclea had never much marked,
till now the fear of a competitour

MY Lute which in thy self thy tunes enclose,
Thy mistress song is now a sorrow's cry,
Her hand benumde with fortunes daily blows,
Her mind amaz'de can neithers help apply.
Wear these my words as mourning weed of woes,
Black incke becommes the state wherein I dye.
And though my mones be not in music bound,
Of written greefes, yet be the silent ground.
The world does yield such ill consorted shows,
With circkled course, which no wise stay can try,
That childish stuff which knows not friends from foes,
(Better despisde) bewondre gasing eye.
Thus noble gold, down to the bottom goes,
When worthless cork, aloft does floting lie.
Thus in thy self, least strings are loudest found,
And lowest stops do yield the highest sound.
Philoclea read them, and throwing down the Lute, is this the legacy you have
bequeathed me, O kind mother of mine said she? did you bestow the light upon
me for this? or did you bear me to be the Author of my burial? A trim
purchase you have made of your own shame; robbed your daughter to ruin your
self! The birds unreasonable, yet use so much reason, as to make nestes for
their tender Gynecia reck that, neither But o you that have ever known, how
tender to every motion love makes the lovers heart, how he measures all his
joys upon her contentment: and does with respectful eye hang al his behavior
upon her eyes, judge I pray you now of Zelmanes troubled thoughts, when she saw
Philoclea, with an amazed kind of sorrow, carry away Zelmane did, now that
she was forced by reason, to give Philoclea might conceive, did wound her
soul, each tear she doubted she spent, drowned all her comfort. Her sickness
was a death unto her. Often would she speak to the image of Philoclea, which
lived and ruled in the highest of her inward part, and use vehement oaths
Pyrocles heart, for as for her she had no more interest in it to bestow it any
way: Alas would she say only Philoclea have thou not so much feeling of
thine own force, as to know no new conqueror can prevail against thy
conquestes? Was ever any daseled with Philoclea Philoclea, be thou but as
merciful a Princess to my mind, as thou art a true possessour, and I shall
have as much cause of gladness as thou have no cause of misdoubting. O no no,
when a man's own heart is the gage Zelmanes doubtful imaginations, in the end
reason well backed with the vehement desire, to bring her matters soon to the
desired haven, did over rule the boiling of her inward kindness, though Basilius
and Gynecias well waiting eyes, had marked her muses had labored in deeper
subject, then ordinary, which she likewise perceauing they had perceived, a
waking her self out of those thoughts, and principally caring how to
satisfy Gynecia (whose judgment and passion she stood most in regard of)
bowing her head to her attentive ear, Madame said she, Gynecia delivering in
her face as thankful a ioyfulnes, as her heart could hold, said it was then
time to retire themselves to their rest, for what, with riding abroad the day
before, and late sitting up for Egloges, their bodies had dearly purchased
that nights quiet. So went they home to their lodge, Zelmane framing of both
sides bountiful measures of loving countenaunces to eithers joy, and neythers
jealousy; to the especial comfort of Basilius, whose weaker bowels were
straight full with the least liquour of hope. So that still holding her by the
hand, and sometimes tickling it, he went by her with the most gay conceates
that ever had entered his brains, growing now so hearted in his resolucion, that
he Gynecias presence. But with a lustier note then wonted, clearing his voice,
and chearing his spirits, looking still upon Zelmane (whom now the moon did
beautify with her shining almost at the full) as if her eyes had been his
song book, he did the message of his mind in singing these verses: When two
Suns do appear
Some say it does betoken wonders near
As Princes loss or change:
Two gleaming Suns of splendor like I see,
And seeing feel in me
Of Princes heart quite lost the ruin strange.
But now each where does range
With ouglie cloak the dark envious night:
Who full of guilty spite,
Such living beams should her black seat assail,
Too weak for them our weaker sight does veil.
No says fair moon, my light
Shall bar that wrong; and though it not prevail
Like to my brothers raise, yet those I send
Hurt not the face, which nothing can amend.


And by that time being come to the lodge, and visited the sweet Philoclea,
with much less then natural care of the parents, and much less then wonted
kindenes of Zelmane, each party full fraught with diversely working fancies,
made their pillowes weak proppes of their over laden heads. Yet of all other
were Zelmanes brains most tormoyled, troubled with love both active and
passive; and lastely and Zelmane having had the night her only counselor in
the busy enterprise she was to undertake, and having all that time mused, and
yet not fully resolved, how she might join prevailing with preventing, was
offended with the days bold entry into her chamber, Auroras chardge with
these well song verses.

Aurora now thou shewst thy blushing light
(Which often to hope lays out a guilefull bait,
That trusts in time, to find the way aright
To ease those pains, which on desire do wait)
Blush on for shame: that still with thee do light
On pensive souls (in steed of restfull bait)
Care upon care (in steed of doing right)
To over pressed breasts, more grievous weight.
As oh! my self, whose woes are never light
(Tide to the stake of doubt) strange passions bait,
While thy known course, observing natures right
Sturres me to think what dangers lie in wait.
For mischeefes great, day after day does show:
Make me still fear, thy fair appearing show.
Alas said she, am not I run into a strange gulf, that am feign for love to
hurt Philoclea, whose beauty is matched with nothing, but with the
unspeakable beauty of thy fairest mind, if thou did see upon what a rack
my tormented soul is set, little would you think I had any scope now, to
leap to any new change, with that, with hasty hands she got her self up
turning her sight to every thing, as if change of Basilius hoping that her
dividing her self from them, might yet give him some freer Gynecia of all
other most joyous, holding her self assured that this was but a prologue to
the play she had promised her. Thus both flattering them selves, with diversely
grounded hopes, they rang a bell which served to call certain poor women
which ever lay in cabins not far off, to do the household Zelmanes bed and
furniture of her chamber, into the pleasant Cave; and to deck it up as
finely, as it was possible for them, That their souls rest might rest her
body to her best pleasing manner, that was with all diligence performed of them,
and Zelmane alredie in possession of her new chosen Vestaes nuns, entertaind
herself for a few days in all show of streightnes, yet once a day coming
to do her duty to the King and Queen, in whom the seldomnes of the sight
increased the more unquiet longing, though somewhat qualified, as her
countenance was decked to either of them with more comfort then wonted.
Especially to Gynecia who seeing her wholly neglecting Philoclea, had now promisd
her self a full possession of Zelmanes heart, still expecting the fruit, of
the happy and hoped for invention. But both she and Basilius kept such a
continual watch about the Precincts of the Cave, that either of them was a bar
to the other from having any secret, commoning with Zelmane. While in the mean
time the sweet Philoclea forgotten of her father, despised of her mother, and
in appearance left of Zelmane had yielded up her soul to be a pray to sorrow
and unkindness, not with raging conceit of revenge as had passed through the
stout and wise heart of her mother, but with a kindly meeknes taking upon her
the weight Zalmane, without expressing (more then she would) how far now her
love, was imprisoned in extremity of sorrow, she bound her self first to the
limits of her own chamber, and after, (grief breeding sickness) of her bed. But
Zelmane having now Musidorus and bring both their forces, so to win her. But
lastly even the same day that Musidorus by feeding the humor Pamela (whether it
were that love meant to match them every way, or that her friends example had
helped her invention, or that indeed Zelmane forbear to practice her devise
till she found her friend had passed through his.) The same day, I say, she
resolved on a way to rid out of the lodge her two combersome lovers, and in the
night to carry away Philoclea: where unto she was assured her own love, no
less then her sisters, would easily win her consent. Hoping that although
their abrupt parting had not suffered her to demand of Musidorus which way he
meant to direct his journey) yet either they should by some good fortune, find
him: or if that course failed, yet they might well recover some town of the
Helotes, near the frontie^es of Arcadia, Persians were aunciently wont, to
Zelmane encou^tred their eyes, with her beloved presence, but that it bred a
kind of burning devotion in the^, yet so much the more glading their gredy
souls, as her countenance were cleared with morefauour unto the^, which
Zelmanes eye, was a discourses, as lovers are wont to cover their passions in,
when respect of a third person keeps them from plain particulars, at the
earnest entreatie of Basilius, Zelmane, first saluting the muses with a base
voyal hong hard by her, sent this ambassade in versified music, to both her
ill requited lovers.

Beauty has force to catch the humane sight.
Sight does bewitch, the fancy evil awaked.
Fancy we feel, encludes all passions might,
Passion rebelde, often re^sons strength has shaked.
No wondre then, though sight my sight did tainte,
And though thereby my fancy was infected,
Though (yoked so) my mind with sickness fainte,
Had reasons weight for passions ease rejected.
But now the fit is past: and time has giu'ne
Leisure to weigh what due deserte requires.
All thoughts so spronge, are from their dwelling dri^'n,
And wisdom to his wonted seat aspireth.

Things rightly prizde, love is the band of love.
And after her song with an affected modesty, she threw down her eye, as
if the conscience of a secret grant her inward mind made, had suddenly cast
a bashful Basilius finding, and thinking now was the time, to urge his
painful petition, beseeching his wife with more careful eye to accompany
his sickly daughter Philoclea, being rid for that time of her, who was content
to grant him any scope, that she might after have the like freedom, with a
gesture governed by the force of his passions, making his knees his best
supporters he thus said unto

If either, said he, O Lady of my life, my deadly pangues could bear delay
or that this were the first time the same were manifested unto you, I would
now but maintain still the remembrance of my misfortune, without urging any
further reward, then time and pity might procure for me. But, alas, since my
martyrdom is Zelmane who had fully set to her self the train she would
keep, yet knowing that who soonest means to yield does well to make the
brauest parley, keeping countenance alofte. Noble prince said she, your words
are to well couched, to come out of a restless mind, and thanked be the Gods
your face threatens no danger of death. These are but those swelling speeches,
which give the uttermost name to every trifle, which all were worth nothing,
if they were not enammeled with the goodly outside of love. Truly love were
very unlovely, if it were half fo deadly, Basilius,

In deed answered Zelmane, if I should grant to your request, I should show,
an example in my self that I esteem the holy band of chastity to be but
and Imaginatife Zelmanes grave, become her marriage bed, before my soul shall
consent to his own shame, before I will leave a mark in my self of an
vnredemable trespass. And yet must I confess that if Basilius look for at my
hands) I know not how you Basilius whose small sails the least wind did
fill, was forth with as far gonne into a large promising him self his
desire, as before he was stricken down with a threatened devil. And therefore
bending his brows as though he were not a man to take the matter as he had
done, what said he, shall my wife self against me. And with that he walked
up and down, nodding his head, as though they mistook him much that thought
he was not his wives master. But Zelmane now seeing it was time to conclude,
of your wisdom and manhood said she, I doubt not, but that suffices not me,
for both they can hardly ^ame a malicious Basilius that was old enough to
know, that women are not wont to appoint secreat night meetings for the
purchasing of land, holding himself already an undoubted possessour of his
desires, kissing her hand, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, as if the
greatness of the benefit did go beyond Zelmane went from him, saying she would
leave him to the remembrance of their appointment, and for her she would go
visit the Lady Philoclea, into whose chamber being come, keeping still her
late taken on gravity, and asking her how she did, Ginaecia, led her into a
baye window of the same Chamber, determining in her self, not to utter to so
excellent a wit as Gynaecia had, the uttermost point of her pretended devise,
but to keep the clause of it for the last instant, when the shortness o^ the
Philoclea, she began with more credible then eloquent speech to tell her, that
with much consideracion of a matter so nearly importing her own fancy, and
Gynaecias honor, she had now Philoclea, and then fayning your self not well
Thisbe did the toomuch loving and toomuch loved Piramus. The blood that
quickly ca^e into Ginecias fair face, was the only answer she made, but
that one might easily see, contentment Zelmane fast by the hand, cloasing her
eyes, and letting her head fall, as if she would give her to know, she was not
ignorant of her fault, although she were transported with the violence of her
evil. But in this triple agreement did the day seem tedious of all sides,
till his never erring course, had given place to the nights succession: And
the supper by each hand hasted, was with no less speed ended, when Gynecia
presenting a heavy sleepines in her countenance, brought up both Basilius and
Zelmane to see Philoclea still keeping her bed, and Zelmane wishing easefull
rest to Philoclea, did seem to take that nights leave of this princely crewe,
when Gynecia likewise seeming somewhat deseased, desired Basilius to stay a
while with her daughter, while she rocommended her sickness to her beds comfort,
in deed desirous to determine Basilius, who the sooner she was asleep, the
sooner hoped to come by his long pursued pray. Thus both were bent to deceive
each other, and to take the advantage of either others disadvantage. But
Gyneacia having taken Zelmane into her bedchamber, to speak a little with her
of their sweet determinacion: Zelmane upon a sudden Damaetas house see you,
they may think you to be my self, and I will presently lie down in your
place, so muffled for your supposed sickness, as the King shall nothing know
me. And then as soon as he is a sleep, will Gynaecia any space to take the
full image of this new change into her fancy. But seeing no ready objection
against it in her heart, and knowing that Zelmane, nimbly disarayeng her self,
possess Gynaecias place, hiding her head in such a close manner, Zelmanes
utmost apparel, went first into her closet, there quickly to beawtifie her
self, with the best and sweetest night deckings. But there, casting an hasty
eye over her precious things, which ever since Zelmanes coming, her head
otherwise occupied had left unseen, Let him drink this, whom long in arms
to fold
Thou do desire, and with free power to hold.


She remembered the bottle, for it had been kept of long time by the Kings of
Cyprus, as a thing of rare virtue, and given to her by her mother, when she
being very young married to her husband of much greater age, her mother
persuaded it was of property to force love, with love effects, had made a
precious present of it to this her beloved child, though it had been received
rather by tradition to have such a quality, then by any approved experiment.
This Gynaecia, (according to the Zelmane. She that before would not have gone
so far, especially by night, and to so dark a place, now took a pride in
the same courage, and framed in her mind a pleasure out of the pain it self.
Zelmane had done: whose pillow she kissed a thousand times, for having borne the
print of that beloved head. And so keeping, with panting heart, her traveling
fancies so attentive, that the wind could stir nothing, but that she stirred
herself, as if it had been the pace of the longed-for Zelmane, she kept her
side of the bed; defending only and cherishing the other side with her arm,
till after a while waiting, counting with her self how many steps were betwixt
the Lodge and the Cave, and often accusing Zelmane of more curious stay then
needed, she was visited with an unexpected guest.

For Basilius, after his wife was departed to her feigned repose, as long as he
remained Philoclea ministered unto him, with a sudden starting, and casting up
his head, make an answer far out of all Grammar: a certain deep musing,
and by and by out of it: uncertain motions, unstayed graces. Having borne out
the limit of a reasonable time with as much pain as might be, he came
darkeling into his chamber, forcing himself Pan did, when, in stead of Ioles
bed, he came into the rough imbracings of Hercules: and laying himself
down, as tenderly as a new Bride, rested a while with a very open ear, to
mark each breath of his supposed wife. And sometimes he himself would yield a
long fetched sigh, as though that had been a music to draw one another to
sleep, till within a very little while, with the other parties well
counterfeyt sleep (who was as willing to be rid of him, as he was to be gone
thence) assuring himself he left all safe there, in the same order stale out
again, Basilius go to her whom he fled, and with much cunning left the
person for whom he had employed all his cunning. But when Basilius was once
gotten (as he thought) into a clear coast what joy he

GEt hence foul Grief, the canker of the mind:
Farewell Complaint, the misers only pleasure:
Away vain Cares, by which few men do find
Their sought-for treasure.
Ye helpless Sighs, blow out your breath to naught,
Tears, drown your selves, for woe (your cause) is wasted,
Thought, think to end, too long the fruit of thought
My mind has tasted.
But thou, sure Hope, tickle my leaping heart.
Comfort, step thou in place of wonted sadness.
Fore-felt Desire, begin to savor parts
Of coming gladness.
Let voice of Sighs into clear music run,
Eyes, let your Tears with gazing now be mended,
Instead of Thought, true pleasure be begun,
And never ended.
Thus imagining as then with himself, his joys so held him up, that he never
touched ground. And, like a right old beaten soldier, that knew well enough
the greatest Captains do never use long Orations, when it commes to the very
point of execution, as soon as he was gotten into the Cave, and to the joyful
(though silent) expectation of Gynaecia, come close to the bed, never recking
his promise Gynaecia: O Zelmane, said he, embrace in your favor this humble
servant of yours: hold within me my heart, which pantes to leave his master to
come unto you. In what case poor Gynaecia was, when she knew the voice, and
felt the body of her husband, fair Ladies, with the doubt that Zelmane had
betrayed her to her husband, besides the renewed sting of iealosie, what in the
mean time might befall her daughter. But of the other side, her love, with a
fixed persuasion she had, taught her to seek all reason of hopes. And therein
thought best before discovering of her self, to mark Zelmane, made Gynaecia
hope that this might be Basilius own enterprise, which Zelmane had not stayed,
least she should discover the matter which might be performed at another time.
Which hope accompanied with Basilius manner of dealing, (he being at that time
fuller of liuelier fancies, then many years Zelmane, all coming together into
her mind, which was loath to condemn it self of an utter overthrow, made her
frame her self, not truly with a sugared joy, but with a determinate patience
to let her husband think he had found a very gentle and supple-minded Zelmane;
which he

But Pyrocles who had at this present no more to play the part of Zelmane,
having so naturally measured the manner of his breathing, that Basilius made no
doubt of his sound sleeping, and layne a preatie while with a quiet unquietness
to perform Basilius shinnes and the vnregarding fourmes he perceived that he
had fully left the Lodge: after him went he with stealing steps, having his
sword under his arm (still doubting least some mischance might turn Basilius
back again) down to the gate of the Lodge. Which not content to lock fast,
he barred and fortified with as many devises, Philoclea, and conueying her to
her horse, before any might come in to find them missing. For further ends of
those ends, and what might ensue of this action, his love and courage well
matched never looked after, houlding for an assured ground, that whosoever in
great things will think to prevent Philocleas chamber door went Pyrocles, rapt
from himself with the excessive fore-feeling of his (as he assured himself)
near coming contentment. What ever pains he had taken, what dangers he had
run into, and especially those saucy pages of love, doubts, griefs,
languishing Pella, among the exceeding joys of his father, and infinite
congratulacions of his friends, Philoclea, and for sumptuous shows and
triumphs against their marriage. In the thought whereof as he found extremity of
joy, so well found he that extremity is not without a certain joyful pain,
by extending the heart beyond his wonted limits, and by so forcible a holding
all the senses to one object, that it confounds their mutual working, not
without a charming kind of rauishing them, from the free use of their own
function. Thus grieved only with too much gladness, being come to the door,
which should be the entry to his happiness, he was met with the latter end of a
song, which Philoclea

Virtue1, beawtie2, and speech3, did strike1, wound2, charm3,
My heart1, eyes2, ears3, with wonder1, love2, delight3:
First1, second2, last3, did bind1, enforce2, and arm3,
His works1, shows2, suites3, with wit1, grace2, and vow's3 might.
Thus honor1, liking2, trust3, much1, far2, and deep3,
Held1, pearst2, possessed3, my judgment1, sense2, and will3,
Till wrong1, contempt2, deceit3, did grow1, steal2, creep3,
Bands1, favor2, faith3, to break1, defile2, and kill3.
Then grief1, unkindness2, proof3, took1, kindled2, tought3,
Well1 grounded, noble2, due3, spite1, rage2, disdain3,
But1 ah2, alas3! (In vain) my mind1, sight2, thought3,
Does him1, his face2, his words3, leave1, shun2, refrain3,
For no thing1, time2, nor place3, can loose1, quench2, ease3,
Nine own1, embraced2, sought3, knot1, fire2, desease3.
The force of love to those poor folk that feel it, is many ways very
strange, seen in the given over Pyrocles, who with panting breath, and sometime
sighs, not such as sorrow restrayning the inward parts does make them glad
to deliver, but such as the impacience of delay, with the vnsuretie of never so
sure hope, is wont to breath out now being at the door, of the one side,
hearing her voice, which he Pyrocles I say was stopped with the violence of
so many darts, cast by Cupid Philocleas pitiful accusing of him forced him
to bring his spirits again, to a new bias, for she laying her hand under
her fair cheek, upon which there did privily tickle the sweet Pyrocles said
she, deserved thus much of me, that I should for his sake lift up my voice in
my best tunes, and to him continually, with pouring out my plainte, make a
di^dayned oblacion? Shall my soul still do this honor to his unmercifully
tirranie, by my lamenting his loss, to show Philoclea, he hears thee not; and
if he did, some hearts grow the harder, the more they find their advantage.
Alas what a miserable constitution of mind have I! I disdain my fortune, and
yet reverence him that disdaines me. I accuse his ungratefulness, and have his
virtue in admiration. O ye deaf heavens, I would either his injury could blot
out mine affection, THe love which is imprinted in my soul

With inward cries putts up a bitter role
Of huge complaints, that now it is despis'de.
Thus thus the more I love, the wrong the more

Wrong sturres remorsed grief, griefs deadly sore
Unkindness breeds, unkindness fostreth has.
But ah the more I hate, the more I think

The more his matchless gifts do deeply sinck
Into my breast, and loves renewed swim.
What medicin then, can such desease remove
Where love draws hate, and hate engenders love?


But Pyrocles that had heard his name accused, and condemned by the mouth which
of all the world, and more then all the world^ he most loved: had then cause
enough to call his mind to his home, and with the most haste he could (for
true love fears AEolus sent out winds upon the trojan relics, guided upon
the sea by the valiant AEneas, he went into her chamber with such a pace as
reverent fear does teach, where kneeling down, and having prepared a long
discourse for her, his eyes Zelmane or Pyrocles, (for whether name I use it
much skils not, by the one I was first deceived, and by the other now betrayed)
what strange motion is the guide of thy cruel mind hither? Pyrocles, Pyrocles
for thine own virtues sake, let miseries be no music unto thee, and be
content to take to thy self some color of excuse, that thou did not know
to what extremity thy inconstancy, or rather falsehood has brought me.
Pyrocles to whom every syllable she pronounced, was a thunderboult to you fear
for your sake, do not you destroy me for their sake what can I without you
further do? Or to what more forwardnes can any counsel bring our desired
happiness? I have provided whatsoever is needful for our going, I have rid them
both out of the lodge, so that there is none here to be hinderers or knowers
of our Philoclea. Pyrocles form, as you have done in Zelmanes? Or rather now
you have betrayed me in both, is some third sex left you, into which you can
transform your self to inueigle my simplicity? Enjoy, enjoy the conquest
you have already wone: and assure your self you are come to the farthest
point of your cunning. Pyrocles, my only defense shall be belief of nothing, my
comfort my faithful innocence, and the punishment I desire of you shall be
your own conscience. Philocleas hard perseuering in this unjust condemnation
of him, did so overthrow all the might of Pyrocles mind (who saw that time
would not serve to prove by deeds, and that the better words he used, the
more they were suspected Philoclea? She that little looked for Venus rising from
her mother the sea, not so much stricken down with amazement, and grief of her
fault, as lifted up with the force of love and desire to help, she laid her
fair body over his breast, and throwing no other water in his face, but the
stream of her tears nor giving him other blows but the kissing of her
welformed mouth, her only Philoclea, had thou thrown away the Jewel wherein
all thy pride consisted? Have thou with too much have ouerrun utterly left
this most sweet mansion, before I follow thee with Thisbes punishment for my
rash unwariness, hear this protestation of mine: That as the wrong I have
done thee proceeded of a most sincere, but irresistable affection: so led with
this pitiful example it shall end in the mortal hate of my self, and (if
it may be) I will make my soul a tomb of thy memory. At that word with
anguish of mind and Pyrocles then first seuering his eye liddes, and quickly
apprehending her danger, to him more then death, beyond all powers striving to
recover the commandment of al his powers, stayed her from falling: and then,
lifting the sweet burden of her body in his arms, laid her again Pyrocles
had to deliver. But he lying down on the bed by her, holding her hand in his,
with so kind an accusing her of unkindness, as in accusing her he condemned
himself, began from point to point to discover unto her all that had passed
between his loathed lovers and him. How he had entertained, and by entertaining
deceived, both Basilius and Gynecia: Macedon, and al other Euarchus dominions
might yield him, especially since in this enterprise he had now waded so far,
as he could not possibly retire himself back, without being overwhelmed with
danger and disho^our. He neded not have Pyrocles, she had condiscended to go
with him. But raising her self a little in her bed, and finding her own
inability in any sort to endure the air: My Pyrocles Pyrocles thoughts from
expecting further answer, to the necessary care of reviving her, in whose
fainting himself was more the^ ouerthrown. And that having effected with all the
sweet mea^s his wits could devise, though his highest hopes were by this
unexpected downfall sunk deeper the^ any degree of despair: yet lest the
appeara^ce of his inward grief might occasion her further disco^fort, having
racked Philoclea, whose consideration was limited by his words, and whose
conceit pierced no deeper then his outward countenance, wrought within a
while such quietness of mind, and that quietness again such repose of body,
that sleep by his harbingers weakness, wearines, and watchfulnes, had quickly
taken up his lodging in all her senses. Then indeed had Pyrocles leisure to sit
in judgment Philoclea with his purpose or being made acquainted with her
present estate, had fallen headlong into that attempt, the success whereof he
had long since set down to himself as the measure of all his other fortunes.
But calling to mind how weakly they do that Gynecia bewraied not the matter
(which he thought she would not do, as well for her own honor and safety,
as for the hope she might still have of him, which is loath to die in a lovers
heart) all the rest might turn to a preatie meryment, and inflame his lover
Basilius, again to cast about for the missed favor. And as naturally the
heart stuffed up with wofulnes is glad greedelie to suck the Philoclea, that
their necks were subject each to others chaste embracements, it seemed love
had come thither to lay a plott in that picture of death how gladly, if death
came, their souls would go together.


THyrsis not with many painted words nor falsified promises, had wone the
consent of his beloved Kala, but with a true and simple making her know he
loved her not forcing himself beyond his reach to buy her affection, but
giving her Kala thus poesies of the spring flowers were wrapped up in a little
grene silk and dedicated to Kalas breasts, thus sometimes his sweetest Cream,
sometimes the best Cakebread his mother made, were reserved for Kalas taste.
Neither would he silence when she would not: in going to Church great worship
to Kala. So that all the parish said, never a maid they knew so well waited
on: and when dancing was about the Maypole, no body taken out but she, and he
after a leap or two to show her his own actiuitie, would frame all the rest
of his dancing, only to grace her. As for her fathers sheep, he had no less
care of them then his own: so Thyrsis carefulnes. But if he spied Kala favored
any one of the flock more then his fellows, then that was cherished: shearing
him so (when shorn he must be) as might most become him: but while the wole
was on, wrapping within it ^^me verses, wherein Thyrsis had a special gift,
and making the innocent beast his vnweting messinger. Thus constantly Kalas
heart, the honestest wenche in all those quarters. And so with consent of both
parents (without which nether Thyrsis would ask, nor Kala grant) their marring
day was appointed, which because it fell out in this time, I think it shall
not be impertinent, to remember a little our shepherds, while the other
greater persons, are either sleeping Thyrsis marriage time once known, there
needed no inuiting of the neighbors in that valley, for so well was Thyrsis
beloved, that they were already to do him credit, neither yet came they like
Harpies to devour him: but on bought a fat pigge, the other a tender kidd, the
third a great goose: as for chese, milk, and butter, were the gossips
presents. Thither came of strange shepherds only Philisides, ^or the virtuous
Coridon had long since left off al his joyful solemnities. And as for Strephon
and Klaius, they had lost their mistress, which put them into such extreme
sorrows as they could scarcely abide the light of the day, much less the
eyes of men. But of the Arcadian borne shepheardes, thither came good old
Geron, young Histor, though unwilling, and upright Dicus, merry Pass and Nico.
As for Damaetas they durst not presume (his pride was such) to inuit him: and
Dorus they found might not be spared. And there under a bower was made of
bows (for Thyrsis house was not able to receive them) every one placed
according to his age. The women (for such was the manner of the country) kept
together to make good cheer among themselves, from which otherwise a certain
Kala: who poor soul wept for fear of that she desired. But among the
shepherds was al honest liberty, no fear of dangerous tel-tales, who hunt
greater prays, nor indeed minds in them to give tell-tales any occasion; but
one questioning with another of the manuring his ground, and governing his
flock, the highest Dycus insteede of thanks, sange this song with a clear
voice and cheerful countenance.

LEt mother earth now deck her self in flowers,
To see her offspring seek a good increase,
Where iustest love does vanquish Cupids powers
And ware of thoughts is swallowed up in peace
Which never may decrease
But like the turtells fair
Live one in two, a well united pair,
Which that no chance may stain,
O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
O heaven awake show forth thy stately face,
Let not these slumbring clouds thy beawties hide,

The honest Bridegroom, and the bashful Bride,
Whose loves may ever bide,
Like to the Elm and Vine,
With mutual embracements them to twyne:

O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
Ye Muses all which chaste affects allow,
And have to Thyrsis showed your secret skill,

And so to him and her your gifts distill,
That they all vice may kill:
And like to lillies pure
May please all eyes, and spotless may endure.

O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
Ye Nymphs which in the waters empire have,
Since Thyrsis music often does yield you praise,
Thyrsis crave.
Let one time (but long first) close up their days,
One grave their bodies seize:
And like two rivers sweet,
When they though diverse do together meet:

O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
Pan, father Pan, the god of silly sheep,
Whose care is cause that they in number grow,

Since from these good the others good does flow,
And make their issue show
In number like the heard
Of yonglings, which thy self with love have rearde.

O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
Virtue (if not a God) yet Gods chief part,
Be thou the knot of this their open vow,

He lean to her, she unto him do bow:
Each other still allow:
Like Oak and Mistletoe.
Her strength from him, his praise from her do grow.
In which most lovely train,
O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
But thou foul Cupid sire to lawless lust,
Be thou far hence with thy empoyson'd darte,
Which though of glittring gold, shall here take rust
Where simple love, which chastnesse does imparte,
Auoydes thy hurtful art,
Not needing charming skill,
Such minds with sweet affections for to fill,
Which being pure and plain,
O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
All churlish words, shrewd answers, crabbed looks,
All priuatenes, selfe-seeking, inward spite,
All waywardnes, which nothing kindly brooks,
All strife for toys, and clayming masters right:
Be hence aye put to flight,
All sturring husbands hate
Against neighbors good for womanish debate
Be fled as things most vain,
O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
All peacock pride, and fruits of peacocks pride
Longing to be with loss of substance gay
With retchlesnes what may thy house b^tide,
So that you may on hyer slippers stay
For ever hence away:
Yet let not sluttery,
The sink of filth, be counted huswifery:
But keeping wholesome mean,
O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
But above all away vile jealousy,
The evil of evils just cause to be unjust,
(How can he love suspecting treachery?
How can she love where love cannot win trust?)
Go snake hide thee in dust,
Ne dare once show thy face,
Where open hearts do hold so constant place,
That they thy sting restrain,
O Himen long their coupled joys maintain.
The earth is decked with flowers, the heavens displaid,
Muses grant guiftes, Nymphs long and joined life,
Pan store of babes, virtue their thoughts well staid,
Cupids lust gone, and gone is bitter strife,
Happy man, happy wife.
No pride shall them oppress,

And jealousy is slain:
For Himen will their coupled joys maintain.
Dicus, said Nico, although thou did not grant me the price the last day,
when undoubtedly I wan it, yet must I needs say, thou for thy part have soong
well and thriftelie. Pas straight desired all the company they would bear
witness, that Nico had once in his life spoken wisely; for said he, I will tell
it his father, who will be a glad man when he hears such news. Very true,
said Nico, Pas) gentle Nico, tell me what mischaunce it was that brought thee
to taste so fine a meat? Mary goodman blockhead said Nico, because he
speaks against jealousy, the filthy traitor to true affection, and yet
disguising Pas. Alas how ripe witted these young folks be now adays! But
well counseled shall that husband be, when this man commes to exhort him not
to be jealous. And so shall he, answered Nico, for I have seen a fresh
example, though it be not very fit to be known. Come, come, said Pas, be not
so squeamish, I know thou longest more to tell it, then we to hear it. But
for all his words Nico would not bestow


(But namelesse he, for blameless he shall be)
That married had a trick and bonny less
As in a summer day a man might see:
But he himself a foul unhandsome groom,

Now whether moved with self unworthiness,
Or with her beawtie fit to make a pray,
Fell jealousy did so his brain oppress,

He gest the worst (you wot what is the worst)
And in himself new doubting causes nursed.
While thus he feared the silly innocent,

Unto his house a iollie shepeheard went,
To whom our prince did bear a great good will,
Because in wrestling and in pastoral
He far did pass the rest of Shepherds all.
And therefore he a courtier was benamed,
And as a courtier was with cheer received,
(For they have toongs to make a poor man blamed.
If he to them his duty misconceaued)
And for this Courtier should well like his table,
The goodman bad his wife be serviceable.
And so she was, and all with good intent,
But few days past while she good manner vs'de,
But that her husband thought her service bent
To such an end as he might be abus'de.
Yet like a coward fearing strangers pride,
He made the simple wench his wrath abide.
With chumpish looks, hard words, and secret nips,
Grumbling at her when she his kindness sought,
Asking her how she tasted Courtiers lips,
He forced her think that which she never thought.
In fine he made her guess, there was some sweet
In that which he so feared that she should meet.
When once this entered was, in woman's heart,
And that it had enflamed a new desire,
There rested then, to play a woman's part,
Fuel to seek and not to quench the fire:
But (for his jealous eye she well did find)
She studied cunning how the same to blind.
And thus she did. One day to him she came,
And (though against his will) on him she leand,
And out began cry, ah well away for shame,
If you help not our wedlock will be staind,
The goodman starting, asked what did her move?
She sighed and said, the bad guest sought her love.
He little looking that she should complain
Of that, whereto he feared she was enclinde,
Bussing her often, and in his heart full feign,
He did demand what remedy to find;
How they might get that guest, from them to wend,
And yet the prince (that loved him) not offend.
Husband, quoth she, go to him by and by,
And tell him you do find I do him love,
And therefore pray him that of courtesy
He will absent himself, least he should move
A young girls heart, to that were shame for both,
Whereto you know, his honest heart were loath.
Thus shall you show that him you do not doubt,
And as for me (sweet husband) I must bear.
Glad was the man when he had heard her out,
And did the same, although with mickle fear.

In choler put, with whom he would not fight.
The Courtly shepherd much aghast at this,
Not seeing erst such token in the wife,

Knowing that evil becommes a household strife,
Did go his way, but soiourn'd near thereby,
That yet the ground hereof he might epsy.

Who would have sworn his spowse Diana was,
Watched when she a further point might gain,
Which little time did fitly bring to pass.
For to the Court her man was called by name,

Three days before that he must sure depart,
She written had (but in a hand disguisde)
A letter such which might from either part

She sealed it first, then she the sealing brake,
And to her jealous husband did it take.
With weeping eyes (her eyes she taught to weep)

Alas, quoth she, thus women's shame does creep.
The goodman read on both sides the content,
It title had, Unto my only love,
Subscription was, Yours most, if you will prove.
The pistle self, such kind of words it had,
My sweetest joy, the comfort of my sprite,
So may thy flocks increase thy dear heart glad,
So may each thing, even as thou wishest light,

This mourning inck, in which my heart does bleeds.
Long have I loved, (alas thou worthy art)
Long have I loved, (alas love craves love)
Long have I loved thy self, alas my heart
Does break, now tongue unto thy name does move,
And think not that thy answer answer is,
But that it is my doom of bale or bliss.
The jealous wretch must now to Court be gone:
Ne can he fail, for prince has for him sent:
Now is the time we may be here alone,
And give a long desire a sweet content.
Thus shall you both reward a lover true,
And cke revenge his wrong suspecting you.
And this was all, and this the husband read
With chafe enough, till she him pacified:
Desiring, that no grief in him he bread
Now that he had her words so truly tried:
But that he would, to him the letter show
That with his fault he might her goodness know.
That straight was done with many a boistrous threat,
That to the King, he would his sin declare,
But now the Courtier began to smell the feate,
And with some words which showed little care,
He stayed until the goodman was departed,
Then gave he him the blow which never smarted.
Thus may you see, the jealous wretch was made
The Pandare of the thing, he most did fear,
Take heed therefore, how you ensue that trade,
Least the same marks of jealousy you bear.
For sure, no jealousy can that prevent,
Whereto two parties once be full content.
Behold, said Pas, a whole dicker of wit: he has picked out such a tale with
intention to keep a husband from iealosie, which were enough to make a
sanctified husband jealous, to see subtleties so much in the feminine gender.
But, said he, I will strike Nico dead, with the wise words shall flow out of
my gorge. And without further entreatie thus sang.

WHo does desire that chaste his wife should be,
First be he true, for truth does truth deserve:
Then such be he, as she his worth may see,
And one man still credit with her preserve.
Not toying kind, nor causlesly unkind,
Not sturring thoughts, nor yet denying right
Not spying faults, nor in plain errors blind,
Never hard hand, nor ever raines too light.

(The one does force, the later does entise)
Allow good company, but keep from thence
Al filthy mouth's that glory in their vice.
This done, thou have no more, but leave the rest

Well concluded said Nico, When he has done al, he leaves the matter to his
wives discretion. Now whenever thou mariest, let her discretion deck thy
head with Actaeons ornament, Pas was so angry with his wish, being in deed
toward marriage, Dicus desired Philisides (who as a stranger sat among them,
reuoluing in his mind all the tempests of evil fortunes he had passed) that he
would do so much grace to the company, as to sing one of his country songs.
Philisides knowing it no good manners to besquemish of his coming, having put
himself in their company, without further study began

THe ladd Philisides

In flowery field a gladder eye to please:
His pipe was at his foot
His lambs were him besides,
A widow turtle near on bared roots

Each thing both sweet and sadd
Did draw his boiling brain
To think, and think with pain
Of Miras beams eclipst by absence bad.

With tears, he said, or sorrow said for him.
O earth, once answer give,
So may thy stately grace
By north, or south still rich adorned live:
Mira Long may be
On thy then blessed face,
Whose ^oote does set a heaven on cursed thee,
I ask, now answer me.
If the author of thy bliss
Phoebus, that shepherd high
Do turn from thee his eye,
Does not thy self, when he long absent is,
Like Rogue, all ragged go,
And pine away with daily wasting woe?
Tell me you wanton brook,
So may your sliding race
Shunn lothed-louing banks with conning crook:
So in you ever new
Mira may look her face,
And make you fair with shadow of her hue:
So when to pay your due
To mother sea you come,
She chide you not for stay,
Nor beat you for your play,
Tell me if your diuerted springs become
Absented quite from you,
Are you not dried? Can you your selves renew?
Tell me you flowers fair
Cowslipp and Columbine,
So may your Make this wholesome springtime air
With you embraced lie,
And lately thence untwine:
But with dew dropps engendre children hy:
So may you never die,
But pulld by Miras hand
Dress bosom hers or hedd,
Or scatter on her bed,
Tell me, if husband springtime leave your land,
When he from you is sent,
Whither not you, languisht with discontent?
Tell me my seely pipe,
So may thee still betide
A clenly cloth thy moistnes for to wipe.
So may the cheries redd
Of Miras lips divide
Their sugared selves to kiss thy happy hedd:
So may her ears be ledd,
Her ears where Music lives,
To hear, and not despise
The liribliring cries,
Tell, if that breath, which thee thy sounding gives,
Be absent far from thee,
Absent alone can thou then piping be?
Tell me my Lamb of gold,
So may thou long abide
The day well fed; the night in faithful fold:
So grow thy wool of note,
In time that richly di'de
It may be part of Miras peticoate,
Tell me, if wolves the throat
Have cought of thy dear damme,
Or she from thee be staide,
Or thou from her be straide,

Or rather till thou die
Still for thy Dam with bea-waymenting cry?
Tell me o Turtle true,
So may no fortune breed

So may thy blessings swarm
That Mira may thee feed
With hand and mouth, with lapp and breast keep warm,
Tell me if greedy arm,

With traitor lime the one,
The other left alone,
Tell me poor wretch, parted from wretched pray
Disdain not you the green,

Earth, brook, flowr's, pipe, lamb, Dove
Say all, and I with them,
Absence is death, or worse, to them that love.
So I unlucky lad
Whom hills from her do hemme,

O fortune too too badd,
I rather would my sheep
Thad'st killed with a stroke,
Caban lost my cloak,
When want one hour those eyes which my joys keep.
Oh! what does wailing win?
Speech without end were better not begin.
My song clime thou the wind

That on his wings the leauell thou may find
To hit, but Kissing hit
Her ear's the weights of wit.
If thou know not for whom thy Master dies,

She is the heardesse fair that shines in dark
And gives her kidds no food, but willow's bark.
This said, at length he ended,
His often sigh-broken dittie,

With skin in sorrow died,
With face the plot of pity,
With thoughts which thoughts their own tormentors tried,
He raze, and straight espied
His Ram, who to recover
The Ewe another loved,
With him proud battle proved.
He envied such a death in sight of lover,
And always westward eying
More envied Phoebus for his western flyinge.
The whole company would gladly have taken this occasion of requesting
Philisides

AS I my little flock on Ister bank
(A little flock; but well my pipe the couthe)
Did piping lead, the Sun already sanke
Beyond our world, and ere I got my boothe
Each thing with mantle black the night does scothe;
Saving the glowe worm, which would courteous be
Of that small light often watching shepherds see.
The welkin had full niggardly enclosed
In cofer of dim clouds his silver groates,
Icleped stars; each thing to rest disposed:
The caves were full, the mountains void of goats:
The birds eyes closd closed their chirping notes.
As for the Nightingale woodmusiques King,
It August was, he daynde not then to sing.
Amid my sheep, though I saw naught to fear
Yet (for I nothing saw) I feared sore;
Then found I which thing is a charge to bear
As for my sheep I dradded mickle more
Then ever for my self since I was bore.
I sat me down: for see to go ne could,
And sange unto my sheep lest stray they should.
The song I sange old Lanquet bad me taught,
Lanquet, the shepherd best swift Ister knew,
For clerkly reed, and hating what is naught,
For faithful heart, clean hands, and mouth as true:
With his sweet skill my skillesse youth he drew,
To have a feeling iast of him that sitts
Beyond the heaven, far more beyond your wits.
He said, the Music best thilke powers pleased
Was iumpe concord between our wit and will:
Where highest notes to godliness are raisd,
And lowest sink not down to jot of ill:

How sheepheards did of yore, how now they thrive,
Spoiling their flock, or while twixt them they strive.
He liked me, but pitied lustful youth:

He still hoped well, because he loved truth;
Till forste to part, with heart and eyes even sore,
To worthy Coriden he gave me ore,
But thus in oaks true shade recounted he

Such manner time there was (what time I n'ot)
When all this Earth, this damme or mould of ours
Was only won'd with such as beasts begot:

The cattle wild, or tame, in natures bowers
Might freely rome, or rest, as seemed them:
Man was not man their dwellings into hem.

For nothing can endure where order n'is.
For once the Lion by the Lamb did lie;
The fearful Hind the Leopard did kiss:
Hurtles was Tigers pawe and Serpents hiss.

Like Senators a harmeles empire had.
At which whether the others did repine,
(For envy harbreth most in feeblest hearts)

(As even in beasts their dammes leave changing parts)
The multitude to Jove a suite empartes,
With neighing, blaying, braying, and barking,
Roaring, and howling for to have a King.
A King, in language theirs they said they would:
(For then their language was a perfect speech)
The birds likewise with chirpes, and puing could
Cackling, and chattering, that of Jove beseech.
Only the owl still warnde them not to seech

But saw they would, and he to deserts went.
Jove wisely said (for wisdom wisely says)
O beasts, take heed what you of me desire.
Rulers will think all things made them to please,
And soon forget the swincke due to their hire,
But since you will, part of my heavenly fire
I will you lend; the rest your selves must give,
That it both seen and felt may with you live.
Full glad they were and took the naked sprite,
Which straight the Earthy clothed in his claye:
The Lion, heart; the Ounce gave active might;
The Horse, good shape; the Sparrow, lust to play;
Nightingale, voice, entising songs to say.
Elephant gave a perfect memory:
And Parot, ready tongue, that to apply.
The Fox gave craft; the Dog gave flattery;
Ass, patience; the Mole, a working thought;
Eagle, high look; Wolf secret cruelty:
Monkie, sweet breath; the Cow, her fair eyes brought;
The Ermion, whitest skin, spotted with naught;
The sheep, mild-seeming face; climing, the Bear;
The Stagge did give the harm eschewing fear.
The Hare, her sleights; the Cat, his melancholy;
Ante, industry; and Connie, skill to build;
Cranes, order; Storkes, to be appearing holy;
Camaeleon, ease to change; Ducke, ease to yield;
Crocodile, tears, which might be falsely spilde:
Ape great thing gave, though he did mowing stand,
The instrument of instruments, the hand.
Each other beast likewise his present brings:
And (but they drad their Prince they ought should want)
They all consented were to give him wings:
And aye more awe toward him for to plant,
To their own work this privilege they grant,
That from thenceforth to all eternity,
No beast should freely speak, but only he.
Thus Man was made; thus Man their Lord became:
Who at the first, wanting, or hiding pride,
He did to beasts best use his cunning frame;
With water drink, herbs meat, and naked hide,
And fellow-like let his dominion slide;
Not in his sayings saying I, but we:
As if he meant his lordship common be.
But when his seat so rooted he had found,
That they now skilld not, how from him to wend;
Then began in guiltless earth full many a wound,
Iron to seek, which against it self should bend,

But yet the common Damme none did bemone;
Because (though hurt) they never heard her groan.
Then began the factions in the beasts to breed;

(As Tigers, Leopards, Bears, and Lions seed)
Disdaind with this, in deserts sought their restes;
Where famine rauine taught their hungry chestes,
That craftily he forced them to do ill,

For murders done, which never erst was seen,
By those great beasts, as for the weakers good,
He chose themselves his guarders for to been,

As horse and dog, not great, but gentle blood:
Blithe were the commons cattle of the field,
Tho when they saw their foen of greatness kilde.

Then quickly did the meaner cattle find,
The great beams gone, the house on shoulders light:
For by and by the horse fair bitts did bind:
The dog was in a collar taught his kind.

When faloon they, and gossehauke saw in mewe.
Worst fell to smallest birds, and meanest heard,
Whom now his own, full like his own he used.

And when they were well vs'de to be abused,
For hungry teeth their flesh with teeth he bruised:
At length for glutton taste he did them kill:
At last for sport their silly lives did spill.
But yet o man, rage not beyond thy need:
Deem it no glory to swell in tyranny.
Thou art of blood; joy not to see things bleed:
Thou fear death; think they are loath to die.
A plaint of guiltless hurt does pierce the sky.

Or know your strengths, and then you shall do well.
Thus did I sing, and pipe eight sullen hours
To sheep, whom love, not knowledge, made to hear,
Now fancies fits, now fortunes balefull stowers:
But then I homewards called my lambkins dear:
For to my dimmed eyes began to appear
The night grown old, her black head waxen gray,
Sure shepherds sign, that morn should soon fetch day.
ACcording to the nature of diverse cares, diverse judgments straight
followed: some praising his voice, others his words fit to frame a pastoral
style, others Geron (who had borne him a grudge ever since in one of their
Eclogues he had taken him up ouer-bitterly) took hold of this occasion to make
his revenge, and said, He never saw thing worse proportioned, then to bring in
a tale of he knew not what beasts at such a sport-meeting, when rather some
song of love, or matter for Geron invited Histor to answer him in
Eclogue-wise; who indeed having been long in love with the fair Kala, and now
by Lalus ouergone; was grown into a detestation of marriage. But thus it was.

Geron. Histor. Geron. In faith, good Histor, long is your delay,
From holy marriage sweet and surest mean:
Our foolish lust in honest rules to stay.
I pray thee do to Lalus sample lean:
Thou see, how friske, and jolly now he is,
That last day seemed, he could not chew a bean.
Believe me man, there is no greater bliss,
Then is the quiet joy of loving wife;
Which who so wants, half of himself does miss.
Friend without change, playfellow without strife,
Food without fulness, counsel without pride,
Is this sweet doubling of our single life.

Histor. No doubt to whom so good chance did betide,
As for to find a pasture strawed with gold,
He were a fool, if there he did not bide.
Who would not have a Phoenix if he could?
The humming Waspe, if it had not a sting,
Before all flies the Waspe accept I would.
But this bad world, few golden fields does bring,
Phoenix but one, of Crows we millions have:
The Waspe seems gay, but is a combrous thing.
If many Kalaes our Arcadias gave,
Lalus example I would soon ensue,
And think, I did my self from sorrow save.

Shrewdnes so stirs, pride so puffes up the heart,
They seldom ponder what to them is due.
With meager looks, as if they still did smart;
Puiling, and whimpring, or else scolding flat,

Either dull silence, or eternal chat;
Still contrary to what her husband says;
If he do praise the dog, she likes the cat.
Austere she is, when he would honest plays;

She bids him go, and yet from journey stays.
She war does ever with his kinsfolk keep,
And makes them fremb'd, who friends by nature are,
Envying shallow toys with malice deep.

The little coin his sweating brows have got,
Must go for that, if for her lowres he care:
Or else; Nay faith, mine is the lucklest lot,
That ever fell to honest woman yet:

Such is their speech, who be of sober wit;
But who do let their tongues show well their rage,
Lord, what bywords they speak, what spite they spit?
The house is made a very loathsome cage,

With such a will as nothing can assuage.
Dearly the servants do their wages buy,
Reuil'd for each small fault, sometimes for none:
They better live that in a gaile do lie.

For I seek not their shame, but still me thinks,
A better life it is to lie alone.

Geron. Who for each fickle fear from virtue shrinkes,

No mortal man the cup of surety drinks.
The heavens do not good haps in handfuls bring,
But let us pike our good from out much bad:
That still our little world may know his king.

While that we do what nature does require,
And for the event we never ought be sad.
Man often is plag'de with air, is burnt with fire,
In water drownd^ in earth his burial is;
And shall we not therefore their use desire?
Nature above all things requires this,
That we our kind do labor to maintain;
Which drawne-out line does hold all humane bliss.
Thy father justly may of thee complain,
If thou do not repay his deeds for thee,
In granting unto him a grandsires gain.
Thy commonwealth may rightly grieved be,
Which must by this immortal be preserved,
If thus thou murder thy posterity.
His very being he has not deserved,
Who for a selfe-conceipt will that forbear,
Whereby that being aye must be conserved.
And God forbid, women such cattle were,
As you paint them: but well in you I find,
No man does speak aright, who speaks in fear.
Who only sees the ill is worse then blind.
These fifty winters married have I been;
And yet find no such faults in womankind.
I have a wife worthy to be a Queen,
So well she can command, and yet obey;
In ruling of a house so well she is seen.
And yet in all this time betwixt us tway,
We bear our double yoke with such consent,
That never past foul word, I dare well say.
But these be your loue-toyes, which still are spent
In lawless games, and love not as you should,
But with much study learn late to repent.
How well last day before our Prince you could
Blind Cupids works with wonder testify?
Yet now the root of him abase you would.
Go to, go to, and Cupid now apply
To that where thou thy Cupid may auowe,
And thou shall find, in women virtue lie.
Sweet supple minds which soon to wisdom bow
Where they by wisdoms rule directed are,
And are not forced fond thraldom to allow.
As we to get are framed, so they to spare:
We made for pain, our pains they made to cherish:
We care abroad, and they of home have care.
O Histor, seek within thy self to flourish:
Thy house by thee must live, or else be gone:
And then who shall the name of Histor nourish?
Riches of children pass a Princes throne;
Which touch the fathers heart with secret joy,
When without shame he says, these be mine own.
Marry therefore; for marriage will destroy
Those passions which to youthful head do clime,
Mothers and Nurses of all vain annoy.

He spoke these words with such affection, as a curious eye might easily have
perceived he liked Thyrsis fortune better then he loved his person. But then in
deed did all arise, and went to the women, where spending all the day, and
good part of the night in dancing, carolling, and wassaling. Lastly, they left
Thyrsis, where he long desired to be left, and with many unfeigned thanks
returned every man to his home. But some of them having to cross the way of
the two Lodges, might see a Lady making doleful lamentations over a body
which seemed dead unto them. But me thinks Damaetas cries unto me, if I come
not the sooner to comfort him, he will leave off his golden work that has
already

The end of the third Book.
THE FOVRTH BOOK OF THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKES
THE almighty wisdom evermore delighting to show the world, that by
unlikeliest means greatest matters may come Damaetas to play a part in this
royal pageant, so having continued him still an actor, now that all things
were grown ripe for an end, made his folly the instrument Damaetas having
spent the whole day in breaking up the cumbersome work of the pastor Dorus,
and feeling in all his labor no pain so much, as that his hungry hopes
received any stay, having with the price of much sweat and weariness gotten
up the huge stone, which he thought should have Who has his hire, has well
his labor plast:
Earth thou did seek, and store of earth thou has^.


What an inward discountenance it was to master Damaetas, to find his hope of
Damaetas had, or at least the bethinking what was Midas fancy, when after the
great pride he conceived to be made Judge between Gods, he was rewarded with
the ornament of an Asses ears. Yet the deep apprehension he had received of
such riches, could Damaetas, punished within night, in steed of the lightsome
countenance of Pamela, which gave such an inward decking to that lodge, as
prowdest palaces might have cause to envy it; and of the grateful
conversation of Dorus, whose witty behavior made that lonelines to seem full
of good company: in steed of the loud scolding of Miso, and the busy rumbling
up and down of Mopsa, which though they were so short, as quite contrary to
the others praise-worthines, yet were they far before them in filling of a
house: he found nothing but a solitary darkness; which as naturally it
breeds a kind of irksome gastfulnes, so it was to him a most present terror,
remembering the charge he had left behind, which he well knew imported Mopsa,
fitly seated there for wit and dignity: There (I will not say with joy, for
how could he taste of joy, whose Mopsa my beloved chicken, here am I thine own
father Damaetas, never in such a towardnes of hanging, if thou can not help
me. But never a word could his eloquence procure of Mopsa, who indeed was
there attending for greater matters. This Damaetas, who thought all the world
was conspired against him: and therefore with a seely choler he began another
tune. Thou vile Mopsa, said he, now the vengeance of my fatherly curse light
overthwart thee, if thou do not straight answer me. But neither blessing nor
cursing could prevail Mopsa, who was now great with child, with the
expectation of her may game Damaetas rubbing his elbowe, stamping and whining,
seeing neither of these take place, began to throw stones at her, and withal
to conjure her by the name of hellish Mopsa. But when he had named her the
third time, no chime can more suddenly follow the striking of a Clock, then
she, verily thinking it was Damaetas, as soon as she was down, came running
to her: and Pluto. But then Damaetas began a fresh to desire his daughter not
to forget the pains he had taken for her in her childhoode (which he was sure
she could not remember) and to tell him where Pamela was. O good Apollo, said
Mopsa, if ever thou did bear love to Phaethons mother, let me have a King
to my husband Alas, what speak thou of Phaethon? Said Damaetas: If by thy
circumspect means I find not out Pamela, thy father will be hanged to morrow.
It is no matter though Mopsa: do but thou make Dorus a King, and let him be
my husband, good Apollo: for my courage does much prick me toward him. Ah
Mopsa, cried out Damaetas, where is thy wit? Do thou not know thy father?
How have thou forgotten thy self? I do not ask wit of thee mine own God,
said she: but I see thou would have me remember my father, and indeed
forget Damaetas, and do but answer me my question. O I thank thee said
Mopsa, withal my heart heartily: but let them be all Kings. Damaetas seeing no
other way prevail fell down on his knees, Mopsa Mopsa, said he, do not thus
cruelly torment me: I am already wretched enough, alas either help me or tell
me thou can not. She Apollo in courtesy, kneeled down on the other side, I will
never leave tormenting thee said Mopsa, until thou have satisfied my longing,
but I will proclaim thee a promise breaker, that even Jupiter shall hear it.
Now by the fostring thou have received in this place save my life said
Damaetas, now by the fair Ash answered Mopsa, where thou did receive so
great a good turn, grant Pamela said Damaetas? O a lusty husband, said
Mopsa; Damaetas that now verily assured himself, his daughter was madd,
began utterly to despair of his life, and therefore amazedly catching her in
his arms, to see whether he could bring her to her self, he might feel
the weight of of a great cudgel light upon his shoulders, and for the first
greeting he Misos voice, by the calling him ribaulde villain, and asking him
whether she could not serve his turn as well as Charita? For Miso having
according to Dorus counsel, gone to Mantinea, and there harbored her self
in an old acquaintance house of hers, as soon as ten of the clock was
stricken (where she had remained closely all that while, I think with such an
amiable cheer, as when Juno sat crosse-legged, to hinder the childbirth of
her husbands love) with open mouth she went to the Magistrate appointed over
such matters, and there with the most scolding inuectiue, her rage rather then
eloquence could bring forth, she required his aid to take Damaetas, who had
left his duty to the King and his daughter, to commit adultery in the house
of Charitas uncle, in the Ondemian street. Charita remembered, nor any such
street known. Yet such was the general mislike all men had of Damaetas
unworthy advancement, that every man was glad to make himself a minister of
that, which might redounde to his shame, and therefore with Panike cries and
laughters, there was no suspected place in all the city but was searched for
under the title of Damaetas; Miso ever foremost encowraging came, imputing the
not finding her husband, to any chance, rather then to his innocence. For her
heart being apt to receive and nourish a bitter thought it had so swallowed up
a determinate condemnation, that in the very anotomie of her spirits one
should have found nothing but devilish disdain, and hateful jealousy. In
this Damaetas was making that ill understood intercession, to his foolish
Mopsa. As soon as she hard her husbands voice, she verily thought she had her
play: and therefore stealing from her mare as softely as she could, she came
creeping and halting behind him, even as he thinking his daughters little
wits had quite left her great nowle; Miso who saw nothing but through the
coulloure of reuenge-full anger, established upon the fore-iudgement of his
trespass, undoubtedly resolving that Mopsa was Charita, Dorus had told her
of, mumping out her hoarse chafe, she gave him the wooden salutation you heard
of. Damaetas that was Pamela is lost, Pamela is lost. Miso still holding on the
course of her former fancy, what tellest thou me naughty varlet of Pamela,
do thou think that does answer me, for abusing the laws of Damaetas
began now to think, that either a general madding was fallen, or else that
all this was but a vision. But as for visions the smarte of the cudgel put out
of his fancy: and therefore again turning to his wife, not Miso said he,
hereafter thou may examine me, do but now tell me what is become of Pamela.
I will first examine this drabbe said she, and withal let fall her stafe as
hard as she could upon Mopsa, still taking her for Charita. But Mopsa that was
already angry, thinking that she had hindered her from Apollo, lepte up and
caught her by the throat, like to have strangled her, but that Damaetas from a
condemned man was feign to become a judge and part this fair, such a picture
of a rude discord, where each was out with the other two. And then getting the
opportunity of their falling out, to hold himself in surety, who was
indeed, the veriest coward of the three, he renewed his earnest demand of
them. But it was a sport to see, how the former conceits Dorus had printed in
their imaginations, Miso though now she found and felt it was her daughter
Mopsa, yet did Charita continually pass through her thoughts which she uttered
with such crabbed questions to Damaetas, that he not possibly conceauing any
part of her doubt, remained astonished, and the astonishment increased her
doubt. And as for Mopsa, as first she did assuredly take him to be Apollo
Damaetas did what Miso meant by Charita: till at length with much urging them,
being indeed better able to persuade both, then to meet hand to hand with
either, he prevailed so much with them, as to bring them into the lodge to see
what loss their necligence had suffered. Then indeed the nere neighborhood
they bare to themselves, made them leave other toys, and look into what
dangerous plight they were all fallen, as soon as the King should know his
daughters escape. And as for Damaetas who did fear that among his other
evils, the thunderbolt of that storm would fall upon his shoulders, slipte
away from them, but with so maigre a cheer as might much sooner engender
laughter then pity. O true Arcadia would he say (tearinge his hair and
bearde, and sometime for too much woe, making Pamela Pamela, how often when I
brought thee in fine posies of all coulored flowers would thou clappe me on
the cheek, and say thou would be on day even with me? Was this thy meaning to
bring me to an eue^ pair Dorus that came hither to learn good manners of me?
Did I ever teach thee to make thy master sweat out his heart for nothing, and
in the mean time to run away thy mistres? O my dun cow, I did think so^e evil
was toward me, ever since the last day thou did run away from me, and held
up thy tail so pitifully: did not I se an eagle kill a Cuckoe, which was plain
fore token unto me Pamela Miso (if I durst say it to thy face) why did thou
suspect thy husband, that loves a piece of chese better then a woman? And thou
little Mopsa that shall inherit the shame of thy fathers death, was it time for
thee to clime trees, which should so shortly be my best burial? o that I could
live without death, or die before I were aware. O heart why have thou no hands
at commandment to Pamela that night had retired her self. So thither with
trembling hammes he carried himself, but employinge his double keye which the
King Pyrocles so had he left it unregarded. But Damaetas that ever know the
buttery better then any other place, got in that way and pasing softly to
Philocleas chamber, where he thought most likely Pamela, the door being left
open he entered in, and by the light of the lamp, he might discern on in bed
with her: which he although he took to be Pamela, yet thinking no surety
enough in a matter touching his neck, he went heard to the bedside of these
unfortunate lovers, who at that time being not much before the break of day
(whether it were they were so divinely surprised, to bring with a mutual
sleep) yet not forgetting with viny embracements, to give any eye a perfect
model of affection. But Damaetas looking with the lamp in his hand but
neither with such a face nor mind) upon these excellent creatures, as Psyche
did upon her unknown lover, and giving every way freedom to his fearful
eyes, did Zelmane and therefore much different from the Lady he sought: but
that this same Zelmane did more differ from the Zelmane he and others had ever
taken her for, wherein the change of her apparel chiefly confirmed his
opinion satisfied with that, and not thinking it good to awake the sleeping
Lion, he went down again, taking with him Pyrocles sword, (wherewith upon
his slight Pyrocles came only apparelled thither) being sure to leave no
weapon in the chamber, and so making the door as fast as he could on the
outside, hopinge with the revealing of this, (as he thought greater fault) to
make his own the less, or at least that this injury would so fill the Kings
head, that he should not have leisure to chastise his necligence (like a fool
not considering that the more rage breeds Zelmane did abuse his daughter. The
noise he made being a man of no few words joined to the yelping sound of Miso,
and his unpleasant enheritrix brought together some number of the shepherds,
to whom he without any regard of reserving it for Zelmane whom they had taken
all that while to be a woman, was as arrant a man as himself was, whereof he
had seen sufficient signs and tokens; and that he was as close as a
butterfly with the Lady Philoclea, the poor men jealous of their Princes
honor, were ready with weapons to have entered the lodge; Basilius having past
over the night more happy in contemplation then action, having had his spirits
sublymed with the sweet imagination of embrasing the most desired Zelmane,
doubting least me Caves darkness might deceive him in the days approach, thought
it now season to return to his Zelmane, to observe due orders toward
Gynecia. Therefore departing but not departing without bequeathing by a will of
words, sealed with many kisses, a full guifte of all his love and life to his
misconceaued bedfellowe, he went to the mouth of the Cave, there to apparel
himself, in which doing the motion of his joy could not be bridled from
uttering O Night the ease of care the pledge of pleasure,
Desires best mean, harnest of hearts affected,
The seat of peace, the throne which is erected
Of humane life to be the quiet measure,
Be victor still of Phoebus golden treasure:
Who has our sight with too much sight infected,
Whose light is cause we have our lives neglected
Turning all natures course to self displeasure.
These stately stars in their now shining faces,
With sinlesse sleep, and silence wisdoms mother,
Witness his wrong which by thy help is eased:
Thou art therefore of these our desert places
The sure refuge, by thee and by no other
My soul is bliste, sense ioyde, and fortune raised.


And yet farther would his joys needs break forth. O Basilius, said he,
the rest of thy time, has been but a dream unto thee: it is now only thou
beginnest to live, now only thou have entered into the way of blisfulnes.
Should fancy of marriage Gynecia, but yield to the pre-eminence of more
excellent guiftes, supporte thy self with such marble pillars as she does,
deck thy breast with those alablaster boules that Zelmane does: then
accompanied with such a tittle, perhapes thou may recover the possession of
my otherwise inclined love. But alas Gynecia thou can not show such evidence;
therefore thy plea is vain. Gynecia heard all this he said who had cast
about her Zelmanes garment, wherein she came thither, and had followed Basilius
to the Caves entry; full of inward vexation, betwixt the deadly accusation of
her own Zelmane had abused her. But because of the one side (finding the King
did think her to be Zelmane she had liberty to imagine it might rather be the
Kings own unbridled enterprise, which had barred Zelmane, then Zelmanes
cunning deceiving of her, and that of the other if she should heddilie seek
a violent revenge her own honor might be as much interessed, as Zelmane
endaungered: she fell to this determination. First with fine handling of the
King to settle in him a perfect good opinion of her, and then as she should
learn, how things had passed, to take into her self new devised counsel,
but this being her first action, having given unlooked for attendaunce to the
King, she heard with what partiality he did prefer her to her self, she saw in
him how much fancy does not Basilius, setting her self in a grave behavior
and stately silence before him: until he, (who at the first thinking her by so
much shadow as he could see to be Zelmane, was beginning his loving
ceremonies) did now being helped by the peeping light, wherewith bitterness
spoke unto him: Alas my Lord, well did your words discipher your mind, and
well be those words confyrmed with this gesture. Very loathsome must that
woman be, from whom a man has cause to go back; and little better liked is
that wife, before whom the husband preferrs them he Pamela, become an odious
name unto you? If my life hitherto led have not avoided suspicion? If my
violated truth to you be deserving of any punishment, I refuse Zelmanes young
years had Gynaecia might then have been with much more right so basely
despised.

Basilius that was more ashamed to see himself so overtaken, then Vulcan
Gynaecia, the violence of whose sore in deed ran another way, was content
thus to fasten up the last stitch of her anger. Well, well my Lord, said she,
it shall well become you so to govern your self, as you may be fit rather to
direct me, then to be judged of me; and rather to be a wise master of me, then

Basilius that would rather then his life the matter had been ended, the best
rethorike he had, was flat demanding pardon of her, swearing it was the very
force of Apollos destenye which had carried him thus from his own bias; but
that now neither am I to give pardon to you my Lord, said she, nor you to
bear honor to me. I have taken this boldness for the unfeigned love I owe unto
you, to deliver my sorrow unto you; much more for the care I have of your well
doing, then for any other self fancy. For well I know that by your good
estate my life is mayntayned, neither, if I would, can I separate my self from
your fortune. For Basilius own shame had found him culpable, and had already
even in soul read his own condemnacion, so much did this unexpected mildnes
of Gynaecia captive his heart unto her, which otherwise perchance would have
grown to Basilius great contentacion, who began something to mark himself in
his own doings, his hard hap guided his eye to the cup of gold, wherein
Gynaecia had put the lickourment for Zelmane, and having failed of that guest,
was now carrying it home again. But he whom perchance sorrow, perchance
some long disaccustomed Gynaecia I dye. Have care: of what or how much further
Gynaecia having well perceived the changing of his color, and those other
evil signs, yet had not looked for such a sudden overthrow, but rather had
bethought her self what was best for him, when she suddenly saw the matter
come to that periode, coming to him, and neither with any cries getting a
word of him, nor with any other possible of the inward wickedness, still
nourishing this debatefull fire; her complaynte now not having an end to be
directed unto something to disburden sorrow, but a necessary downfall of
inward wretchedness. She saw the rigor of the laws was like to lay a
shameful death upon her, which being for that action undeserved,

O bottomless pit of sorrow, in which I cannot conteyne my self, having the
fyrebrands of all furyes within me, still falling, and yet by the infinitenes
of it Philoclea, Philoclea, well has my mother revenged upon me my vnmotherly
hating of thee. O Zelmane, to whom yet (least any miserye should fail me)
remain some sparks of my detestable love, if thou have (as now alas! now my
mind assures me thou have) deceived Zelmane, passing a troublesome passage,
she found a dead body which told her there should be her only rest. This no
sooner caught hold of her remembrance, then that she determining with her
self, it was a direct vision of her fore-appoynted end, took a certain
resolucion to embrace Basilius; And even so will I rest said she, and join
this faultye soul of mine to thee, if so much the angry gods will grant me.

As she was in this plight, the Sun now climing over our Horizon, the first
Damaetas made of the Lady Philoclea, ran with the doleful tidings of
Basilius death unto him, who presently with all his company came to the Caves
entrye where the Kings body lay. Damaetas for his part more glad for the hope
he had of his private escape, then sorye for the public loss his Country
received for a Prince Gynaecia nature prevailed above judgment; and the shame
she conceived to be taken in that order, overcame for that instant the former
resolucion, so that as soon as she saw the foremost of the pastoral troop,
the wretched Princess ran to have hid her face in the next woods, but with
such a mind, that she knew not almost her self what she could wish to be the
ground of her safety. Damaetas that saw her run away in Zelmanes upper
raiment, and judging her to be so, thought certaynely all the spirits in hell
were come to play a Tragedy in these woods, such strange change he saw every
Pamela fled away with Dorus; his wife and Mopsa in diverse franzies. But of
all other things Zelmane conquered his capacity, suddenly from a woman grown
to a man; and from a locked chamber gotten before him into the fields, which
he gave the rest quickly to understand; for in steed of doing any thing as
the Gynecia, and esteeming her running away, a great condemnation of her own
guiltiness; others going to their Prince, to Basilius a Prince to defend you,
a Father to care for you, a companyon in your joys, a friend in your wants.
And if you loved him, show you hate the author of his loss. It is I, faithful
Arcadians, that have spoiled she finding she was not a sufficient orator to
persuade her own death by their hands, well, said she, it is but so much more
time of misery, for my part I will not give my life so much pleasure from
hence forward as to yield to his desire of his own choice of death; since all
the rest is taken away, yet let me excel in misery. Lead me therefore
Damaetas, in which within a short time it wrought the like effect; although
Damaetas did so much to recover him, that for very love of his life he dashed
out his brains. But now all together and having Gynaecia among them, who to
make her self the more odious, did continually record to their minds the
excess of their loss, they yielded themselves over to all those forms of
lamentacion that Mausolus Tomb. But as with such hearty lamentacion, they
dispersed among those woods their resounding shrikes, the Philanax: who at that
time was coming to visit the King, accompanied with diverse of the worthy
Arcadian Lords, who with him had visited the places adjoining for the more
assurance Basilius solitarines, a thing after the late mutiny he had usually
done, and since the Princesses return more diligently continued, which having
now likewise performed, thinking it as well his duty to see the King as of
good purpose, being so near, to receive his further direction: accompanied as
above said he was this morning coming unto him, when these unpleasant voices
gave his mind an uncertain presage of his near approaching sorrow. For by and
by he saw the body of his dearly esteemed Prince, and heard Gynecias
lamenting: not such as the turtle-like love is wont to make for the ever
ouer-soone loss of her only loved make, but Damaetas, knowing him to be the
second person in Authority, gave forthwith relacion unto him, what they knew
and had proved of this dolorous spectacle, besides the other accidents of his
children. But he principally touched Philanax should not now have cause in
your loss, to bewail his own overthrow. And therewith taking himself; and
in deed evil fitteth it me, said he, to let go my heart to womanish
complaints, since my Prince being undoubtedly well, it rather shows love of my
self, which makes me bewail mine own loss. No, the true love Philanax, as
she had before to the Shepherds; willing him not to look upon her as a woman,
but a monster; not as a princess, but a traitor to his prince; not as Basilius
wife, but as Basilius murderer. She told him how the world like those
vermin that suck of the living blood, and leave the body as soon as it is
dead, poor Princess needelesly seeking to kindle him, who did most deadly
detest her, which he uttered in this bitter answer. Madame said he, you do
well to hate your self, for you cannot hate a worse creature; and though we
feel enough your Mantinea, a great Arcadians: the manner of that country
being, that where the Prince died, there should be orders taken for the
countries government, and in the place any murder was committed, the judgment
should be given there, before the body was buried, both concurring is this
matter, and already great part of the Nobility being arrived, he delivered the
Princes to a gentelman Damaetas taking from him the keys of both the lodges,
calling him the moth of his Princes estate, and only spot of his judgment, he
caused him with his wife and daughter, to be fettered up in as many chains
and clogges, as they could bear, and every third hour to be cruelly whipped,
till the determinate judgment should be given of all these matters. That done
having sent Pamela, although with small hope of ouertaking them, he himself went
well accompanied to the lodge where the two unfortunate lovers were attending a
cruel conclusion, of their long painful, and late most painful affection,
Damaetas clownish eyes, having ben the only discouerers of Pyrocles stratagem,
had no sooner taken a full vewe of them Damaetas made, or with the creeping in
of the light, or rather that as extreme grief had procured his sleep, so
extreme care had measured his salve to come to themselves) Pyrocles awaked;
And being up the first evil hansell he had of the ill case wherein he was, was
the seeing himself deprived of his sword, from which he had never separated
himself in any occasion, and even that night first by the Kings bed, and
then there had laid it, as he thought safe: putting great part of the trust of
his well doing in his own Homere does ever make Achilles the best armed. But
that, as I say, was the first ill token: but by and by he perceived he was a
prisoner before any arest, for the door which he had left open was made
Damaetas doing, then went he to the windows, to see if that way, there were
any escape for him and his dear Lady, but as vain he found all his
employment there not having might to break out but only one bar, wherein
notwithstanding he strained his sinews to the uttermost. And that he rather
took out to use for other Damaetas having gathered together the first coming
sheepheards, did blabber out what he ha^ found in the Lady Philocleas
chamber, Pyrocles markingly harkned to all that Damaetas said, whose voice and
mind, acquaintance had taught him sufficiently to know. But when he assuredly
perceived that his being with the Lady Philoclea was fully discovered; and by
the folly or malice, or rather malicious folly of Damaetas her honor therein
touched in the hiest degree; remembering withal the cruelty of the Arcadian
laws which without exception did condemn al to death, who were found Damaetas
reported of them) in act of marriage without solemnity of marriage; assuring
himself besides the law, the King and the Queen, would use so much more hate
against their daughter, as they had found themselves sotted by him, in the
pursuit of their love; Lastly seeing they were not only in the way of death, but
fittly encaged for death, looking with a hearty grief upon the honor of love,
the fellows Philoclea, (whose innocent soul now enjoying his own goodness did
little know the danger of his ever fair then sleeping harbor) his excellent
wit strengthened with virtue but guided by love, had soon described to
himself a perfect vision of their present condition, wherein having presently
cast a resolute reckoning of his own part of the misery, not only the chief
but sole burden of his anguish consisted Philoclea. He saw the misfortune not
the mismeaning of his work, was like to bring that creature to end, in whom
the world as he thought did begin to receive honor he saw the weak
judgment of man, would condemn that as death deserving voice in her, which
had in troth never broken the bonds of a true living virtue, and how often his
Damaetas was gotten in, and to call back what might have been to a man of
wisdom and courage, caries but a vain shadow of discourse sometimes he could
not chose but with a dissolutio^ of his inward might lamentably consider with
what face he might look upon his (till then) joy Philoclea, when the next
light waking should deliver unto her, should perchance be the last of her
hurtles life. Damaetas as by his speech he found there was not, it might justly
appear that either Philoclea in defending her honor, or else he himself in
despair of atchieuing, had left his carcass proof of his intent but witness of
her clearenes, having a small while stayed upon the greatness of his resolution
and Pyrocles: never life for better cause, nor to better end was bestowed, for
if death be to follow this doing, which no death of mine could make me leave
undone, who is to die so justly as my self? And if I must die, who can be so fit
executioners as mine own hands? Which as they were accessaries to the doing,
so in killing me they shall suffer their own punishment. But then Damaetas
having carried away any thing, which he thought might hurt as tender a man as
himself, he could find no fit instrument which might give him a final
dispatch, at length making the more haste, least his Lady should awake,
taking the Iron bar, (which being sharper something at the one end, then the
other, he hoped joined to his willing strength, might break of the former
thread of mortallitie, truly said he, fortune thou have well perseuered
Philoclea, whose sweet soul had an early salutation of a Daphne, she came
running to Pyrocles, and finding his spirits something troubled with the fall;
she put by the bar that lay close to him, and strayning him in her Philoclea
with the most cruel torment that ever Lady suffered? Do you not yet persuade
your self that any hurt of yours is a death unto me? And that your death
should be my hell? Alas, if any sudden mislike of me (for other cause I see
none) have caused you to loath your self, if any fault or defect of mine
Pyrocles grieved with his fortune that he had not in one instant cut of all such
deliberation, thinking his life only reserved to be bound to be the unhappy
news teller: Alas said he, my only Star, why do you this wrong to God,
your self and me, to speak of faults in you, no, no, most faultlesse, most
perfet Lady, it is your excellency that makes me hasten my desired end, it is
the right I owe to the general nature, Damaetas speeches, confirming the rest
with a plain demonstration of their imprisonment. And then sought he new
means of stopping his breath, but that by Philocleas labor, above her force,
he was stayed to hear her. In whom a man might perceue, what small difference
in the working there is, betwixt a simple voidnes of evil, and a judicial
habit of virtue. For she, Pyrocles wayed and despised death, but with an
innocent guiltlessnes, not knowing why she should fear to deliver her
unstained soul to God, helped with the true loving of Pyrocles, which made her
think no life without him, did almost bring her mind to as quiet attending all
accidents, as the vnmastred virtue of Pyrocles. Yet having with a pretty palenes
(which did leave Pyrocles to my mind, which should be as often as I breathed?
Should these eyes guide my steps, that had seen your murder? should these
hands feed me that had not hindered such a mischief? Should this heart remain
within me, at Pyrocles, I have heard my father, and other wise men say that the
killing ones self is but a false coulloure, of true courage; proceeding rather
of fear of a further evil, either of torment or shame. For if it were a not
respecting the harm, that would likewise make him Pyrocles, who had that for
a law unto him, not to leave Philoclea in any thing unsatisfied, although he
still remained in his former purpose, and knew that time would grow short for
it, yet hearing no noise (the shepheardes Basilius) with settled and humbled
countenance, as a man that should have spoken of a thing that did not concern
himself, bearing eue^ in his eyes sufficient shows, that it was nothing but
Philocleas danger, which did any thing burden his heart, far stronger then
fortune, having with vehement embracinges of her, got yet some fruit of his
delayed end, he thus answered the wise innocence of Philoclea. Lady most
worthy not only of life, but to be the very life of al things Arcadia, but all
the face of the earth should receive, i^ such a Pyrocles, may ever have an
allowed place in your wise judgment, I am content to draw so much breath
longer, as by aunswearing the sweet objections you alleged, may bequath (as
I think) aright conceate unto you, that this my doing is out of judgment,
and not sprung of passion. Your father you say, was wont to say, that this like
action does more proceed good reason say, that the constant man abides the
painful surgery, for fear of a further evil: but he is content to wait for
death it self, but neither is true; for neither has the one any fear, but a
well choosing judgment; nor the other has any contentment, but only fear;
and not having a heart actiuely to perform a matter of pain, is forced
passiuely to abide a greater damage. For to do, requires a whole Philoclea,
since it is not for us to appoint that mighty Majesty, what time he will
help us: the uttermost instant is scope enough for him, to revoke every thing
to ones Pyrocles, I must needs protest unto you, that I can not think your
defense even in rules of virtue sufficient. Sufficient and excellent it were,
if the question were of two outward things, wherein a man might by natures
freedom determine, whether he would prefer shame to pain; present smaller
torment, to greater following, or no. But to this (besides the comparison of
any respect, whether the grief be less or more, is never to do that which he
can not assure himself is allowable before the everliving rightfulnes. But
rather is to think honors or shames, which stand in other men's true or
false judgments, pains or not pains, which yet never approach our souls, to
be nothing in regard Pyrocles was not so much persuaded as delighted, by her
well conceived and sweetly pronounced speeches; but when she had cloased her
pitiful discourse, and as it were sealed up her delightful Pyrocles life is
not well lost, for to preserve the most admirable Philoclea. Let that be if it
be possible written on my Tomb, and I will not envy Codrus honor. Philoclea
now brought to that she most feared, kneeled down unto him, and embracing so
his legs, that without hurting her, (which for nothing he would have done) he
could not rid himself from her, she did with all the coniuring words, which
the authority of love may Pyrocles came to her ears, which otherwise no death
could make her do. Will you Pyrocles even ouerwayed with her so wisely vttred
affection, finding her determinacion where he thought the consummating of all
beawties, very unworthily lay, suffering all his senses to devour up their
chiefest food, which he assured himself they should shortly after for ever be
deprived of: well, said he, most dear Lady, whose contentment I prefer
before mine own, and judgment esteem more then mine own, I yield unto your
pleasure. The gods send you have not won your own Philoclea fearing least
refusal would turn him back again, to his violent refuge, gave him a
certain countenance, that might show she did yield to his request, the latter
part whereof indeed she meant for his sake to perform. Philanax, with twenty
of the noblest personages of Arcadia after him, were come into the Lodge,
Philanax making the rest stay below, for the reverence he bare to womanhood,
as stilly as he could came to the door, and opening it, drew the eyes of
these two doleful lovers upon him. Philoclea cloasing again for modesty
sake, within her bed the Pyrocles took hold of his bar, minding at least to
dye, before the excellent Philoclea should receive any outrage. But Philanax
rested awhile upon himself, stricken with admiracion at the goodly shape of
Pyrocles, whom before he had never seen, and withal remembering besides
others the notable act he had done (when with his courage and eloquence, he
had saved Basilius, Philanax a strange medley, betwixt pity and revenge,
betwixt Pyrocles seeing him in such a muse, neither knowing the man, nor the
cause of his coming, but assuring himself, it was for no good, yet Philocleas
chamber? is it to defend her from such violence, as I might go about to offer
unto her? if it be so, truly your coming is vain, for her own virtue has
been a sufficient resistaunce, there needs no strength to be added to so
inuiolate chastetie, the excellency of her whatsouer, for having undertaken so
inexcusable presumption. Truly I bear such an accuser about me of mine own
conscience, that I willingly submit my self unto it. Only this much let me
demand of you, that you will be a witness unto the King what you hear me
say, and oppose your self, that neither his sudden fury, nor Philanax was
content to hear him out, not for any favor he owed him, but to see whether he
would reveal any thing of the original cause, and purpose of the kings death.
But finding it so far from that, that he named Basilius unto him, as
supposing him alive, thinking it rather cunning then ignorance: Young man, said
he, whom I have cause Philoclea, if it so fall out as you say, it shall be the
more fit for her years, and comedy for Arcadian, what reverent duty we owe to
any of that progeny. But, said he, come you with me without resistance, for the
one cannot avail, and the other may procure pity. Pity? said Pyrocles with a
bitter smiling, disdained, with so currish an answer: no, no, Arcadian,
Philanax with an inward storm, thinking it most manifest they were both, he at
least, of counsel with the Pyrocles, deceived by him that meant not to deceive
him. Then did Philanax deliver him into the hands of a noble man in the
company, every one desirous to have him in his Philanax himself stayed with
Philoclea, to see whether of her he might learn some disclosing of this former
conclusion. But she sweet Lady whom first a kindly shamefastnes had separated
from Pyrocles, (having been left in a more open view then her modesty would
well bear) then the Pyrocles was delivered out of the chamber from her, at the
first she was so surprised with the extreme stroke of the woeful sight, that,
like those that in their dreams are taken with some ougly vision, they would
fain cry for help, but have no force, so remained Pyrocles was quite drawn
from her eyes, and that her vital strength began to return unto her, now not
knowing what they did to Pyrocles, but (according to the nature of love)
fearing the worst, wringing her hands, and letting abundance of tears be the
first part of her eloquence, bending her Amber-crowned head over her bed side
to the hard-hearted Philanax: O Philanax, Philanax, said she, I know how much
authority you have with my father: there is no man whose wisdom he so much
esteems, nor whose faith so much he reposeth upon. Remember how Arcadia, spare
it not, although through me it has in deed never been dishonored. My only
suit is you will be a mean for me, that while I am suffered to enjoy this life,
I may not be separated from him, to whom the Gods have joined me, Philanax did.
This made him even to the depth of his heart receive a most vehement grief, to
see his master made as it were more miserable after death. And for himself,
calling to mind in what sort his life had been preserved by Philoclea, what
time taken by Amphialus he was like to suffer a cruel death, there was nothing
could have kept him from falling to all tender Mars, but she speaks of Venus.
O unfortunate master. This has been that fair devil Gynaecia: sent away
Arcadia. But at length thus unto her self he said: If your father, Madame,
were now to speak unto, truly there should no body be found a more ready
advocate for you, then my self. For I would suffer this fault, though very
great to be blotted out of my mind, by your former led life, your benefit
toward my self, Philoclea, that she desired him to tell her, what he meant to
speak in such dark sort unto her of her lord and father, whose displeasure
was more dreadful unto her, then her punishment: that she was free in her own
conscience, she had that saw her words written in the plain table of her fair
face, thought it impossible there should therein be contained deceit: and
therefore so much the more abashed: Why, said he, Madame, would you have me
think, you are not of conspiracy with the Princess Pamelas flight, and your
fathers death? with that word the sweet Lady Philoclea, said she, now in deed I
may well suffer all conceit of hope to dye in me. Dear father where was I,
that might not do you my last service before soon after miserably following
you? Philanax perceived the demonstracion so lively and true in Arcadia: what
they will determine of you, I know not, for my part your speeches would much
prevail with Philoclea: whatsoever you determine of him, do that likewise to
Philanax feeling his heart more and more mollifieng unto her, renewed the image
of his dead master in his fancy, and using that for the spurs of his
reue^gefull choler, went suddenly, without any more speech, from the desolate
Philanax leaving good guard upon the Lodge, went himself to see the order of
his other prisoners, whom even then as he issued, he found increased by this
unhoped means.

The noble Pamela having delivered over the burden of her fearful cares to
the Musidorus rose from her, enraged betwixt the doubt he had what the^e men
would go about, and the spite he conceived against their ill-pleasing presence.
But the clownes, Musidorus. Whom as soon as they saw turned toward them, they
full well remembered it was he, that accompanied with Basilius, had come to the
succor of Zelmane: and had left among some of them bloody tokens of his
valor. As for Pamela, they had many times seen her. Thus first sturred up
with a rusticall revenge against him, and then desire of spoil, to help their
miserable wants, but chiefly thinking it was the way to confirm Musidorus. Who
being before hand as much enflamed against them, gave them so brave a welcome,
that the smart of some made the rest stand further off, crying and prating
against Musidorus. Who finding them some already touch, some fall so near his
chiefest life Pamela, that in the end some one or other might hap to do an
vnsuccourable mischief, setting all his hope in despair, ran out from his
Lady among them. Who straight like so many swyne, when a hardy mastife sets
upon them, dispersed Musidorus was straight upon him: and parting with his
sword one of his legs from him, left him to make a roaring lamentation that
his morter-treading was marred for ever. A third finding his feet too slow,
as well as his hands too weak, sodaynely turned back, beginning to open his
lips for Musidorus blade was come between his jaws into his throat, and so
the poor man rested there for ever with a very evil mouthfull of an answer.
Musidorus in this furious chafe would have followed some other of these
hateful wretches, but that he heard his Lady cry for help, whom three of
this villainous crew, had (whiles Musidorus followed their fellows) compassing
about some trees, suddenly come upon and surprised, threatening to kill her if
she cried, and meaning to convey her out of sight, while the Prince was making
his bloud-thirstie chase. But she that was resolved, no worse thing could fall
unto her, then the being deprived of him, on whom she had established all her
comfort, with a pitiful cry fetched his eyes unto Musidorus, discharged
himself of his only defense, when he saw it stood upon the instant point of
his Ladies life. And holding up his noble hands to so unworthy audience, O
Arcadians, it is I that have done, you the wrong, she is your Princess (said
he) she never had will to hurt you, and you see she has no power. Use your
choler upon me that have better deserved it, do not your selves Basilius as
pledges of their surety: and there wanted not which cried the safest way was to
kill them both; to such an unworthy Musidorus: when the villain that had his
leg cut off, came scrawling toward them, and being helped to them by one of
the company, began with a growning voice, Musidorus, but that the much loss
of blood helped on with this Pamela tearing her hear, and falling down among
them, sometimes with all the sort of humble prayers, mixed with promises of great
good turns, (which they knew her state was able to perform) sometimes
threatening them, that if they those two lovers inward working virtue, settled
their cruel hearts to this ge^tler course they took the two horses, and having
set upon them their princely prisoners, they returned toward the lodge. The
villains having decked al their heads with laurel branches, as thinking they
had done a notable act, singing and showting, ran by them in hope to have
brought them the same day again to the King. But the time Musidorus taking the
tender hand of Pamela, and bedewing it with his teares^ in this sort gave an
issue to the swelling of his hearts grief. Thessalia should have yielded unto
you, am now like to become a wretched instrument of your discomfort? Alas how
contrary an Pamela, although full of cares of the unhappy turning of this
matter, yet seeing the grief of Musidorus only stirred for her, did so tread
down all other motions with the true force of virtue, that she thus answered
him, having first kissed him, which before she had never done either love so
commanding her, which doubted how long they should enjoy one another;
Musidorus said she, a greater wrong, do you to your self, that will torment
you thus with grief, for the fault of fortune. Since a man is bound no further
to himself, then to do wisely; chance is only to trouble them, that stand
upon chance. But greater is the wrong (at least if any thing that Musidorus,
it is your self I love, which can no more be diminished by these showers of
evil hap, then flowers are marred with Musidorus in whom indeed honor is,
does honor me? Nothing bred from my self can discomfort me: and fools
opinions I will not reckon as dishonor. Musidorus looking up to the stars, O
mind of minds said he, the living power of all things which called a life,
grant me ability to deserve at this Ladies hands the grace she has showed
unto me; grant me wisdom to know her wisdom, and goodness so to increase my
love of her goodness, that all mine own chosen desires, be to my self but
second to her determinations. What soever I be, let it be to her service, let
me herein Musidorus, Pamela, could not choose, but accord the conceit of
their fortune to Musidorus hand, speaking softly unto him as if she had feared
more any body should be witness of her weakness, then of any thing else she had
said, you see said she my Prince and only Lord, what you work in me by your
much greuing for me. I pray you think I have no joy but in you, Musidorus
finding the authority of her speech confirmed with direct necessity, the
first care came to his mind was of his dear friend and cousin Pyrocles: with
whom long before he had concluded what names they should bear, if upon any
occasion they were forced to give them selves out for great men, and yet not
make them selves fully known. Now fearing least if the Princes should name him
for Musidorus, the fame of their two being together, would discover Pyrocles;
holding her hand betwixt his hands a good while together: I did not think
Musidorus should entitle himself Paladius, Prince of Iberia, and Pyrocles
should be Daiphantus of Lycia.

Musidorus he keeping a woman's habit is to use no other name then Zelmane, but
I that find it best, of the on side for your honor, you went away with a
Prince and not with a shepherd: of the other side accompting my death less
evil, then the betraying of that sweet friend of mine, will take this mean
betwixt both, and using the name of Paladius if the respect of a Prince will
stop your fathers fury, Musidorus until Pyrocles fortune being some way
established, I may freely give good proof that the noble contrie of Thessalia
is mine: and if that will not mitigate your fathers opinion to me wards (nature
I hope working in your excellencies will make him deal well by you) for my
part the image of death is nothing fearful unto me: and this good I shall
have reaped by it, that I shall leave my Paladius. But as long as her years
now of good number be counted among the living, she may joy her self with
some possibility of my return. Pamela promising him upon no occasion ever to
name him, fell into extremytie of weping, as if her eyes had been content to
spend all their seeing moistnes, now that there was speech of the loss of that,
which they held as their chiefest light. So that Musidorus was forced to
repair her good Musidorus as he rid among them, (of whom they had no other
hold but of Pamela) thinking it want of a well squared judgment, to leave any
mean unassayed of saving their lives, to this purpose spoke to his unseemly
gardians, using a plain kind of phrase to make his speech the more credible.
My masters said he, there is no man that is wise but has in what soever he
does some purpose whereto he directes his Pamela being the undoubted
enheritrixe of this state, if she shall hereafter seek to revenge your wrong
done her) shall be continually cast in your teeth, as men dead by the law;
the honester sort will disdain your company and your children shall be the more
basely reputed of, and you yourselues in every slight fault hereafter, as men
once condemned, aptest to be overthrown. Now if you Pamela thither ward,
whether she was going: first you need not doubt to adventure your fortunes
where she goes, and there shall you be assured in a country as good and rich
as this, of the same manners and language, to be so far from the conceate of
a pardon, as we both shall be forced to acknowledge, we have received by your
means what soever we hold dear in this life. And so for reward judge
Arcadians, shall have the praise in continuing in your late valiant attempt,
and not basely be brought under a halter for seeking the liberty of Arcadia.
These words in their minds, who did nothing for any love of goodness, but
only as their senses presented greater shows of proffit, began to make
Philanax had sent out to the search of Pamela came gallowping unto them;
marueyling who they were that in such a general mourning, durst singe joyful
tunes, and in so public a ruin were the laurel tokens of victory. And that
which seemed straungest, they might see two among them unarmed like prisoners,
but riding like captains. But when Pamela. Then glad they had by happ found
that which they so little hoped to meet withal, taking these clownes (who
first resisted them, for the desire they had to be the deliuerers of the two
excellent prisoners, learning that they were of those rebels, which had made
the dangerous uproar, as well under color to punish that, as this their last
Philanax: to Philocleas chamber, had overtaken Pyrocles, whom before he had
delivered to the custody of a noble man of that country. When Pyrocles led
toward his prison saw his friend Musidorus, with the noble Lady Pamela in
that in expected sort returned, his grief, (if any grief were in a mind
which had placed every thing according to his natural worth) was very much
augmented, for besides some small hope he had, if Musidorus had once been
clear of Arcadia, by his dealing and authority to have brought his only
gladsome desires to a good issue: The hard estate of his friend did no less
nay rather Musidorus was brought by the soldiers near unto Philanax, Pyrocles
not knowing whether ever after he should be suffered to see his friend, and
determining there Musidorus, he embrased him as fast as he could in his
arms. And kissing his cheeks, O my Palladius said he, let not our virtue now
abandon us; let us prove our minds are no slaves to fortune, but in adversity
Daiphantus aunsweared Musidorus (seeing by his apparel his being a man was
revealed) I thank you for this best care of my best part. But fear not, I
have kept too long company with you to want now a through determination of
these things, I well know there is nothing evil but within us, the rest is
either natural or accidental. Philanax finding them of so near
acquaintance, Pyrocles, by name Simpathus, leaving a trusty servant of his
own to give dilligent watch to what might pass betwixt them. No man that
has ever passed through the school of affection, needs doub^ what a tormenting
grief it was to the noble Pamela, to have the company of him taken from her, to
whose virtuous company she had bound her life. But waying with her self, it was
fit for her honor, Musidorus even unto the tent, whether he and Pyrocles were
led. Then with a countenance more princely then she was wont, according to
the wont of hiest hearts (like the Palm tree striving most upward, when he
is most Philanax to bring her to her father and mother, that she might render
them account of her doings. Philanax showing a sullaine kind of reverence
unto her, as a man that honored her as his, Masters heir, but much misliked
her for her, in his conceit, dishonorable proceedings, told her what was
past, rather to answer her, then that he thought she was ignorant of it.
But her eyes which let fall many tears, she well declared. But in the end
remembering how necessary it was for her, not to loose her self in such an
extremity, she strengthened her well created heart, and stoutely demanded
Philanax, what aucthoritye then they had to lay hands of her person, who
being the undoubted Philanax answered, her Grace knew the ancient laws of
Arcadia bare, she was to have no swaye of government till she came to one and
twentye years of age, or were married. And married I am replied the wise
Princess, therefore I demand your dew allegeaunce. The gods forbid said
Philanax, Arc^dia Arcadia, was even that day to be judged of, before the
body were removed, to receive his princely funerals. After that past, she
should have such obedience, as by the Laws was Philanax fearing least thereby
some commotion might arise, or at least a hinderaunce of executing his
masters murderers, which he longed after more then any thing, hasted her
Philoclea, Pamela protesting they laid violent hands of her, and that they
entered into rebellious attemptes against her. But hye time it was for Philanax
so to do, for already was all the whole multitude fallne into confused and
dangerous deuisions.

There was a notable example, how great dissipations, Monarchall government
are subject unto. For now their Prince and guide had left them, they had not
experience to rule, and had not whom to obaye. Public matters had ever been
privately governed, so that they had no lively taste what was good the wise
careful. This composicion of conceytes, brought forth a dangerous tumulte,
which yet would have been more dangerous, but that it had so many parts,
that no body well knew against whom chiefly to oppose themselves. For some
there were that cried to have the state altered, and governed no more by a
Prince; marry in the alteration, many would have the Lacedemonian Athenian,
where the peoples voice held the chief aucthoritye. But these were rather the
discoursing sort of men, then the active, being a matter more in imaginacion
then practice. But they that went nearest to the present case, (as in a
country that knew no government, without a Prince) were they that strove,
whom they Pamela presently to enjoy it: some disdayning that she had as it
were abandoned her own Country, enclining more to Philoclea; and there wanted
not of them, which wished Gynaecia were delivered, and made Regent till Pamela
were worthily married. But great multitudes there were, which having been
acquainted Philanax, meant to establish him as Lieutenant of the state: and
these were the most populer sort, who judged by the commodities they felt.
But the principal men in honor and might, who had long before enuyed his
greatness with Basilius, did much more spurn against any such preferment of
him. For yet before their envy had some kind of breathing Damaetas he might
easily be deceived in men's valewe. But now if the Princes choice, by so many
mouths should be confyrmed, what could they object to so rightly esteemed an
excellencye? They therefore were disposed, sooner to yield to any thing, then
to his raising: and were Philanax) to stop those actions, which otherwise
they could not but think good. Philanax himself, as much hindered by those,
that did immoderatly honor him, (which brought both more envy, and suspicion
upon him) as by them that did manifestly resist him, (but standing only upon
a constant desire of justice, and a clear conscience) went forward stoutly in

But among the Noble men, he that most openly set himself against him, was
named Timantus, a man of middle age, but of extreme ambition, as one the great
stroke Philanax carried among the people, thought it his readyest way of
ambition, to join with him: which though his pride did hardly brook, yet the
other vice carrying with it a more apparent object, prevailed over the weaker,
so that with those liberal protestacions of friendship, which men that care
not for Arcadian estate. Wishing him, that since he loved his master, because
he was his master, which showed the love began in himself, he should rather
now occasion was presented, seek his own good substancially, then affect the
smoke Philanax, who had limited his thoughts in that he esteemed good, (to
which he was neither carried by the vain tickling of uncertain fame, nor from
which he would be Timantus went with an inward spite from him, whom before he
had never loved; and measuring all men's marches by his own pace, rather
thought it some Philanax, (as that he would have all to himself alone) then
was any way taken with the lou^ly beawtie of his virtue; whose image he had so
quite defaced in his own soul, that he had left himself no eyes to behold
it, but stayde waiting fit opportunity, to execute his desires both for
himself, and against Philanax, which by the bringing back of Pamela, the
people being Philanax, and making a kind of convocation of Arcadia bredd no
man but Philanax? is she become a stepmother to all the rest, and has given
all her blessings to Philanax? Or if there be men amongst us, let us show we
disdain to be servant to a servant. Let us make him know, we are far
worthier not to be slaves, then he to be a master. Think you he has made
such haste in these matters, to give them in his life, so he would now persevere
to abuse his name, after his death. O notable affection, for the love of the
father to kill the wife, and disenherit the children! O single minded modesty
to aspire to no less then to the princely Diadem! No, no, he has vired all
this while, but to come the sooner to his affected end. But let us remember
what we be, in quallitie his equals, in number far before him, let Timantus
speech, and were ready to execute it: when Philanax came among them, and with
a constant but reverent behavior, desired them they would not exercise private
grudges, in so common a necessitye. He acknowledged himself a man, and a
faultye man, to the clearing or satisfyeng of which, he would at all times
submit himself, since his end was to bring all things to an upright
judgment, it should evil fit him to fly the judgment. But said Timantus
railing speech (who whatsoever he finds evil in his own soul, can with ease
lay it upon another) make me loose your good favor. Consider that all well
doing, stands so in the middle betwixt his two contrary evils, that it is a
ready matter to cast a slanderous shade upon the most approved virtues. Who
has an evil tongue, can call severity, cruelty, and faithful Arcadia. Now I
request you, for your own honors sake, and require you by the duty you owe
to this estate, that you do presently (according to the laws) take in hand,
the chastizement

As Philanax was speaking his last words, there came one running to him, with
open mouth, and fearful eyes, telling him, that there were a great number of
the people, which were bent to take the young men out of Sympathus hands, and
as it should seem by their acclamacions, were like enough to proclayme them
Philanax (speaking alowde, and looking with a just anger upon the other noble
men) it is now season to hear Timantus idle slanders, while strangers become
our Lords, and Basilius murderers sit in his throne. But who soever is a true
Arcadian, let him follow me. With that he went toward the place he heard of,
followed by those that had ever loved him, and some of the Timantus, who in the
mean time was conspiring by strong hand to deliver Gynaecia, of whom the
weakest guard was had. But Philanax where he went, found them all in an uproar,
which thus was fallne out. The greatest multitude of people, that were come to
the death of Basilius, were the Mantineans, as being the nearest City to the
lodges. Among these, Kalander, he that not long before had been host to the
two Princes, whom though he knew not so much as by name, yet besides the
obligacion he stood bound to them in, for preserving the lives of his son or
nephewe, their noble behavior had bred such love in his heart toward them,
as both with tears he parted from them, when they left him (under promise to
return) and did keep their jewels and apparel as Mantineans unto him, he
told them, all the praises of those two young men, swearing he thought the
gods had provided for them better, then they themselves Basilius children must
enjoy the state; who since they had chosen, and chosen so as all the world
could not mende their choice, why should they resist Gods doing, and their
Princesses pleasure? This was the only way to purchase quietness without blood,
where otherwise they should at one instant, crown Pamela with a Arcadia, when
they shall allot such a governor unto it. This spoken by a man grave in years,
great in authority, near allied to the Prince, and known honest, Mantineans,
that with one voice they ran to deliver the two Princes. But Philanax came in
time to withstand them, both sides yet standing in arms, and rather wanting a
beginning, then minds to enter into a bloody conflict. Which Philanax
foreseeing, thought best to remove the prisoners secretly, and if need were,
rather without form of justice to kill them, Sympathus (the noble man that
kept them) was so stricken in compassion, with their excellent presence, that
as he would not falsifye his promise to Philanax, to give them liberty, so yet
would he not yield them to himself, fearing he would do them violence. Thus
tumult upon tumult


The fourth Eglogues.
THE Shepherds finding no place for them in these garboyles, to which their
quiet hearts (whose highest ambition was in keeping themselves up in goodness)
Arcadias beawtyes. And there looking upon the Suns as then declining race,
the poor men sat pensive of their present miseries, as if they found a
wearines Geron (who as he had longest tasted the benefits of Basilius
government, so seemed to have a special feeling of the present loss) wiping
his eyes and long white bearde bedeawed with great dropps of tears, began in
this sort to complain. Alas poor sheep, said he, which hitherto have
enjoyed your fruitful pasture, in such quietness, as your Basilius is
deceased. Alas sweet pastures! Shall soldiers that know not how to use you,
possess you? Shall they that can Arcadian language be Lords over your
Shepherds? For alas with good cause may we look for any evil, since Basilius
our only strength is taken from us. To that all the other Shepherds present
uttered pitiful voices, especially the very borne Arcadians. For as for the
other, though humanity moved them to pity humane cases, especially in a
Prince, under whom they had found Agelastus, notably noted among them, as well
for his skill in Poetry, as for an austerely mayntayned sorrowfulnes, wherewith
he seemed to despise the works of nature, framing an universal complaint in
that universal mischief, uttered

SInce wayling is a bud of causefull sorrow,
Since sorrow is the follower of evil fortune,
Since no evil fortune equals public damage:
Now Princes loss has made our damage public,
Sorrow, pay we to thee the rights of Nature,
And inward grief seal up with outward wailing.
Why should we spare our voice from endless wailing,
Who justly make our hearts the seat of sorrow?
In such a case where it appears that nature
Does add her force unto the sting of fortune:
Choosing alas! this our theater public,
Where they wo^ld leave trophies of cruel damage,
Then since such powers conspired unto our damage
(Which may be known, but never helped with wailing
Yet let us leave a monument in public
Of willing tears, torn hairs, and cries of sorrow.
For lost, lost is by blow of cruel fortune
Arcadias gemme the noblest child of nature,
O nature doting old, o blinded nature,
How have thou torn thy self! sought thine own damage!
In granting such a scope to filthy fortune,

Cast thy stepmother eyes upon our sorrow,
Public our loss: so, see, thy shame is public.
O that we had, to make our woes more public,

A yelling voice, and hearts composed of sorrow,
Breath made of flames, wits knowing naught but damage,
Our sports murdering our selves, our musiques wailing,
Our studies fixed upon the fal^es of fortune.
No, no, our mischief grows in this vile fortune,
That private pains can not breath out in public
The furious inward griefs with hellish wailing:
But forced are to burden feeble nature

And sorrow feed, feeding our souls with sorrow.
Since sorrow then concludes all our fortune
With all our deaths show we this damage public.

It seemed that this complaint of Agelastus had awaked the spirits of the
Arcadians, astonished before with exceedingnes of sorrow. For he had scarcely
ended, when diverse of them offered to follow his example, in be wayling the
general loss of that Arcadians. Among the rest one accounted good in that
kind, and made the better by the true feeling of sorrow, roared out a song of
lamentation, which (as well as might be) was gathered up in this form:
Who most the silly shepherds pipe did pryse,
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
And you o trees (if any life there lies

The strange resounde of these my causefull cries:
And let my breath upon your branches cleave,
My breath distinguished into words of woe,
That so I may signs of my sorrow leave.
But if among your selves some one tree grow,
That aptest is to figure misery,
Let it embassage bear your grieves to show.
The weeping Mirrhe I think will not deny
Her help to this, this iustest cause of plaint.
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
And thou poor Earth, whom fortune does attaint
In Natures name to suffer such a harm,
As for to loose thy gemme, and such a Saint,
Upon thy face let coaly Ravens swarm:
Let all the Sea thy tears accounted be:
Thy bowels with all killing metals arm.
Let gold now r^st, let Diamonds waste in thee:
Let pearls be wan with woe their damme does bear:
Thy self henceforth the light do never see.
And you, o flowers, which sometimes Princes were,
Till these strange altrings you did hap to try,
Of Princes loss your selves for tokens rear,
Lilly in mourning black thy whitenes die:
O Hyacinthe let Ai be on thee still.
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
O Echo, all these woods with roaring fill,
And do not only mark the accents last,
But all, for all reach out my wailefull will:
One Echo to another Echo cast
Sound of my griefs, and let it never end,
Till that it has all woods and waters past.
Nay to the heavens your just complaining send,
And stay the stars inconstant constant race,
Till that they do unto our dolours bend:
And ask the reason of that special grace,
That they, which have no lives, should live so long,
And virtuous souls so soon should loose their pla^e?
Ask, if in great men good men do so thronge,
That he for want of elbowe room must die?
Or if that they be skante, if this be wrong?
D^^ Wisdom this our wretched time epsy
In one true chest to rob all Virtues treasure?
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
And if that any counsel you to measure
Your doleful tunes, to them still playning say,
To well felt grief, plainte is the only pleasure.
O light of Sun, which is entit'led day,
O well thou do that thou no longer bidest;
For mourning light her blackeweedes may display.
O Phoebus with good cause thy face thou hidest,

Fould with this sight, while thou thy chariot guidest,
And well (me thinks) becomes this vaultie sky
And stately tomb to cover him deceased.
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
O Philomela with thy breast oppressed
By shame and grief, help, help me to lament
Such cursed harms as cannot be redressed.
Or if thy mourning notes be fully spent,

For I to teach the world complainte am bent.
You dimmy clouds, which well employ your stayning
This cheerful air with your obscured cheer,
Witness your woeful tears with daily rayning.

In shape, which by man's eye might be perceived;
Virtue is dead, now set the triumph here.
Now set thy triumph in this world, bereaved
Of what was good, where now no good does lie;

O notes of mine your selves together tie:
With too much grief me thinks you are dissolved.
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply,

Within it self, and never tastes end:
But mankind is for aye to naught resolved.
The filthy snake her aged coat can mende,
And getting youth again, in youth does flourish:

The very trees with grafting we can cherish,
So that we can long time produce their time:
But Man which helps them, helpless must perish.
Thus, thus the minds, which over all do clime,

Must finish then by deaths detested crime.
We last short while, and build long lasting places:
Ah let us all against foul Nature cry:
We Natures works do help, she us defaces.

That she her child, I say, her best child kills?
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
Alas, me thinks, my weakened voice but spilleth,
The vehement course of this just lamentation:
Me thinks, my sound no place with sorrow fills.
I know not I, but once in detestation
I have my self, and all what life contains,
Since Death on Virtues fort has made invasion.
One word of woe another after traineth:
Ne do I care how r^de be my invention,
So it be seen what sorrow in me reigns.
O Elements, by whose (men say) contention,
Our bodies be in living power maintained,
Was this man's death the fruit of your dissension?
O Phisickes power, which (some say) has restrained
Approach of death, alas thou helpest meagerly,
When once one is for Atropos distrained.
Great be Physicians brags, but aid is beggarly,
When rooted moisture fails, or grows dry,
They leave off all, and say, death commes too eagerly.
They are but words therefore that men do buy
Of any, since God AEsculapius ceased.
Your doleful tunes sweet Muses now apply.
Justice, justice is now (alas) oppressed:
Bountifulnes has made his last conclusion:
Goodness for best attire in dust is dressed.
Shepherds bewail your uttermost confusion;
And see by this picture to you presented,
Death is our home, life is but a delusion.
For see alas, who is from you absented?
Absented? nay I say for ever banished
From such as were to dye for him contented?
Out of our sight in turn of hand is vanished
Shepherd of shepherds, whose well settled order
Private with wealth, public with quiet garnished.
While he did live, far, far was all disorder;
Example more prevailing then direction,
Far was homestrife, and far was foe from border.
His life a law, his look a full correction:
As in his health we healthful were preserved,
So in his sickness grew our sure infection.
His death our death. But ah; my Muse has swarued,
From such deep plaint as should such woes descrie,
Which he of us for ever has deserved.
The style of heavy heart can never fly
So high, as should make such a pain notorious:
Cease Muse therefore: thy dart o Death apply;
And farewell Prince, whom goodness has made glorious.


Many were ready to have followed this course, but the day was so wasted, that
only this riming Sestine delivered by one of great account among them, could
obtain favor to be heard.

Arcadias cl^arest light:
Farewell o pearl, the poor man plenteous treasure:
Farewell o golden staff, the weak man's might:
Farewell o Joy, the ioyfulls only pleasure.
Wisdom farewell, the skillesse man's direction:

For what place now is left for our affection,
Now that of purest lamp is quenched the light,
Which to our darkened minds was best direction?

Now death has swallowed up our worldly pleasure,
We Orphans made, void of all public might?
Orphans in deed, deprived of fathers might:

In our well-doing placing all his pleasure,
Still studying how to us to be a ligh
As well he was in peace a safest treasure:
In war his wit and word was our direction.
Whence, whence alas, shall we seek our direction!
When that we fear our hateful neighbors might,
Who long have gap't to get Arcadians treasure.
Shall we now find a guide of such affection,

And make his pain to keep us safe his pleasure?
No, no, for ever gone is all our pleasure;
For ever wandering from all good direction;

For ever lamed of our sured might;
For ever banished from well placed affection;
For ever robbed of all our royal treasure.

And in our wailfull naming him our pleasure:
Let hating of our selves be our affection,
And unto death bend still our thoughts direction.
Let us against our selves employ our might,

Farewell our light, farewell our spoiled treasure:
Farewell our might, farewell our daunted pleasure:
Farewell direction, farewell all affection.
The night began to cast her dark Canopie over them, and they even weary
with their woes bended homewardes: hoping by sleep forgetting them selves, to
Philanax.

The end of the fourth Book.
THE FIFTH BOOK OF THE COUNTESS OF PEMBROKES
Arcadia to feel the pangs of uttermost peril (such convulsions never
coming, but that the life of that government draws near his necessary
periode) when to the honest and wife Philanax, Macedonian Gentleman, who in
short, but pithye manner delivered unto him, that the renowned Euarchus, King of
Macedon, purposing to have visited his old friend and confederate the King
Basilius, Phil^nax having entertained the Gentleman, as well as in the midst
of so many tumultes he could, pausing awhile with himself, considering how
it should not only be unjust, and be attempted, of which late repentance
should after be but a simple remedy: he judged best first to know how the
peoples minds would sway to this determinacion. Therefore desiring the
Gentleman to return to the King his master, and to beseech him (though with
his pains) to stay for an hour or two, where he was, till he had set things
in better order to receive him: he himself went first Kalander and the
principal Mantineans, who were most opposite unto him; desiring them, that as
the night had most blessedly stayed them from entering into civil blood, so
they would be content in the night to assemble the people together, to hear
some news, which he was to deliver unto them. There is nothing more desirous
of novelties, then a man that fears his Timantus ambition, as Philanax
worthiness. As for Kalander and Sympathus, as in the one a virtuous friendship
had made him seek to advance, in the other a natural commiseration had made
him willing to protect the excellent (though unfortunate) prisoners, so were
they not against this convocation. For having nothing but just desires in them,
they did not mistrust the iustifyeng Timantus labored to have withdrawn them
from this assemblye, saying, it was time to stop their ears from the ambitious
charms of Philanax. Let them first deliver Gynaecia, and her daughters, which
were fit persons to hear, and then they might begin to speak. That this was
but Philanax coming, to li^ke broyle upon broyle, because he might avoid the
answering of his trespasses, Philanax would propose unto them: Who, like a man
whose best building was a well-framed conscience, neither Cyclopes or
Cannibals, to desire that our Princes body, which has thirty years
maintained us in a flourishing peace, be not torn in pieces, or devoured among
you, but may be suffered to yield it self, which never was defiled Arcadians,
renowned for your faith to Prince, and love of Country, but as to sworn
enemies of this sweet soil, I am to desire you, that at least, if you will
have strangers to your Princes, yet you will not deliver the seignory of this
goodly Kingdom to your noble Kings murderers. Lastly, I have reason, this day
had his seat in your minds, and left his footsteps in your actions? But in
troth I love you too well, to stand long displayeng your faults: I would you
your selves did forget them, so you did not fall again into them. For my part,
I had much rather be an orator of your praises. But now (if you will suffer
attentive Euarchus King of Macedon. A Prince with whom our late master did
ever hold most perfect alliance. He, Basilius alive, but now willing to do
honor to his death. Surely, surely the heavenly powers have in so full a time
bestowed him on us, to unite our divisions. For my part therefore I wish, that
since among our selves we can not agree in so manifold partialities, we do put
the ordering Philanax first named Euarchus landing, there was a muttring murmur
among the people, as though in that evil ordered weakness of theirs he had come
to Philanax proposition, at length Sympathus was the first that allowed it,
then the rest of the Noblemen, neither did Kalander strive, hoping so excellent
a Prince could not but deal graciously with two such young men, whose
authority joined to Philanax, all the Timantus still blinded with his own
ambitious haste (not remembering factions are no longer to be trusted, then the
factious may be persuaded it is for their own good) would needs strive
against the stream, exclaiming against Philanax, that now he showed who it
was, that would betray his country to strangers. But well he found, that who
is too busy in the foundation of an house, Timantus that made the first
mutinous oration, to strengthen Timantus, without their consent, had not gone
about to deliver Gynaecia? And thus enflaming one another against him, they
threw him out of the assembly, and after pursued him with stones and staves,
so that with loss of one of his eyes, sore wounded and beaten, he was feign to
fly to Philanax feet, for succor of his life: giving a true lesson, that
vice it self is forced to seek Philanax who hated his evil, but not his
person, and knew that a just punishment might by the manner be unjustly done;
remembering withal, that al^hough herein the peoples rage might have hit
rightly, yet if it were nourished in this, no man knew to what extremities it
might extend it self: with earnest dealing, and employeng the uttermost of his
authority, he did protect the trembling Timantus. And then having taken a
general oath, that they should in the noneage of the Princess, or till these
things were settled, yield full obedience to Euarchus, so far as were not
prejudicial to the laws, customs, Arcadia: and having taken a particular
bond of Sympathus (under whom he had a servant of his own) that the
prisoners should be kept close, without conference with any man: he himself
honorably accompanied, with a great number of torches went to the king
Euarchus, whose coming in this sort into Arcadia had thus fallen out.

The woeful Prince Plangus receiving of Basilius no other succors but only
certain to conduct him to Euarchus, made all possible speed toward
Byzantium, where he understood the King, having concluded all his wars with
the winning of that town, had now for some good space made his abode. But
being far gone on his way, he received certain intelligence, that Euarchus
was not only some Macedon, but since was gone with some haste to visit that
coast of his country that lay toward Italy. The occasion given by the Latins,
who having already gotten into their hands, partly by conquest, and partly by
confederacy, the greatest part of Italy, and long gaped to devour Greece
also (observing the present opportunity of Euarchus absence, and Basilius
solitarines, Greece) were even ready to lay an unjust gripe upon it, which
after they might beawtifie with the noble name of conquest. Which purpose
though they made not known by any solemn denouncing of war, but
contrariwise gave many tokens of continuing still their former amity: yet the
stayeng of his subjects ships, traffiquing Euarchus (not unacquainted with
such practizes) first to suspect, then to discern, lastly, to seek to prevent
the intended mischief. Yet thinking war never to be accepted, until it be
offered by the hand of necessity, he determined Greece by uniting their
strength, to make timely provision against this peril: by many reasons making
them see, that, though in respect of place some of the^ might seem further
removed from the first violence of the storm, yet being imbarqued subject.
Having thus prepared the body, and assured the heart of his country against
any mischief that might attaint it, he then took into his careful
consideration the external parts, giving order both for the repairing and
increasing his navy, and for the fortifying of such places, especially on the
sea coast, as either Aulon a principal port of his realm, when the poor
Plangus extremely wearied with his long journey (desire of succouring Erona no
more relieuing, then fear of not succouring her in time aggravating his
travail) by a lamentable narratio^ of his childre^s Greece, how vehemently it
moved to grief and compassion others, only not blind to the light of virtue,
nor deaf to the voice of their country, might perchance by a more Euarchus
sorrow, to the one in nature, to both in affection, a father, and judging the
world so much the more unworthily deprived of those excelle^cies, as himself
was better judge of so excellent worthiness, ca^ no otherwise be shadowed out by
the skilfullest pencel, the^ by covering it over with the veil of silence. And
in deed that way himself took, with Plangus perfect instruction of all things
concerning Plexirtus and Artaxia, with promise not only to aid him in
delivering Erona, but also with vehement protestation, never to return into
Macedon, til he had pursued the murderers to death: he dispatched with speed
Byzantium, commanding the governor to provide all necessaries for the war
against his own coming, which he purposed should be very shortly. In this
ship Plangus would needs go, impacient of stay, for that in many days before he
had understood nothing of his Ladies estate. Soon after whose departure, news
was brought to Euarchus, that all the ships detained in Italy were returned.
For the Latins Euarchus procedings their intent to be frustrate (as before by
his sudden return they doubted it was discovered) deeming it no wisdom to
show the will, not having the ability to hurt, had not only in free and
friendly manner dismissed them, but for the time wholly omitted their enterprise,
attending the opportunity of fitter occasion. By means whereof Euarchus, rid
from the cumber of that war (likely otherwise Byzantium. And now followed with
fresh winds he had in short time run a long course, when on a night
encountered with an extreme tempest, his ships were so scattered, that
scarcely any two were left together. As for the Kings own ship, deprived of
all company, sore bruised, and Laconia: for no other country could have shown
the like evidence of unnatural war. Which having long endured between the
nobility and the Helotes, and once compounded by Pyrocles, under the name of
Daiphantus, imediately upon his departure had broken out more violently then
ever before. For the King taking the opportunity of their captains absence,
refused to perform the conditions of peace, as extorted from him by rebellious
violence. Whereupon they were again deeply entered Euarchus (though a
stranger unto them) thought it not safe there to leave his person, where
neither his own force could be a defense, nor the sacred name of Majesty, a
protection. Therefore calling to him an Arcadian (one that coming with Pl^ngus
had remained with Euarchus, desirous to see the wars) he demanded of
Euarchus, and honor to Basilius (to w^om he knew he should bring a most
welcome gueste) told him, that if it pleased him to commit himself to
Arcadia, (a part whereof lay open to their vewe) he would Basilius. The
present necessity much prevailed with Euarchus, yet more a certain virtuous
desire to try, whether by his authority he might withdraw Basilius from
burying himself alive, and to employ the rest of his old years in doing
good, the only happy action of man's life. For besides the universal case of
Greece deprived Arcadian people, who were in worse case then if death had taken
away their Prince. For so yet their necessity would have placed some one to
the helm: now, a Prince being, and not doing like a Prince, keeping and not
exercising the place, they were in so much more evil case, as they could not
provide for their evil. These rightly Euarchus to take his iourny toward the
desert, where arriving within night, and understanding to his great grief the
news of the Princes death, he waited for his safe conduct from Philanax: in
the mean time taking his rest under a tree, with no more affected pompes, then
as a man that knew, how soever he was exalted, the beginning and end of his
body was Philanax as soon as he was in sight of him, lighting from his horse,
presented himself unto him in all those humble behauiours, which not only the
great reverence of the party but the conceit of ones own misery, is wont to
frame. Euarchus raze up unto him with so gracious a countenance, as the
goodness of his mind had long exercised him unto: careful so much more to
descend in all courtesies, as he Philanax, as soon as by near looking on him,
he might perfectly behold him, the gravity of his countenance, and years,
not much unlike to his late deceassed, but ever beloved master brought his
form so lively unto his memory, and revived so all the thoughts of his
wonted joys within him, that in steed of speaking to Euarchus, he stood a
Basilius, that he thought no age was timely for his death. But at length
taking the occasion of his own weeping, he thus did speak to Euarchus. Let
not my tears most worthily renowned Prince make my presence unpleasant, or my
speech unmarked of you. For the iustnes of the cause, takes away the blame of
any weakness in me; and the affinity that the Euarchus to say, I am but the
representer of all the late flourishing Arcadia, which now with mine eyes does
weep, with my tongue does complain, with my knees does lay it self at your
feet, which never have been unready to Arcadia finding her self in these
desolate terms, does speak, and I speak for her, to thee not vainly
puissant Prince, that since now she is not only robbed of the natural support
of her Lord, but so suddenly robbed, that she has not breathing time to stand
for her safety: so unfortunately, that it does appall Basilius blood; the
manner to the ancient prescribing of their laws. For the rest without
exception, Euarchus, which made him the more diligent in marking his speech,
and after his speech take the greater pause for a perfect resolucion. For as of
the one side, he thought nature required nothing more of him then that honor,
lastly the tribute due to his own mind with the daily offering of most virtuous
actions: so of the other he wayed the just reproach that followed those, who
easily enter into other folks business, with the opinion might be conceived,
love of seignorie rather then of justice, had made him embarke himself, into a
matter nothing pertaining to him, especially in a time when ernest occasion of
his Arcadia, the necessity of Arcadia might justly demand some fruit of
abiding. To this secreat assurance of his own worthiness (which although it be
never so well clothed in modesty, yet always lives in the worthyest minds)
did much push him forward saying unto himself, the treasure of those inward
gifts he had, were bestowed by the heavens upon him, to be beneficial
Philanax most urgent peticion. Although long experience has made me know, all
men (and so Princes which be but men) to be subject to infinite casualties, the
very Euarchus more the^ cause: their own eyes will be perhaps more curious
judges, out of hearesay they may have builded many conceits, which I can not
perchance will not perform, then will undeserved Philanax was not of the
modern minds, who make suitors magistrates: but did ever think the unwilling
worthy man, was fitter then the undeserving desirer. Therefore the more
Euarchus drew back, not to make any weak excuses of his weakness, since
so many examples had well proved his mind, was strong to ouerpasse the
greatest troubles, and his body strong enough to obey his mind; and that so
long as they were joined together, he knew Euarchus would think it no
wearisome exercise, to make them vessels Eu^rchus his mind, (already inclined
to enter into any virtuous action) Philanax embassage. No man thinking the
matter would be well done, without he had Philanax return, having on his right
hand the King Euarchus on whom they had now placed the greatest burden of
their fears, with joyful shoutes and applawding acclamations, they made him
and the world quickly know that one man's sufficiency is more auailable then
ten thousands multitude. So evil balanced be the extremities of popular
minds: and so Euarchus had been borne of the princely blood of Arcadia, or that
long and well acquainted proof had engrafted him in their country, so flocked
they about this stranger, most of them alredie, from dejected fears, rising
to ambitious considerations, who should Philanax for his succeeding pain,
others likinge Euarchus aspect, and as they judged his age by his face, so
judging his wisdom by his age, Euarchus passed through them like a man that
did neither disdain a people nor yet was any thing tickled with their
flatteries. But always holding his own, a man Neptune had not more force to
appease the rebellious wind, then the admiration of an extraordinary virtue
has, to temper a disordered multitude. He being raised up upon a Arcadians,
by my L. Philanax, that you have with one consent, chosen me to be the judge of
the late evils happened: orderer of the present disorders: and finally protector
of this country, til therein it be seen what the customs of Arcadia require.
He could say no further, being stopped with you, the proof in me. But because
it many times falls out, we are much deceived in others, we being the first to
deceive ourselves, I am to require you, not to have an ouershooting expectation
of me: the most cruel adversary of all honorable doings. Nor promise
yourselues wonders, out of a sudden lyking: but remember I am a man, that is
to say a creature, whose reason is often darkened with error. Seconly, Greece,
and particular of Arcadia (wherein I must confess I am not unacquainted) I
will not only see the passed evils duly punished, and your weal here after
established; but for your defense in it, if need shall requeir, I will employ
the forces and treasures of mine own country. In the mean time, this shall be
the first order I will take, that no man under pain of grievous punishment,
name me by any other name but protector of Arcadia. Euarchus speech heard, who
now by Philanax (that took the principal care, of doing all due services
unto him) was offered Euarchus, seeing the day begin to discloase his
comfortable beauties, desiring nothing more, then to join speed with justice,
willed Philanax, Philanax who now thought in himself, he approached by the just
revenge he so much desired, went withal care and diligence to perform his
charge. But first it shall be well to know, how the poor and princely
prisoners, passed this tedious night. There was never tyrante exercised his
rage with more grievous Gynecia did crusifie her own soul, after the
guiltines of her heart, was surcharged with the sodainenes of her husbands
death, for although that effect came not from her mind yet her mind being
evil, and the effect evil, she thought the justice of God, had for the
beginning of her pains copled the^ together. This incessantly boiled in her
breast, but most of al, when Philanax having cloasely imprisoned her, she was
left more freely to suffer, the fierbrands Philanax was haling her Pluto, and
the magistrates of that infernal region, contending in great debate, to what
eternal punishment they should allot her. But long her dreaming would not hold,
but that it would fall upon Zelmane: to whom she Pyrocles Zelmane, would she
say (not knowing how near he himself was to as great a danger) now shall
thou glut thy eyes, with the dishonored death of thy enemy! Enemy alas
enemy, since so thou haste well showed, thou will have me account thee,
could thou not as well have given me Gynecia, no less sorrowful, though
less ragefull were the minds of the Princess Pamela, and the Lady Philoclea,
whose only advantages were, that they had not consented to so much evil, and
so were at greater peace with themselves: and that they were not left alone,
but might mutually bear part of each others woes. For when Philanax not
regarding Pamelas princely protestations, had by force left her under guard
with her sister, and that the two sisters were matched, as well in the disgraces
of fortune, as Pamela in her iournying weeds now converted to another use:
Philoclea only in her night gown, which she thought should Pamela had learned
of Musidorus) being so minded, as they would ever make both their fortunes
one) it did more unite, and so strengthen their lamentation: seeing the one
could not be miserable, but that it must necessarily make the other
miserable also. That, therefore was the first matter their sweet mouths
delivered, the declaring the passionate beginning, troblesome proceeding, and
Philoclea, who as she was in years younger, and had never lifted up her mind
to any opinion of souereignetie, so was she the apter to yield to her
misfortune; having no stronger debates in her mind, then a man may say a
most witty childehoode is wont to nourish: as to imagine with her self, why
Philanax and the other noble men, should deal so cruelly by her, that had
never deserved evil of any of them? And how they could find in their hearts,
to imprison such a personage, as she did figure Pyrocles, whom she thought
all the world was bound to love, as well as she did? But Pamela, although
endewed with a virtuous mildenes, yet the knowledge of her self, and what was
due unto her, made

So that she joined the vexacion for her friend, with the spite to see her
self as she thought rebelliously detayned, and mixed desirous thoughts to
help, with reuengefull thoughts if she could not help. And as in pangs of
death, the stronger heart feels the greater torment, because it does the more
resist to his oppressor; so Pamela to know, that an Eagle when she is in a
Cage, must not Pyrocles and Musidorus, were recommended to so strong a guard,
as Musidorus would feel such a motion to his friend, and his unworthy case,
that he would fall into such kind speeches. My Pyrocles would he say, how
unhappy may I think Thessalia, that has been as it were, the middle way to
this evil estate of yours? For if you had not been there brought up, the Sea
should not have had Pyrocles educacion, should be a step to his overthrow, if
humane chances can be compted an overthrow to him, that stands upon virtue.
Oh excellent Musidorus answered Pyrocles, how do you Pyrocles said
Musidorus, as their course never alters, so is there nothing done by the
vnreacheable ruler of them, but has an everlasting reason for it. And to say
the truth of these things, we should deal ungratefully with nature, if we
should be forgetful receyuers of her gifts, and so diligent Auditors of the
chances we the cause of their creation, and to many men (for in this time,
place, and fortune, it is lawful for us to speak gloriously) it has been
behouefull, that we should live. Since then eternity is not to be had in this
conjunction, what is to be lost by the separation, but time? which since it
has his end, when that is once come, all what is past is nothing: and by the
protracting nothing gotten, but labor and Pirocles, that if we complain of
this our fortune, or seem to our selves faulty, in having one hurt the other,
we show a repentance of the love we bear to these matchless creatures, or at
least a doubt, it should be ouerdeerely bought, which Philoclea. Take the
pre-eminence in all things, but in true loving, answered Musidorus, for the
confession of that no death shall Pirocles soberly smiling, I perceive we
shall have a debate in the other world, if at least there remain any thing of
remembrance in that place. I do not think the contrary said Musidorus,
although you know, it is greatly held, that with the death of body and
senses (which are not only the beginning, but dwelling and nourishing of
passions, thoughts Pirocles, I easily yield, that we shall not know one
another, and much less these passed things, with a sensible or passionate
knowledge. For the cause being taken away, the effect follows. Neither do I
think, we shall have such a memory, as now we have, which is but a relicke
of what kind of light we now in this life see. What kind of knowledge we
now have, yet now we do not only feel our present being, but we conceive
what we were before we were borne, though remembrance make us not do it, but
knowledge, and though we are utterly without any remorse of any misery, we
might Musidorus looking with a heavenly joy upon him, sang this song unto him,
he had made before love turned his muse to another subject.

SInce natures works be good, and death does serve

Since fear is vain, but when it may preserve,
Why should we fear, that which we cannot fly?
Fear is more pain, then is the pain it fears,

While each conceate, an ouglie figure bears,
Which were not evil, well vew'd in reasons light.
Our owly eyes, which dimmed with passions be,

Let them be clearde, and now begin to see,
Our life is but a step, in dustie way.
Then let us hold, the bliss of peaceful mind,
Since this we feel, great loss we cannot find.
Thus did they like quiet Swannes, sing their own obsequies, and virtuously
enhable their minds against all extremities, which they did think would fall
upon them, especially resolving, that the first care they would have, should
be by taking the fault upon themselves, to clear the two Ladies, of whose
case (as Kalander, seeking all means how to help them, had endeavored to
speak with them, and to make them know who should be their judge. But the
curious servant of Philanax forbad him the entrye, upon pain of death. For
so it was agreed upon, that no man should have any conference Kalander was
constrained to retire himself, having yet obtained thus much, that he would
deliver unto the two Princes, their apparel and jewels, which being left with
him at Mantinea, (wisely considering that their disguised weeds, which were
all as then they had, would make them more odious in the sight of the judges)
he had that determined to maintain the names of Palladius and Daiphantus, as
before it is mentioned. Then gave they themselves to consider, in what sort
they might defend their causes, for they thought it no less vain to wish
death, then cowardly to fear it, till something before morning, a small
slumber taking them, they were by and by after callde up to come to the
answer, of no less then their Euarchus called unto him Philanax, and willed
him to draw out into the midst of the green (before the chief lodge) the
throne of judgment seat, in which Basilius was wont to sit, and according to
their customs, was ever carried with the Prince. For Euarchus did Philanax,
and therein Euarchus did set himself all clothed in black, with the
principal men, who could in that sodainenes provide themselves of such
mourning rayments. The whole people commanded to keep an orderly silence of
each side, which was duly observed of them, partly for the desire they had to
see a good conclusion of these matters, and partly stricken with admiracion,
Euarchus, as at the greatness of the cause, which was then to come in question.
As for Philanax, Euarchus would have done him the honor to sit by him, but he
excused himself, desiring to be the accuser of the prisoners in his masters
behalf; and therefore since he made himself a party, it was not convenient
for him to sit in the judicial place. Then Philanax, whose love and faith, did
descend from his master to his children, and only desired, the smart should
light upon the others, whom he thought guilty of his death and dishonor,
alleging for this, that neither wisdom would, they should be brought in
presence of the Pamela, he protested the laws of Arcadia would not allow any
judgment of her, although she her self, were to determine nothing, till age
or marriage enabled her. Then the Kings body being laid upon a Table, just
before Euarchus, and all Pyrocles was to plead for his life before that
throne, in which throne lately before he had saved the Kings life. But first
was Gynecia led forth, in the same weeds that the day and night before she
had worn, saving that in stead of Zelmanes garment her face, most part of her
goodly hear (on which her hands had laid many a spiteful hold) so lying upon
her shoulders, as a man might well see, had no artificial carelesnes. Her eyes
down on the ground, of purpose not to look on Pyrocles face, which she did
not so much shun, for the unkindness she conceived of her Pyrocles came out
led by Sympathus, clothed after the Greek manner, in a long coat of white
velvet, reaching to the small of his leg, with great buttons of Diamonds all
along upon it: His neck without any collar, not so much as hidden with a
ruff, did pass the whitenes of his garments, which was not much in fashion
unlike to the crimson raiment, our Knights of Musidorus. Who had upon him, a
long cloak, after the fashion of that, Getulian purple (which yet was far
the meaner in price and estimacion) but of the right Tyrian purple, which was
nearest to a color betwixt our murrey and skarlet. On his head, which was
black and curled, he ware a Persian Tiara, all set down with rows of so rich
Rubies,

In this sort with erected countenaunces, did these unfortunate Princes suffer
themselves to be ledd, showing aright by the comparison of them and Ginecia,
how to diverse persons, compassion is diversely to be sturred. For as to Ginecia,
Musidorus was in stature so much higher then Pyrocles, as commonly is gotten by
one years growth. His face now beginning to have some tokens of a beard, was
composed to a kind of manlike beawtie. His color was of a well pleasing
brownenes, and the features of it such, as they carried both delight and
majesty: his countenance severe, and promising a mind much given to thinking.
Pyrocles of a pure complexion, and of such a cheerful favor, as might seem
either a woman's face on a boy, or an excellent boys face in a woman. His look
gentle and bashful, which bred the more admiracion, having Musidorus was the
more goodly, and Pyrocles the more lovely. But as soon as Musidorus saw
himself so far forth led among the people, that he knew to a great number of
them his voice should be heard, misdoubting their intention to the Princess
Pamela, (of which he was more careful then of his own life,) Arcadians, said
he, that you can forget the natural duty you owe to your Princess Pamela?
has this soil been so little beholding to her noble Auncesters? has so long
a time rooted no surer love in your hearts to that line? Where is that faith to
your Princes blood, which has Arcadians were wont to flourish in, whose nature
is to render to every one his own? Will you now keep the right from your
Prince, who is the only geuer of judgment, the keye of justice, and life of
your laws? Do you hope in a few years, to set up such another race, Basilius
children with ungratefulness, the very poison of manhood? Will you betray your
long settled reputation, with the foul name of traitors? Is this your mourning
for your Kings death, to increase his loss with his daughters misery? Imagine
your Prince do look out of the heavens unto you, what do you think he could
wish more at Pamela? Pamela the just enheretrix of this Country, Pamela whom
this earth may be happy, that it shall be hereafter said she was borne in
Arcadia. Pamela in Arcadians, be not so wilfully robbed of your greatest
treasure, make not Basilius daughters be strangers unto you. Lastly, howsoever
you bar her from her public souereigntie, (which if you do, little may we
hope of equity where rebellion reigns) yet deny not that child's right unto
her, that she Musidorus desirous as much as in passing by them he could, to
move the people to tender Pamelas fortune. But at length by that they came to
the judgment Sympathus and his guider had greatly satisfied him, with the
assurance they gave him, this assembly of people had neither meaning nor
power, to do any hurt to the Princess, whom they all acknowledged as their
sovereign Lady. But that the custom of Arcadia was such, till she had more
years, the state of the country to be guided by a Protector, under whom, he
and his fellow were to receive their judgment. That eased Musidorus heart of
his most vehement care, Pyrocles as soon as the Queen of the one side, he and
Musidorus of the other, were stayed before the face of their judge, (having
only for their bar the Table on which the Kings body lay) being nothing less
vexed with the doubt of Philoclea, then Musidorus was for Pamela, in this sort
with a lowly behavior, and only then like a suppliant, Philoclea (to whose
unstained virtue it has been my unspeakable miserye, that my name should
become a blot) if she be accused, is most unjustly accused of any dishonorable
fact, which by my means she may Pyrocles demand, longing (for the love
generally was borne Philoclea) to know what they might hope of her. Euarchus
though neither Philocleas behauior, in this matter: which being cleared by
Pyrocles, and but weakly gaynesayd by Philanax (who had framed both his own
and Damaetas evidence most the vestall nonnes, so to repaye their touched
honor of her house, with well observing a stryctt profession of chastity.
Although this were a great preiudicating of Pyrocles case, yet was he
exceedingly joyous of it, being assured of his Ladies life; and in the depth of
his mind not sorry, that what end soever he had, none should obtain the
after enjoying that Jewel, whereon he had set his lives happiness. After
Philoclea, (the laws of Arcadia bearing, that what was appointed by the
magistrates in the noneage of the Prince, could not afterward be repealed)
Euarchus still using to himself no other name but protector of Arcadia,
commanded those that had to say against the Queen Gynecia to proceed,
because both her estate required she Philanax incontinently stepped forth,
and showing in his greedy eyes, that he did thirst for her blood, began a
well thought on discourse of her (in his judgment) execrable wickedness. But
Gynecia standing up before the judge, casting abroad her arms, with her eyes
hidden under the breadth Philanax, as he was entering into his inuectiue
oration. Stay stay Philanax said she, do not defile thy honest mouth, with
those dishonorable speeches thou art about to utter, against a woman, now
most wretched, lately thy mistress. Let either the Basilius death. They were
these hands that gave unto him that poisonous potion, Arcadia, it was I and
none but I, that hastened his aged years, to an unnatural end, and that have
made all his people orphans, of their royal father. I am the subject that have
killed my Prince, I am the wife that have murdered my husband, I am a degenerate
woman, an vndoer of this country, a shame of my children. What would thou
have said more Oh Philanax? and all this I grant, there rests then nothing
else to say, but that I desire you, you will appointe quickly sum to ridd me
of my life, rather then these hands, which else are destenied unto it, and
that indeed it may be done with such speed as I may not long dye in this
life, which I have in so great horror: with that she crossed her arms, and
sat down upon the ground, attending Gynecias words and behavior sturred
their hearts to a doleful compassion, neither in troath could most of them in
their judgments tell, whether they should be more sorry for her fault or
her misery: for the loss of her estate, or loss of her virtue. But most were
most moved, with that which was under there eyes: the sense Euarchus, brought
them to a silent waiting his determination, who having well considered the
abomination of the fact, attending more the manifest proof of so horrible a
trespass; confessed by her self, and proved by others; then any thing
relenting to those tragical phrases of hers (apter to stir a vulgar pity,
then his mind, which Arcadian statutes, as for the everlasting Gynecia, who
had already settled her thoughts, not only to look but long for this event,
having in this time of her vexation, found a sweetness in the rest she hoped by
death, (with a countenance witnessing she had before hand so passed through
all the degrees of sorrow, that she had no new look to figure forth any
more) raze up and offered forth her faite hands to be bound or led well
deserving. Thus the excellent Lady Gynecia, having passed five and thirty
years of her age, even to admiration of her beautiful mind and body, and
having not in her own knowledge, ever spotted her soul with any wilful vice,
but her imoderate love of Zelmane, was brought, first by the violence of that
ill answered passion, and then by the dispayring conceit, she took of the
judgment of God Euarchus ask Philanax, whether it were he that would charge
the two young prisoners, or that some other should do it, and he sit
according to his estate, as an assistant Philanax told him as before he had
done, that he thought no man could lay manifest the naughtines of those two
young men, with so much either truth or zeal as himself, and therefore he
desired he might do this last service to his faithfully beloved master, as to
prosecute the traitorous causers of his death and dishonor; which being done,
for his part he meant to give up all dealing in Philanax thus being redye to
speak, the two Princes were commanded to tell their names who answered
according to their agreements, that they were Daiphantus of Lycia, and
Palladius Prince of Iberia. Which when they had said, they demanded to know by
what authority, they could judge of them, since they were not only forryners
Arcadia laws, were to have their force upon any were found in Arcadia: since
strangers have scope to know the customs of a country, before they put them
selves in it: and when they once are entered, they must know, that what by many
was made, must not for Arcadia, was to acknowledge them but as private men,
Euarchus: whom the strange and secreate working of justice, had brought to be
the judge over them, in such a shadow, or rather pit of darkness, the wormish
mankind lives, that neither they know how to foresee, nor what to fear: and
are but like tenisballs, tossed by the racket of the hyer powers. Philanax
should be hard against Pyrocles, whom they termed Daiphantus, and that heard,
the others cause should follow, and so receive together such judgment, as
they should be found to have deserved. But Philanax that was even short
breathed at the first, with the extreme vehemency he had to speak against
them, stroking once or twice his forehead, and wiping his eyes, (which either
wept, or he Pyrocles, as if he had proclaimed all hatefullnes against him,
humbly turning to Euarchus, (who with quiet gravity, showed great attention)
he thus began his oration. That which all men, who take upon them to accuse an
other, are wont to desire (most worthy protector) to have many proofs of my
faults in them they seek to have condemned: Zelmane, this Daiphantus, this
what you will, (for any shape or title he can take upon him, that has no
restrainte of shame) having understood the solitatie life my late master
lived, and considering how open he had laid himself to any traiterous
attempt, for the first mask of his falsehoode, disguised himself like a
Basilius murder, for the executing of which with more facility, this young
nymph of Dianas bringing up, feigned certain rites she had to perform, so
furious an impiety had carried him, from all remembrance of goodness, that he
did not only not fear the Gods, as the beholders and punishers of so ungodly
a villainy, but did blasphemously use their sacred holly name, as a minister
unto it. And forsooth a Cave hereby was chosen, for the temple of his
devotions, a Cave of such darkness, as did prognosticate Basilius. By what
means he trained him thither, alas I know not, for if I might have known it,
either my life had accompanied my master, or this fellows death had preserved
him. But this may suffice, that in the mouth of this Cave, where this traitor
had his lodginge and chapple, Gynecia found by the dead corpse of her husband,
newly empoysoned, apparelled in the garments of the young Lady, and reddy no
question to have fled to some place, according to their consorte, but that she
was by certain honest-shepeheards arrested: while in the mean time, because
their Amazon, was violently gotten into the chamber of the Lady Philoclea,
whereby the mingling as much as in him lay) of her shame, with his misdeede, he
might enforce her to be the accessory to her fathers death, and under the
countenance of her and her sister (against whom they knew we would not
rebel) seize as it were with one gripe into their Damaetas hand, to enclose
him in there, where with as much fortification as in a house could be made, he
thought himself in most security. Thus see you most just judge, a short and
simple story of the infamous misery, fallen upon this contrie. In deed infamous,
since Basilius, as the rauishing of Philoclea, (for those two parts I
establish of my accusation) who is of so incredulous a mind, or rather who
will so stop his eyes from seeing a thing cleerer then the light, as not to
hold Gynecia (a woman though wicked, yet witty) would have attempted and
achieved an enterprise, no less hazardous then horrible, without having some
councellor in the beginning, and some comforter in the performing? Had she, who
showed her thoughts, were so ouerruled with some strange desire, Gynecias
action dye with her self, what can all the earth answer for his coming
hither? Why alone, if he be a Prince? How so richly Iewelled if he be not a
prince? Why then a woman if now a man? Why now Daiphantus, if then Zelmane?
Was all this play for nothing, or if it had an end, what end but the end of
my dear master? Shall we doubt so Gynecia, such fained favor to the over
soon beguiled Basilius, a Cave made a lodging, and the same lodging made a
temple of his religion, lastly such changes and trauerses, as a quiet Poet
could scarce fill a poem withal, were directed to any less scope, then to
this monstrous murder? O snakie ambition, which can wind thy self in so many
figures, to slide thither Daiphantus tell me, what excuse can you find for the
changing your lodging, with the Queen that very instant she was to finish
her execrable practice? How can you cloak the lending of your cloak unto her,
was all that by chance too? Had the stars sent such an influence unto you, as
you should be just Philoclea: wherewith as if it had well become his
womanhoode, he came brauing to the judgment seat, indeed our laws appointe
not so cruel a death (although death too) for this sacte as for the other. But
Philocleas virtue, did not astonish thee? O woeful Arcadia, to whom the name of
this mankind curtisan, shall ever be remembered as a procurer of thy greatest
loss! But too far I find my passion, yet honest passion man's age, let I say
his youth, be some cause of compassion. If he have not every way sought the
overthrow of human society, if he have done any thing like a Prince, let
his naming himself a Prince, breed a reverence of his base wickedness. If
he have not broken all laws of hospitality, and broken them in the most
detestable degree that can be, let his being a guest, be a sacred Philoclea her
honor, by taking out of the world her dishonor, and think that at this day,
in this matter are the eyes of the world upon you, whether any thing can sway
your mind from a Philanax had uttered the uttermost of his malice, he made
sorrow the cause of his conclusion. But while Philanax was in the course of
his speech, and did with such bitter reproaches Pyrocles, it was well to be
seen, his heart was unused to bear such injuries, and his thoughts such, as
could arm themselves better against any thing then shame. For sometimes
blushing, his blood with diverse motions coming and going, sometimes cloasing
his eyes, and laying his hand over them, sometime giving such a look to
Philanax, as

My accusors tale, may well bear witness with me, most rightful Judge, in how
hard a case, and environed with how many troubles, I may esteem my self. For
if he, who shows his tongue, is not unacquainted with railing, was in an agonye
in the beginning of his speech, with the multitude of matters he had to lay
unto me, wherein notwithstanding the most evil could fall unto him, hoping
that by your easy hearing of me, you will show, that though you hate evil,
yet you wish men may prove themselves not evil; so in that he has said,
you will not way so much what he has said, as what he has proved,
remembering, that truth is simple and naked, and that if he had guided
Palladius and I, being enflamed with love, (a passion far more easily
reprehended, then refrayned) to the two peerless daughters of Basilius, and
understanding, how he had secluded himself from the world, that like
Princes, there was no access unto him, we disguised our selves, in such
forms, as might soonest bring Palladius, had such event of his doings, that
with Pamelas consent he was to convey her out of the thraldom she lived in,
to receive the subjection of a greater people then her own, until her fathers
consent might be obtained. My fortune was more hard, for I bare no more love to
the chaste Philoclea, then Basilius deceived in Philoclea: till this pollicye I
found, taking, under color of some devotions, my lodging, to draw Basilius
thither, with hope to enjoy me, which likewise I revealed to the Queen, that
she might keep my place, and so make her husband see his error. While I in the
mean time, being delivered of them both, and having locked so the doors,
Philoclea would condescend to go with me, there should be none to hinder our
going. I was made prisoner there, I know not by what means when being
repelled by her divine virtue, I would faynest have escaped. Here have you the
thread to guide you in the Labyrinth, this man of Basilius, and violence offered
to the inuiolate Philoclea. For the first, O heavenly gods, who would have
thought any mouth could have been found so mercenary, as to have opened so
slight proofs of so horrible matters? his first Argument is a question who
would imagine that Ginecia would accomplish Ginecias confession, I never
imagined the King was dead. And for my part so vehemently, and more like the
manner of passionate, then guilty folks, I see, the Queen persecute her
self, that I think condemnation may go too I never believed) yet how
unjustly should that aggrauate my fault. She found abroad I within doors (for
as for the wearing my garment I have told you the cause) she seeking as you
say to escape, I locking my self in a house: without perchance the
conspiracy of one poor stranger, might greatly enable her attempt, or the
fortification of the Lodge (as the trim man alleged) might Arcadia. And see
how treacherously he seeks to draw from me, my chiefest clearing, by
preventing the credit of her words, wherewith she had wholly taken the fault
upon her self. A honest and impartial examiner, her words may condemn her,
but may not absolve me. Thus void of all probable allegacion, the crauen
crows upon my affliction, not leaving out any evil,

Now come I to the second part of my offense, toward the young Lady, which
howsoever you term it, so far forth as I have told you, I confess, and
for her sake heartily lament. But if herein I offered force to her, love offered
more force to me. Let her beawtie be compared to my years, and such effects
will be found no miracles. But since it is thus as it is, and that justice
teaches us not to love punishment, Basilius tomb, to have guiltless blood
sprinkled upon it, and much more may a Judge ouerway himself in cruelty,
then in clemency. It is hard, but it is excellent, where it is found, a right
knowledge, when correction is necessary, when grace does more avail. For my
own respect, if I thought in wisdom I had deserved death, I would not desire
life: Philoclea, whose violence wrought violent effects in me: with that he
finished his speech, casting up his eyes to the Judge, and crossing his hands,
which he held in their length before Philanax like a watchful adversary
curiously marked all that he said, saving that in the beginning he was
interrupted by two Letters were brought him from the Princess Pamela, and the
Lady Philoclea: who having all that night considered and bewailed their estate,
careful for their mother likewise, of whom they could never think so much
evil, but considering with themselves that she assuredly

The humble hearted Philoclea wrate much after this manner.
Arcadia for his loss, be accurssed of the whole earth and of all posterity.
He is a great Prince, I speak unto you that which I know, for I have seen
most evident testimonies. Why should you hinder my advancement? who if I have
past my childhood hurtlesse to any of you, if I have refused no body to do what
good I could, if I have often mitigated my fathers Philoclea to use her own
hands to kill one of your Kings children.


Pamelas Letter (which she meant to send to the general assembly of the
Arcadian Nobility,) (for so closely they were kept, as they were utterly
ignorant of the new taken orders) was thus framed.
IN such a state my Lords you have placed me, as I can neither write nor be
silent; to write? What to write is as hard for me to say, as what I may not
write, so little hope have I of any success, and so much has no injury been
left undone to mewards. To whom to write, where may I learn, since yet I wot
not how to entitle you? Shall I call you my Souereignes? set down your laws
that I may do you homage. Shall I fall lower, and name you my fellows? show me
I beseech you the Basilius heir, name her self your Princess? Alas I am your
prisoner. But whatsoever I be, or whatsoever you be, o all you beholders of
these doleful lines, this do I signifye unto you, and signifye it with a heart,
that shall ever remain in that opinion. The good or evil you do to the
excellent Prince was taken with me, and after by force from me, I will ever
impute Pamela, Basilius daughter.


Many blots, had the tears of the sweet Ladies made in their letters, which
many times they had altered, many times torn, and written anewe, ever thinking
some thing either wanted, or were too much, or would offend, or which was
worst, would breed denial: but at last, the day warned them to dispatch,
which they accordingly did, and calling one of their guard (for no body else
was suffered to come Philanax, who had placed him there, delivered them both to
him, (what time Pyrocles Euarchus just mind, either the Princesses might be
endaungered, or the prisoners preserved, of which choice he knew not which to
think the worst) that he would not himself reed them over, doubting his
own heart might be mollified, Pirocles, and as soon as he had ended, with a
very willing heart desired Euarchus he might accept the combat: although it
would have framed but evil with him, Pyrocles having never found any match
near him, besides Musidorus. But Euarchus made answer, since bodyly strength
is but a servant to the mind, it were very barbarous and preposterous, that
force should be made judge over reason. Euarchus who knew what they could
say, was already said, taking their arguments into his mind, cammaunded him
to proceed against the other prisoner, and that then he would sentence them
both together. Philanax nothing the milder for Pyrocles purging himself, but
rather (according to the nature of arguing, especially when it is bitter) so
Musidorus, being so ouergone with rage that he forgate in this oration his
precise method of oratory. Behold most noble protector, to what a state
Arcadia is come, since such manner of men, may challenge in combat the
faithfullest of the nobility, and having merited the shamefullest of all
deaths, dare name in marriage the Princesses of Dorus, who with Pallas help
pardie, are lately grown Palladius. Too much this sacred seat of justice,
grauntes unto such a fugitive bondslaue Basilius murder has been the cause of
their coming, Basilius murder, they have most trecherously has traitorously
contrary to his alleageaunce (having made himself a servant and subject)
attempted the depriving this contry of our natural Princess: and therefore by
all right must receive the punishment of traitors. This matter is so assured as
he himself will not deny it, being taken and brought back in the fact. This
matter is so odious in nature, so shameful to the world, so contrary to all
laws, so Musidorus while Philanax was speaking against his Basilius in the
late war with Amphialus importing no less then his daughters lives, and his
states preservation: were not we the men that killed the wild beasts which
otherwise had killed the Princesses, if we had not succourd them? Consider if
it please you, where Daiphantus rape, or my treason, if the sweet beauties of
the earth, had then been devoured? Either think them now dead, or remember
they live by us. And yet full often this telltale can acknowledge the loss
they should have by their taking away, while maliciously he over passes who
were their preseruers, neither let this be spoken of me, as if I meant to
balance this evil with that good, for I must repose our lives in the
daughters, when we had killed the father. But as this Gentleman thinks to
win the reputation of a copious talker by leaving nothing vnsaide which a
filthy mind can imagine, so think I (or else all words are vain) that to
wise men's judgment, our cleerenes in the Kings death is sufficiently
notorious. But Simpathus, but as for Kalander, every thing was spoken either by
or for his own dear guestes, moved an affect in him: sometimes tears,
sometimes Euarchus, who showed in his face no motions, either at the ones or
other speech, letting pass the flowers of rhetoric, and only marking
whether their reasons tended, having made the question to be asked of Gynecia,
who Damaetas, with Miso and Mopsa (who by Philanax order had been held in most
cruel prison) to make a full declaration, how much they knew of these passed
matters, and then gathering as assured satisfaction to his own mind as in
that case he could; not needing to take leisure for that, whereof a long
practice had bred a well grounded habit in him, with a voice of gesture
directed to the universal assembly, in this form pronounced sentence. This
weighty matter, whereof presently we are to determine, does at the first
consideration yield two important doubts. The first whether these Arcadia, and
so into the Arcadian orders, but into domestical services, and so by making
them selves private, deprived themselves of respect due to their public
calling. For no proportion it were of justice, that a Greece, and municipall
statutes of this kingedome. For although out of them, these came, and to them
must indeed refer their offspringe, yet because philosophical discourses,
stand in the general consideration of things, they leave and mighty against
presumptio^s bring forth some probable answers, which they do principally
fortefie with the Queens acknowledging her self only culpable. Certainly as
in equallitie of conjectures, we are not to take hold of the worse, but rather
to be glad we may find any hope that mankind is not grown monstrous, (being
Daiphantus were sooner disapointed of his purpose of conueying away the Lady
Philoclea, then he that persuaded the Princess Pamela to fly her country,
and accompanied her in it: yet seeing in causes of this nature, the will by the
rules of justice stands for the Grecian laws, by the loss of the head, as
a most execrable theft. For if they must dye, who steal from us our goods,
how much more they, who steal from us that, for which Phenician Europa Helene,
has taught them, what destroying fires have grown of such sparckles. And
although Helene was a wife, and this but a child, that booteth not since the
principal cause of marrying wives is, that we may have children of our own.
But now let us see how these young men (truly for their persons worthy of
pity, if they have rightly pitied themselves) do go about to mittigate all
speeches affirm they love that, which an ill governed passion makes them to
follow. But love may have no such privilege. That sweet and heavenly uniting
of the minds, which properly is called love, has no other knot but virtue,
and therefore if it be a right love, it can never slide into any action that is
not virtuous. The other and indeed more effectual reason is that they may be
married unto them Pamela, and requires the benefit of a councellor, who has
place of free persuasion; and the reasonable excuse of a servant, that did but
wait of his mistres. Without all question, as counselors Dametas, and then to
the King, and therefore if not by Arcadia laws, yet by household orders,
bound to have done nothing without his agreement. Thus therefore since the
deeds accomplished by these two, are both abominable and inexcuseable. I do
in the behalf of justice, and by the force of Arcadia laws pronounce, that
Daiphantus shall be thrown Palladius shall be behedded the time before the
sun set: the place in Mantinea: the executioner Dametas: which office he
shall execute all the days of his life, for his beastly forgetting the
careful duty he owed to his charge. This said he turned himself to
Philanax, and two of the other noble men, commanding them to see the judgment
presently performed. Phil^nax more greedy then any hunter of his pray, went
strait to lay hold of the excellent prisoners, who casting a farewell look
one upon the other, represented in their faces as much unappalled constancy, as
the most excellent courage can deliver, in outward graces. Yet if at all there
were any show of change in them, it was that Pyrocles was something nearer to
bashfulnes, and Musidorus to anger; both Philanax was descending unto them, and
that Musidorus was beginning to say something in Pyrocles behalf. Behold
Kalander, that with arms cast abroad, and open mouth came crying to
Euarchus, holding a stranger in his hand that cried much more then he, desiring
they might be heard speak before the prisoners were removed. Simpathus aided
them in it, and taking such as he could command, stopped Philanax betwixt
entreatie and force, from carrying away the Princes, until it were heard what
new matters these men did bring. So again mounting to the Tribunal, they
hearkened to the strangers vehement speech, or rather appassionate exclayming.
It was in deed Kalodulus, the faithful servant of Musidorus, to whom his
master, when in despite of his best grounded Menalcas to be arrested: by the
help of whose raiment in the mean time he advanced himself to that estate,
which he accounted most high, because it might be serviceable to that fancy,
which he had placed most high in his mind. For Menalcas having faithfully
performed his errand, was as faithfully imprisoned by Kalodulus. Kalodulus
performed the first part of his duty in doing the commandment of his
Prince: so was he with abundance of sincere loyalty extremely perplexed, when
he understood of Menalcas the strange disguising of his beloved Master. For
as the acts he and his Cosen Pyrocles had done in Asia, had filled all the
ears of the Thessalians and Macedonians with no less joy then admiration:
Menalcas he perceived where he was, gessing the like of Pyrocles, comparing
the vnusednes of this act with the vnripenesse of their age, seeing in general
conjecture they could do it for nothing, Euarchus: that both his authority
might prevent any damage to them, and under his wings he himself might
remain safe. But considering a journey to Byzantium Euarchus lay) would
require more time, then he was willing to remain doubtful of his Princes
estate, he resolved at length to write the matter to Euarchus, and himself the
while to go into Arcadia: uncertain what to do when he came thither, but
determined to do his best service to his dear Master, if by any good fortune
he might find him. And so it happened that Mantinea, and as warely and
attentively as he could giving ear to al reports, in hope to hear some thing
of them he sought, he straight received a strange rumor of these things: but
so uncertainly as popular reports carry so rare accidents. But this by all men
he was willed, to seek out Kalander a great Gentleman of that Country, who
would soonest satisfy him of all these occurrents. Euarchus judgment to the
desert. Where seeing great multitudes, and hearing unknown names of Palladius,
and Daiphantus, and not able to press to the place where Euarchus sat, he
enquired for Kalander, and was soon brought unto him: partly because he was
generallye known unto all men, and partly because he had withdrawn himself
from the Euarchus words whether they tended, being not able to endure his
guests condemnation. He enquired forthwith of Kalander the cause of the
assembly: and whither the fame were true of Euarchus presence: who with many
tears, made a doleful recital unto him, both of the Amazon and shepherd,
setting forth their natural graces, and lamenting their pitiful undoing.
Kalodulus immediately know the shepherd was his Duke, and so judging the
other to be Pyrocles, and speedely communicating it to Kalander, who he saw did
favor their case, they brake the press with astonishing every man with their
cries. And being come to Euarchus, Kalodulus fell at his feet telling him
those he had judged were his own Sun and Nephewe; the one the comfort of
Macedon, the other the only stay of Thessalia. With many such like words, but
as from a man that assured himself in that matter he should need small
speech. While Kalander made it known to all men, what the prisoners were
Philanax own reuengefull heart was mollified, when he saw from diverse parts
of the world so near kinsemen should meet in such a necessity. And with all
the fame of Pyrocles and Musidorus, greatly drew him to a Euarchus staide a
good while upon himself, like a valliant man that should receive a notable
encounter, being vehemently stricken with the fatherly love of so excellent
children, and studying with his best reason, what his office required. At
length with such a kind of gravity, as was near to sorrow, he thus vttred his
mind. Arcadians, that what this day I have said, has be^e out of my assured
persuasion, what justice it self and your just laws require. Though
strangers then to me, I had no desire to hurt them, but leaving a side all
considerations of the persons, I wayed the matter which you committed into my
hands, with most impartial and farthest reach of reason. And Lynces eyes in
another? Or rather shall all private respects give place to that holy name?
Be it so, be it so, let my graye hears be laid in the dust with sorrow,
let Pyrocles and Musidorus I prefer

Therefore if there be any thing left in you, of Princely virtue, show it in
constant suffering, that your unprincely dealing has purchased unto you. For
my part I must tell you, you have forced a father to rob himself of his
children. Do you therefore, O Philanax, and you my other Lords of this
country, see the judgment be rightly performed in time, place and manner, as
before appointed. With Kalodulus and Kerxenus to roating lamentations, but all the assembly dolefully to record that pitiful spectacle. Philanax himself
could not abstain from great shows of pitying sorrow, and manifest
withdrawing from performing the kings commandment. But Musidorus having the
hope of his safety, and recovering of the princess Pamela: which Pyrocles, for
whom he was ever resolved his last should be, and stirred up with rage of
unkindness, he thus spoke. Enjoy thy bloody conquest tyrannical Euarchus,
said he; for neither is convenient the title of a king, to a murderer, nor the
remembrance of kindred, to a destroyer of his kindred. Go home and glory that
it Musidorus. Let thy flattering Orators dedicate Crowns of Laurel unto thee,
that the first of thy race, thou have overthrown a Prince of Thessalia. But
for me I hope the Thessalians are not so degenerate from their ancestors, but
that they will revenge my injury; and their loss upon thee. I hope my death
is no more unjust to me; the^ it shall be bitter to thee, howsoever Pyrocles,
with a manlike eye; if not with a pitiful: Give not occasion to the whole
earth to say, see how Pyrocles who often had called to him, did now fully
interrupt him, desiring him not to do him the wrong to give his father ill
words before him, willing him to consider it was their own fault, and not his
injustice, and withal to remember their resolution of well suffering all
accidents, which this impaciencie did seem to varry from: and then kneeling
down Euarchus. If my daily prayers to the Almighty Gods, had so far
prevailed, as to have granted me the end whereto I have directed my actions; I
should rather have been now a comfort to your mind, then an example of your
justice, rather a preserver of your memory by my life, then a monument of your
judgment by my death. But since it Pyrocles have at any time been pleasant,
let one request of mine which shall not be for mine own life, be graciously
accepted of you. What you owe to justice is performed in my death. A father to
have executed his only son, will leave a sufficient example for a greater
crime then this. My blood will satisfy the highest me in your greatest need,
you take away and in such sort take away that which is more dear to her then
all the world, and is the only comfort, wherewith she nourishes her old age?
O give not such an occasion to the noble. Thessalians, for ever to curse the
match that their Prince did make with the Macedon blood. By my loss there
follows no public loss, for you are to hold the seat, and to provide
Thessalia shall sustain? who sending out (whom otherwise they would no more
have spared then their own eyes) their Prince to you, and you requesting to
have him, by you he should thus dishonourably be extinguished. Set before you,
I beseech you, the face of that miserable people, Euarchus has killed
Pyrocles. But the time of my ever farewell approaches, if you do think my
death sufficient for my fault, and do not desire to make Musidorus live, and
Pirocles shall live in him, and you shall not want a child. A child cried out
Musidorus, to him, that killes Pyrocles? with that again he fell to entreat
for Pyrocles, and Pyrocles as fast for Musidorus, each employing his wit how to
show himself most worthy to die, to Euarchus (as often extraordinary
excellencies, not being rightly conceived, do rather offend then please) an
obstinate hearted man, and such a one, who being pitiless, his dominion must
needs be insupportable. But Euarchus that felt his own misery more then
they, and yet loved goodness more Cato killed himself withal, when he had
heard the uttermost of that their speech tended unto: he commanded again they
should be carried away, rising up from the seat (which he would much rather
have wished, should have been his grave) and looking who would take the charge,
whereto every one was exceeding backward. But as this pitiful Philanax and
Kerxenus, whose eyes, honest love (though to diverse parties) held most
attentive, leapt to the table, and putting of the velvet cover, might plainly
discern, with as much wonder as gladness, that the Duke lived. For so it was,
that the drink he had received, was neither as Gynecia first imagined, a love
potion, nor as it was after thought, a deadly poison, but a drink cause of the
making of this drink had first been, that a Princess of Cyprus, graundmother
to Gynecia, being notably learned, (and yet not able with all her learning, to
answer the objections of Cupid) did furiously love a young noble man of her
fathers Court. Who fearing the kings rage, and not once daring either to
attempt Cyprus, was given by her to Gynecia at the time of her marriage, and
the drink finding an old body of Basilius, had kept him some hours longer in
the trance, then it would have done a yoonger. But a good while it was, before
good Basilius could come again to himself: in which time Euarchus more glad
then of the whole worlds Monarchy, to be rid of his miserable Cleofila was
other then a woman. At length remembering the Oracle, which now indeed was
accomplished Gynecia: who poor Lady thought she was leading forth to her
living burial: and (when she came) to recount before all the people, the
excellent virtue was in her, which she Pyrocles and Philoclea who never
bewraied her) that she was the perfect mirror of all wifely love. Which though
in that point undeserved, she did in the remnant of her life daily purchase,
with observing al duty and faith to the example and glory of Greece. So
uncertain are mortal judgments, the same person most infamous, and most
famous, and neither justly. Then Euarchus, and many kind words to Pyrocles,
whom still he dearly loved though in a more virtuous kind, the marriage was
concluded, to the inestimable joy of Euarchus, (toward whom now Musidorus
acknowledged his fault) betwixt these peerless Princes and Princesses.
Philanax for his singular faith ever held dear of Basilius while he lived, and
no less of Musidorus, who was to inherit that Dukedom, and therein confirmed
to him and his, the second place of that Province, with great increase of his
living to maintain it: which like proportion he used to Kaledulus in Thessalia:
Highly honoring Kalander while Clitophon. But as for Sympathus, Pyrocles, (to
whom his father in his own time gave the whole kingdom of Thrace) held him
always about him, giving him in pure gift, the great City of Abdera: But the
solemnities of these marriages, with the Arcadian pastoralles, full of many
comicall adventures, happening to Artaxia and Plexirtus, Erona and Plangus;
Helene and Amphialus, with the wonderful chances that befell them: The
shepheardish loves of Menalcas with Kalodulus daughter; the poor hopes of the
poor Philisides in the pursuit of his affections; the strange continuance of
Klaius and Strephons desire; Lastly the son of Pyrocles named Pyrophilus, and
Melidora, the Pamela by Musidorus, who even at their birth entered into
admirable fortunes; may awake some other spirit to exercise his pen in that,
wherewith mine is already dulled.
