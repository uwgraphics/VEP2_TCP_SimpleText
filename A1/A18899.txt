AFter my very hearty Commendations, Since it has pleased his Majesty out of
his gracious and Royal care of the good of his Kingdom and Subjects, by his
Letters Patents to recommend by way of Collection, the^epaire of the ancient
Haven of the Coast towns of Dunwich, Southwold, and Walberswick in the County
of Suffolk, to the charitable benevolence of all his loving Subjects within
this his Majesty's Realm of England, and Principality of Wales: I thought it
meet (being petitioned by the partie^ name in the said Letters Patents) to give
this addition of assistance thereunto, though there be expressed in the
Briefes (which he will deliver you) sufficient Motives to induce every man to
bestow what is fitting, for the advancement of so worthy an action. Wishing
and desiring you not only to extend your own charitable contribution
thereunto, but also to move and exhort all those within your several Cities,
Towns, Ports, Villages, and Parishes, to contribute cheerfully and liberally
toward the effecting of a work so profitable to the Common wealth, and of so
great a consequence for the safety and defense of the Coast. And so commending
this same to your best care and discreet carriage, I bid you farewell. From my
house in Phillip-lane, London, this 19. day of June, 1619.

Your very loving Friend, E. ZOVCH.
To all Mayors, Iurates, Constables, Bayliffes, Ministers, Churchwardens, and
to all other his Majesty's Officers within the Liberty of the Cinque Ports, as
it shall appertain.
