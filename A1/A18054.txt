A MILITARY Dialogue between PHILOMVSVS and MILES.

Lively expressing the horrible Effects of War and the unspeakable benefit of
Peace.

Dulce bellum in expertis. By Richard Carter.

LONDON, Printed by John Oaks, and are to be sold at the white Lion in St.
Paul's Churchyard, MDCXL.

To the Reader health and happiness.
REader, retire thy self a while,
Where private thou may be
And read (although in rustic style)
This Poem pend by me.
For Pan, and Coridon, gives light,
Like Phoebus now and then;
So truth shall spring and shine full bright,
From my illiterate pen,
Truth seeks no Trumpet for to sound,
She wants no pray so of man:
Good Wine we know, it may be found,
Without a gay Garland.
Briefly therefore, I shall declare,
The scope which I intend,
To show the genuine fruits of war,
And Peace with Truth commend.
The Soldier he would fight the field,
Fond Fame for to increase,
Philomusus does cause him yield:
They both conclude in Peace.
Now least this Preface should exceed
(The Books) and be too great:
No further here, I will proceed,
And now I shut the gate.
Philomusus thus begins. WHat sudden wind has blown you back,
How comes this quick return?
Where are the spoils of war and wrack:
What ailes thee thus to mourn?
It liked thee not to bide at home,
And work from day to day,
But needs (forsooth) you must be gone, Philo gives Miles a harsh entertainment

A Soldiers part to play.
Why look thou thin? why shougst thou so?
Why art thou thus arraid?
Do Soldiers in this habit go?
And with such wages paid?
Thou wents from hence in good attire,
And money in thy bag,
But back again thou do retire:
Not with one comely rag.
Now for my part, I love not jarres:
God send me health and peace,
I take no pleasure in the wars,
My fortunes to increase.
I hope your hotnesse at the first,
To follow Soldiers train,
Is cooled now you have no lust:
In war to gad again.

Miles thus replyeth. I Must confess, I do repent
Before the time I thought:
And that I have by this attempt,
More loss then booty caught.
Yet blame I not the Wars therefore, Miles confesses his ill suc cesse in
the Field. But still gives to war the due praise thereof.

For War is such a gain:
Some that were poor return with store,
Some rich, come home with shame.
As for my loss was small I say,
For (when I went from hence)
I hardly had where with to pay
My charges and expense.
And thus I warred in this case, Nervus belli pecuni^.

In joy for hope of pay:
But Coin was scarce, and Wars did cease:
So home I took my way.
But as for you and all such like,
You flow in wealth at will:
I wonder not that you dislike,
The bloody Wars so ill.
Your money cannot fight for you,
Can wealth defend the Land?
But such as I, and all my crew:
Must in your quarrels stand.
You do of Soldiers base esteem,
For we are abjects now:
The time will come, it may be seen:
To Soldiers you may bow.

Philomusus respond. WEll now I see you like it well,
Still idle to remain:
The more thou stir, the worse you smell,
The Proverb speaks plain.
An honest man some course will take,
To live upon some Trade; Philo proceeds in reproving vagrant Soldiers.

And as we do our bargain make;
So is our wages paid.
If harm thou catch, whose is the blame?
Not his that did thee hire:
For as thou do thy wages claim,
So men thy work require.
Thou must not think to loyter then,
Most like the idle Drones:
Consuming that which other men,
Have got with painful groans.
These happy times were in my mind,
When all were well employed;
When hardly one we could not find,
That idle did abide.
But idle persons now do shift,
Great multitudes do swarm;
Committing murder, whoredom, theft:
And every mortal harm.
One says, he gladly would take pains,
Yet work he will not seek:
If he one day in work remains,
Will play therefore a week.
Some wrap their legs with clouts and salve,
In corners where they lurk:
But Soldiers chiefly think they have,
A privilege from work.
Thus vagrant Soldiers go and come,
Until good Laws take place:
Then some reform, and other some
Do die with great disgrace.
And Soldiers do with ill intent;
Set all at five, and nine:
And when your means you have all spent,
All others you repine.
If Soldiers can in war I say,
All mortal pains embrace,
I nothing doubt but they that may,
As Well take pains in peace.
For he that can do nothing more
But Peascods sheale (they say)
Three quarters of a year therefore,
For want of work must play.

Miles. WE Soldiers stand in all the strife,
For to defend the Land:
With Pikes and Gunnes, and loss of life,
Your foes we do withstand.
When we have passed all this harm,
With great distress and cost,
Some one a Leg, and some an Arm,
And other joints have lost.
Yet nothing to us will you give,
But poor Nay and delay:
Our wants you will not once relieve,
But we must pack away.
Sometimes a sore or festered wound,
Lame soldiers may protect:
But such as I (whose limbs be sound)
We live still in suspect.
For vagrant persons now we go,
And scorned here, and there:
So that in war, with mortal foe,
We live not in such fear,
And when a Soldier would take pains,
His service is refused:
But if from labor he refiaines,
He must not be excused.
If beg, or steal, the Law takes place,
Which way then shall we live?
If steal, (we do dye with disgrace)
The Law will not forgive.
I think it better to embrace
The War (and purchase Fame)
Than thus to live in time of peace,
In such reproach and shame.
I can with Musket travise so, Ho^ well played boasting Thrasoe.

And toss the tottering Pikes:
I know to skirmish with my foe,
And when I ought to strike.
I know to spur the Barbed Horse,
And how to make my Race,
And warily my foes to course,
And valiently them chase.
I can well scale those fenced Walls,
Against which I am sent
I want no skill, when time thus falls,
Ambushments to prevent.
I know to keep me in array,
To march and to retire:
And take advantage on the day,
When need shall so require.
I skillful am how every wing,
In order should be placed,
For warlike Feasts, in every thing,
I will not be out-fac'd.
These things are hard for Carpet Knights,
Who sleep in ease and rest:
But Soldiers gain (though got in fights)
In time of War is best.

Philomusus. OH boasting Thrasoe, I thee hear,
How feign thou would excuse
Thy loytering life; but stay, forbear,
Thou do thy self abuse,
What man so mad, or void of care,
Or of so little wit,
That does not think the wars now are
In time of peace, unfit.
War does disturb, and vex each thing,
And order does deface;
And does dis-throne a right borne King
Out of his Regal place.
War sets in the selfsame Throne,
Usurpers for to reign:
The Lords and Peers then grieve and groan,
When Commons all are slain.
The Virgins ravished most vild,
The newborn Infants dye:
The Father sees his murdered child,
As he does wounded lie.
The Wife lamenting, weeping goes,
Anon alike does speed:
And still the murdering soldier does,
In shedding blood proceed.
Then fiery flames consumes the Town,
When murdering Cannons rore:
The Barbed Horses trample down
The fruits of all our store.
And noble sparks, in place most high
Are then a Soldiers prey,
Some plead for life, some desperately
Do cast themselves away.
Who speedeth best has for his hire
The loss of wealth and life:
Most stately buildings flame with fire,
Whilst swords do end the strife.
The tattering Terrets shake with shot,
The battered Bulwarks break:
Hall, Church, nor Temple, stands not;
Our strength is then too weak.
Thus raging rigor, rules the roast,
Rash ruin riddeth all:
Yet thou of war do brag and boast,
As if our loss were small.
To this intent, example take,
Of Soldiers lewdness great:
That I may prove these words I speak,
I briefly shall repeat.
A Tragedy of Soldiers art,
Most worthy of all blame:
Both for the terror of the fact,
And authors of the same.
The Country, place, and parties name,
I nominate will not:
Because that Christians did the same,
But Christ they clean forgot.

A sad tragical Relation. A Captain had (I say again)
Obtained at Prince his hand,
For to conduct a Band of men,
Into an other Land.
And marching on approached near,
Unto a Peasants Farm:
(For so they term the Yeomen there,)
This yeoman thought no harm.
But (as he durst not contrary,
So did he entertain:
The Captain with all courtesy,
The Soldiers did remain.
Within a Village joining near:
The Captain only be,
With other Soldiers he had there,
As after you shall see.
Who lodged at this Yeomans house,
Who feasted them with store:
That he might still prevent abuse,
Was careful evermore.
This Host three comely Daughters had,
The eldest was most fair:
Which made the Captain almost mad:
His lust was set on fire.
Her forehead high, did register,
Her feature men adored:
There was not one, like unto her,
Like Venus so adorned.
Her Crimson cheeks; and Christ all eyes,
Her lips, like Cherries red:
Her words right fober, grave, and wise;
Her hair like golden thread.
Venus with her could not compare, Queen Dido.

Which won the golden Ball:
Nor Dido, that sweet Lady fair,
Who had the love of all.
Her voice did sing melodiously,
To such as did her hear,
That all which heard her harmony,
Their drooping hearts did cheer.
Much further yet I could proceed,
Nature did thus adorn:
You may in her love-lines still read;
She did all baseness scorn.
If outward parts like stars did shine,
Which men did plainly see:
Doubtless her soul was most divine,
(I judge in charity.)
The Captains Lust this did renew, The estate of those places that are vexed
with War.

With furious fiery (...):
He bidding honesty adieu,
Then snatched her in his arms.
This lustful Captain would not stay,
This Virgin to entreat:
But hayling her, by force away,
I blush this to repeat.
The Devil on this Leatcher eggs,
He throws her on a bed:
Some (of his Soldiers held her legs,
Her arms, and some her head.
Whilst he committed viilany,
To feed his lustful will;
In vain she screeks, lament and cry,
None could prevent her ill.
This being done, he jeeres her too,
I will omit to show,
What bloody tears, and throbs also:
Did from this Ravished flow.
Then did she seek to revenge it,
And thereto was she bent,
Behold also: how time did hit,
To further her intent.
She snatching up a Knife which he,
(Had lefe upon the board)
Then suddenly to him stepped she:
And to the heart him goard.
Stone dead he sinketh down that day,
The rest were in a Maze:
But she did start aside whilst they;
Upon the corpse did gaze.
She told her father what was done,
And forth with fled away:
Alas she knew not where to run,
But to the Lord did pray.
Desiring rather death, then life:
And then report was brought,
Unto the Soldiers of that strife,
And who that fact had wrought.
The Soulpiers run as they were wild,
Until they had her found:
She being caught, these Tyrants vilde,
Fast to a Tree her bound.
The Soldiers then discharged there,
At her their thund ring shot:
So that their bullets left in her,
Not one free place or spot.
Thus did this peerlesse Paragon,
For whose death we may grieve:
The like to her I know not one:
That do amongst us live.
I must bewail the female sex,
And wish they may amend:
But yet the Captain did her vex,
And first the Law offend.
In this unhappy Tragedy,
There many more were slain:
The Yeomans house they did destroy,
Who did them entertain.
This is your warlike havoc still,
This is the Soldiers trade:
Who having got the reyns at will,
Run mad like Colts unmade.
Consuming all; and laying waste,
Always both night and day:
And rushing headlong at the last,
Into their own decay.

Miles Respond. ANd what of this? though some do ill,
Will you condemn the rest?
As if men's blood, only to spill,
A Soldier thus were pressed,
Nay, (by a Soldiers troth I swear)
Our Discipline is such:
That now in peace, amongst you here,
You use not half so much.

Philomusus. ALL Soldiers not condemned are, Vbi non est bellum, ibi pax
perversa.

But some we must commend;
Who prudently (by lawful War)
The Commonweal defend.
But better were it, without doubt,
(If God so pleased would be)
That there peace the World throughout,
Withal of each degree.

Miles. I Do confess it may be said,
That (peace with truth is sweet)
But circumstances duly wai'd,
War sometimes is as meet.
You speak disdainful of War now,
I say to you again,
In time of peace more mischief flow,
Then do in War remain.
First know, that peace does plenty cause,
From plenty still proceeds;
The hurtful breach of all good Laws;
Prosperities now breeds.
As Whoredom, Pride, and Lechery,
In time of peace are rife:
Contempt of God and man always,
With gluttony and strife.
If Soldiers in the War do spoil,
The Miser for his gold:
In peace the Rich, the poor do foil,
Much more a thousand fold.
In War by sword, sometimes we die,
And then is peace begun:
But poor men are by Usury,
In time of peace undone.
In War the Victor shows mercy,
Unto his yielding foe;
In peace the debtor loud does cry,
Yet to Jail must go.
In War hard lodging, mean attire,
And homely Joans men use:
In peace all these with fond desire,
Most proudly fools abuse.
In War the presence of our foes,
A view of death does give:
In peace your folly you disclose,
And dream you shall still live.
In time of peace true Justice sure,
With most can bear no sway;
Yet such great fear War does procure:
It chaseth vice away.
If that the cause of War be good,
The end then proves so:
If not; our sins, they have withstood,
Vice is our greatest foe.

Philomusus. ALas, poor silly simple man,
What, are thy wits thine own?
Thou speak much, but little can,
To good effect be shown.
And sure I am of this always,
It Is hard for one to take:
From peace, her due deserved praise,
Or good of ill to make.
Thou say peace breeds plentiousnesse
That freely I confess:
But (saying store breeds idleness)
Therein thou do digress.
Wine is not drunken of it self,
Though Drunkards it abuse:
Nor idleness proceeds from pelf,
Though some it leudly use.
Now Judge thyself whether that man,
In idleness does rest,
When he does labor what he can:
Of store to be possessed.
Or he that has not wherewithal,
His empty maw to feed;
With tooth and nail, and hand does hall,
For to supply his need.
We live in peace, with what we got,
You live in War, and want;
It does appear, we loyter not:
But you in work are scant.
If you more idle did not live,
In war then we in peace: Plenty breeds not idleness, but the abuse thereof.

You freely would to others give,
And not their goods decrease.
You say there are of vices swarms,
In peace and plenty now;
But I conceal a thousand harms,
From bloody wars that flow.
I rather plough, and sow in field,
With sweat to get my bread:
Then in the Wars with golden shield,
A Troop of Horses lead.
O noble, Athens, had thou used,
Dame Pallas gift aright:
Thy walls had then not been abused,
But still had stood in sight.
Before the walls were raized above,
And ere the Town had name;
Or God Neptune with Pallas strove:
For honor of the same.
Their strife was this: first Neptune smote, Neptunus est Deus Maris, vel Mare
ipsum.

A Rock with Trident Mace:
From whence a warlike Horse did trot,
Well harnessed in that place.
Then Pallas smote the ground most free,
With Javelin she did bear:
From whence afresh, green Olive Tree,
Did presently appear.
The warlike Horse did represent,
In war most good success:
The Olive Tree: did with consent,
To Athens peace express.
Then wisely Athens took their course,
In one they did agree:
Forsaking Neptunes armed Horse,
They choosed Pallas Tree.
If they foreseeing victory,
Did rather seek for peace,
How much more then ought we then they,
From doubtful wars to cease?
Now Soldiers leave Tou-to-lo-gie,
If men in peace do wrong:
Good Laws have now free liberty;
To punish them ere long.

Miles. But by your leave I am not mad:
My wits are not yet flowne:
I do not make a good thing bad:
Nor speak of things unknown.
Epe-mi nun-das does report,
That under Cloak of peace,
(Vice vaunteth out, with pomp and port)
But virtue does increase.
Sodom and Gomor, in the plain,
With diverse Cities more;
There did not one of them remain
(But only little Zoar.)
These lived in peace, and fond desire, Geu. 19.

Fearing no war at all:
Till from the Lord Brimstone and fire,
Did down upon them fall.
When did Darius Kingdoms jarre,
Who Asia all possessed?
But when he was unarmed for war,
And gave himself to rest.
You trim your selves in Peacocks plumes, Security and sloth are forerunners of
destruction.

Sporting in Venus Court:
You are besmeared with sweet perfumes,
And use each want on sport.
A Helmet hides your handsome face,
Oh take heed of a Gunne.
Your Mistress you cannot embrace,
If Mars his course you run.
You are fool bent, with fond intent,
To dance in Venus string:
To all delights you are attent,
All care away you sing.
What did you never hear this truth,
What stories do report:
Of Hercules; how in his youth
There did to him resort,
Two Ladies, one a dainty dame,
In stately Robes beclad,
The other plain of Natures frame,
These found the yongster fad.
To Hercules these females came,
But one with wanton tricks,
The other unto fight for fame.
His youthful courage pricks.
But Hercules he did detest,
The first; and all she said:
Unto the second Ladies heast,
He during life obeyed.
By Hercules his choice and fate,
We easily may guess;
That peace makes men effeminate,
Which War will soon suppress.

Philomusus. NOw Tully does prefer ill peace,
Before a most just War:
Therefore when Foxes teach the Geese
Great danger is not far.
For Pius Anthonius said,
I better like of peace;
Then other Kingdoms to invade:
My glory to increase.
And Andrianus also said;
He rather would divide,
Small bounds in peace, then make aside,
To conquer Kingdoms wide.
For War that changes peace (I say)
Is like a harebrain Colt:
That leaves the plain and beaten way,
Ore Hedge and Ditch to bolt.
Not peace, but the abuse of peace, The abuse; takes not away the use.

Gods anger does provoke,
When Sodom did her sin increase,
Gods wrath on them did smoke.
I say not but that wisdom would,
In peace we should prepare:
Against our foes, always we should,
Still have a watchful care.
I wish our ships may multiply,
And in our Havens ride,
And that we may both far and nigh,
Artillery provide.
I wish our youth with Marshall strain,
May train in every place:
By means hereof we may attain,
Great skill in little space.

Miles. INdeed your words I understand,
But oh how brave a thing,
It is when fame in every Land,
Our valiant Prowess ring.
But hear me now, I tell you what,
To this you needs must yield;
No fame can be compared with that,
That is obtained in field.
Thus fame does frump them to their face,
Who do all War deride;
Such do condemme the Eagles grace,
And praise the Peacocks price.

Philomusus. THou seem to have a valiant heart,
Thou countst of blood but light:
Consider thou a Christian art,
And they that with thee fight
Are Christians too as well as we.
What should there be more said?
In Truth, and Peace, we must agree:
As members of one head.
The Heathen they were still at odds,
God was to them unknown;
And every man, adored his gods,
Or Idols of his own.
But Christians have one God most good:
That God we worship all.
Know thou, that shedding Christians blood,
Is not a trespass small.
Lucre of gain did move their hands,
To War, and bloody Rage:
For quarrels small on foreign Lands,
Ungodly Wars do wage.
As they their Triumphs did erect,
So envy did abound;
And they (whom least they did suspect:
Did first their pride confound.)
Where is the Parsian Macedon?
And Roman Empire wide?
And Thesius, that valiant one?
And Hercules beside?
Alexander, with thousands more,
Which I omit to name;
Did hazard life, and all their store,
To follow fleeting fame.
What can you say, now of these men,
That shed of blood such store?
For, take away the cause, and then;
Their fame remayns no more.
Yet such as you (as Tully says)
That nothing have to lose: He that has nothing of his own, would have all
things common.

Are forward still in brawles and frayes,
For then your profit grows.
In troubled waters you may fish;
Not waying others wracks
For blood and War, you ever wish,
To satisfy your lack.
And now (my friend) since that our King,
And Country rest in peace,
Forbear to strike this jarring string,
From blood and brawls now cease.
But when by Law thou shall be pressed,
Obey the King always,
Then thou shall have my wishes best:
That thou may win the day.

Miles. YOur words with me do now prevail,
And this I add beside,
In vain the shipman hoysts his Sail:
Against both Wind and Tide.
And now I see you partly yield,
To Mars his honor right:
True fame obtained is in field;
When Soldiers bravely fight.

Philomusus. I Say (indeed) that Fame always,
In lawful War is good:
And worthy praise (if otherwise,
It may not be withstood.)
But all those Kings I more praise yet,
That rule in peace aright:
Then such as have a pregnant wit,
Against their foes to fight.
To this Cicero is not wrong,
Who says let weapons yield
To men in Gowns that use the tongue, Romulus primus rex Romanorum. Numa
Pomphilius vir Sabinus Romanorum rex, secundus a Romulo.

Resign the conquered field.
Though Romulus fought valiantly,
As Rome can witness well:
Yet Numa (ruling quietly)
Did Romulus excel.
But lo, what need I rove to Rome?
To fetch examples far
Great peace we do enjoy at home;
And are not vexed with War.
(Lord) bless King Charles with peace and health
And still preserve his Grace:
With Nestors age, and Craesus wealth
To rule in Regal place,
Give to thy Gospel passage free,
To flourish every where,
Make Christians all in Faith agree:
In Europe far, and near.
The fertile earth by tillage all,
Re-yields in time her store:
Each fruitful thing of moment small.
Does prosper daily more.
We nothing want (if Grace we have)
To be in heart content;
With thankfulness for to receive,
Those gifts which God has sent.
Religion here is grounded pure,
Like England, now no Coast
Throughout the bounds of Europe sure,
Hereof, like us may boast.
For Discipline like ancient Rome;
For wise, brave men of might:
A Thebes for wealth: we are become,
Corinth and Athens right.
Our King does prize his people high,
Their goods, and lives, always:
And all true subjects willingly,
His Highness do obey.
Both Prince and Peers, with noble train
With solid Council sage,
Do seem, for to renew again;
The former golden Age.
Foul crimes, we see, now punished be,
And good men have reward:
Now Justice has to each degree,
Of Judgment true regard.
O happy Realm, King Charles happy,
O happy subjects all:
O that we knew, how happily:
Our happiness does fall.
Then should we highly prize the Reign,
Of our Renowned King:
With melody and mirth amayne,
Our Muses thus would sing.
Our King with Kingly Majesty, Sol(...)

And other virtues rare;
(Wherein to Solomon full high;
His Grace we may compare.)
You that with Envy do corrode,
Like grisly Gorgons fell:
With tumors great like Aesops Toade, Gorgonius: So Rammish and Goat-like do
all Heretics, and Schimaticks smell.

In poisoned Malice swell.
Will you to Hell your selves engage?
Know God will work his will:
Not spightfull Saul for all his rage,
Could good King David kill.
Your spite is spide, your knots are known,
Your secrets are bewrayde:
And God upon your plots has blown,
Your selves you have betraide.
The like success God grant to those,
That wish King Charles ill:
(O God) prevent our mortal foes,
Thy Church oh prosper still.
Thy Tents how goodly garnisht be,
Great Britain greatly graced?
No Nation can compare with thee;
Great privilege thou have.
Had I the learned Homers strain,
Or Virgils stately speech:
If Tullies tongue I could obtain,
Thy praise I should impeach,
Therefore in silence leave I will,
Thy full flourishing fame
To wiser wits, and learned quill;
To publish forth the same.
An Ivy-bush is hung in vain.
Where good Wine is to sell:
Here now I shall my self contain,
And still thus pray I will.
(O Lord) with walls of brass(...)e,
Environ Britain round,
When all the World shall her admire,
Praise shall to God rebound.
Thus to my purpose, now I come,
From which I have digrest,
(Brave Soldier) this shall be the sum:
Leave War, and live at rest.
Enjoy those fruits of Peace that fall Philo. has not a long tongue and a
short hand.

I will relieve thy lack:
This money take; and therewithal,
Buy raiment for thy back.
If thou did know, that small increase,
Which other Nations taste,
Then would thou more esteem of peace,
And make to War less haste.
Now whilst this peace we do behold,
Let us ensue the same:
With heart, and voice, still as we should,
Thus praise, and laud Gods Name.
And render to our famous King,
Such firm Allegiance true;
Those fruits the Gospel forth does bring:
From faithful subjects due.

Miles returns thanks to Philomusus. FOr this great love to me you show,
Most hearty thanks I give:
I purpose still to pray for you,
Whilst here on earth I live.
(Good sir) let not my misery,
Offensive be a whit,
Too bold behaved my self have,
My ignorance remit.
Your counsel now I do embrace,
(As reason does require)
And that the Lord would give me grace,
The same I must desire.
I wish good Wars may prostee well,
With triumph and increase,
To subdue all that do rebel:
Against our King of peace.
As God has blessed his peaceful Reign,
Those years, already past,
Oh still let him and his remain:
In peace that aye shall last.
And now in peace, whilst here I live,
I shall be ready pressed:
To peace and Prince, my self will give,
In War to do my best.

Philomusus concludes. I Like thy resolution well;
Thereto I do agree:
Let thou and I together dwell.
We both as one will be.

FINIS.
