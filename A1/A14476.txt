After diverse works made / translated and achieued / having no work in
hand. I sittyng in my study where as lay many diverse paunflettis and
bookys. happened that to my hand came a lytyl book in frenshe. which late was
translated out of latin by some noble clerk of france which book is named
Eneydos / made in latin by that noble poet and great clerk vyrgyle / which
book I saw over and read therein. How after the general destruccyon of the
great Troy, Eneas departed berynge his old fader anchises upon his sholdres /
his lityl son yolus on his hand. his wife with much other people following /
and how he shypped and departed with all thystorye of his adventures that he
had er he came to the achieuement of his conquest of ytalye as all a long shall
be showed in this present book. In which book I had great playsyr. by cause
of the fair and honest terms and words in frenshe / which I never saw to
fore like. ne none so playsaunt ne so well ordered. which book as me seemed
should be much requysyte to noble men to see as well for the eloquence as the
historyes / How well that many honderd yerys passed was the said book of
eneydos with other works made and learned daily in scolis specially in ytalye
and other places / which historye the said vyrgyle made in meter / And when I
had aduysed me in this said book. I delybered and concluded to translate it in
to english And forthwyth took a pen and ynke and wrote a leef or tweyne /
which I ouersawe again to corecte it / And wha^ I saw the fair and strange
terms therein / I doubted that it should not please some gentylmen which late
blamed me saying yt in my translacyons I had over curyous terms which could
not be understand of common people / and desired mete use old and homely terms
in my translacyons. and fayn would I satysfye every man / and so to do took an
old book and read therein / and certainly the english was so rude and brood
that I could not well understand it. And also my lord abbot of westmynster
ded do show to me late certain euydences wryton in old english for to
reduce it in to our english now vsid / And certainly it was wreton in such
wise that it was more like to dutche than english I could not reduce ne
bring it to be vnderstonden / And certainly our langage now used varyeth far
from that. which was used and spoken when I was borne / For we english men /
ben borne under the domynacyon of the moon. which is never steadfast / but
ever wauerynge / wexynge one season / and waneth and dyscreaseth another season
/ And that common english that is spoken in one shyre varyeth from a another.
In so much that in my days happened that certain merchants were in a ship^
in tamyse for to have sailed over the sea into zelande / and for lack of wind
they tarried at forlond. and went to land for to refreshe them And one of
them named sheffelde a mercer came in to an hows and axed for me^e. and
specially he axyd after eggys And the good wife answerde. that she could speak
no frenshe. And the merchant was angry. for he also could speak no frenshe.
but would have had eggs / and she understood him not / And then at last a
another said that he would have eyren / then the good wife said that she
understood him well / Loo what should a man in these days now write. eggs or
eyren / certainly it is hard to playse every man / because of dyuersite and
change of langage. For in these days every man that is in any reputacyon in
his country. will utter his co^mynycacyon and matters in such manners and terms
/ that few men shall understand them / And some honest and great clerks have been with me and desired me to write the most curyous terms that I could find
/ And thus between plain rude / and curyous I stand abashed. but in my
Judgment / the common terms that be dayli used ben lyghter to be understand
than the old and au^cyent english / And for as much as this present book
is not for a rude vplondyssh man to labor therein / ne read it / but only for
a clerk and a noble gentylman that feleth and understands in faytes of arms
in love and in noble chyualrye / Therefore in a mean between both I have
reduced and translated this said book in to our english not over rude ne
curyous but in such terms as shall be understood by goddys grace according
to my copye. And if any man will enter mete in redyng of hit and fyndeth such
terms that he can not understand late him goo read and learn vyrgyll / or the
pystles of ouyde / and there he shall see and understand lightly all / If he
have a good redar and enformer / For this book is not for every rude dna
uncunning man to see / but to clerkys and very gentylmen that understand
gentylnes and science Then I pray all them that shall read in this lytyl
treatys to hold me for excused for the translatynge of hit. For I knowleche my
self ignorant of conning to enpryse on me so hie and noble a work / But I
pray master John Skeleton late created poet laureate in the vnyuersite of
oxenforde to ouersee and correct this said book. And taddresse and expowne
where as shall be found fault to them that shall require it. For him I
know for suffycyent to expowne and english every dyffyculte that is therein /
For he has late translated the epystlys of Tulle / and the book of dyodorus
syculus. and diverse other works out of latin in to english not in rude and
old langage. but in polysshed and ornate terms craftily. as he that has
read vyrgyle / ouyde. tullye. and all the other noble poets and orators / to
me unknown: And also he has read the ix. muses and understand their
musicalle scyences. and to whom of them each science is appropred. I suppose
he has dronken of Ely^ons well. Then I pray him and such other to correct
add or mynysshe where as he or they shall find fault / For I have but
followed my copye in frenshe as nygh as me is possible / And if any word be
said therein well / I am glad. and if otherwise I submytte my said book to their
correctyon / which book I present unto the hye born my tocomynge naturell and
souerayn lord Arthur by the grace of god Prince of Walys Duc of Cornewayll. and
Earl of Chester first bygoten sone and heyer unto our most dradde natural and
souerayn lord and most christian king / Henry the vij. by the grace of god
king of England and of France and lord of Irelonde / byseching his noble
grace to receive it in thank of me his most humble subget and servant / And
I shall pray unto almighty god for his prosperous encreasyng in virtue /
wysedom / and humanyte that he may be egal with the most reno^med of all his
noble progenytours And so to live in this present life / that after this
transitorye life he and we all may come to everlasting life in heaven / Amen:

TO the honor of god almighty / and to the glorious vyrgyne Marye mother of
all grace / and to the vtylyte and prouffyt of all the policye mondayne. this
present book compyled by virgyle right subtyl and Ingenyous orator and poet
/ Intytuled Eneydos. has be translated out of latin in to common langage / In
which may all valiant princes and other nobles see many valorous fayttes of
arms. And also this present book is necessary to all cytezens and habytaunts
in towns and castellis / for they shall see. How sometime troy the grant /
and many other places strong and inexpupnable have been be sieged sharply and
assailed. And also coragyously and valyau^tly defended / and the said book is
at this present time much necessary / for to enstructe small and great. for
euerych in his right / to keep and defend / For a thing more noble is to deye
/ than vylanously to be subdued /
How the right puyssant king pryamus edyfyed the great Cite of Troy Capm^
primu^
FOr to here / opene / and declare the matere of which here after shall be
made mencyon / It behooves to presuppose that Troy the great capytall cite /
and thexcellentest of all the cytees of the country and regyon of Asye was
constructe and edefyed by the right puyssau^t and renomed king Pryamus sone of
laomedon descended of thau^cyen stock of Dardanns by many degrees / which was
sone of Iubyter and of Electra his wife after the fyctious poetyque / And the
first orygynall beginning of the genealogye of kings. And the said Troy was
enuyronued in form of siege / and of excidyon by Agamenon king in greece
brother of menelaus / which was husbonde to helayne The which agamenon
assembled and accompanied with many kings. dukes / earls / and great qua^tyte
of other princes and greeks innumerable. had the magystracyon and universal
governance of all thexcersite and host to fore Troy:

DVryng the said siege / Pryam^ habounded in lygnage of one and other sex so
reno^med of beaulte wisdom and prudo^mye / science. prowess. valyau^ce.
prophecye / and other virtuous proprytees / that all the world could not
enough meruaylle / How god and fortune had emprysed to endowe a mortal man
with dowayres so hye and virtuous / But the prudence of pryame knowing to fore
/ that the aduenements and aduersitees of war be doubtous and under the hand
of fortune / the which after his mutabylite gives vyctorye / To that one
encreacynge honor glory / tryumphe / and gladness / And to that other she
gives to be subgette to the face of the right blody sword in great effusion
of blood and dymunycion of prowess and of their genealogye the mutable
captyuyte of their prosperyte and aduersite or evil fortune:

Pryame then will teshewe and help for things doubtous for to come. to that
end that his royalme shall not depart out of his hand ne fro his blood / If
it so happened that he and his children were overthrown fro his name by force
of sword or of the siege. First he did do depart one of his sons named
polydorus the xiiij sone and first of his name. In hoping that to him / his
name and vengeance if it were need should be kept

Polidorus then^e was sent with a great multitude of noble company full of
yougthe and of strong courage with richesse enough of gold and of silver /
money / tresour and Iewellis / unto a king named plasmator king of tarce /
which enduryng the good fortune. showed him right socourable to the said king
pryame / In offering him self to socoure him if he had need in all points.
in which the said pryame would require him. But the prosperous fortune of the
king pryam turned in to adverse. The said plasmator chau^gyng his will / and
all thamyte. which long time had endured and promised to hold to the said
king Pryame. as ye shall here after

NOw then plasmator received Polidorus so magnyfycatly and with so great
honor that by writing it may not be recyted. ne the thing descryued / And
after when Pryam was subdued. and put under the sharp domynacyon of the
greeks. In somoche that they had slain then^e some of the sons of the said
pryame. and many kings to him alyed / And that into the cite many were
wythdrawen for to give to the said pryam aid and comfort. and the said
trojans miserable seemed better to lose and indyge^t of force. than to have
appearance of vyctoryus glory. And this comen to the knowleche of plasmator.
thought in his mind. and conspyred the death of the said polydorus / And in
fayte the said plasmator brought the said polydorus upon the ryuage of the sea
which was sondy / and a place secret enough fro the syghte of men / in which
place the said plasmator slew polydorus with a darte which he bare The which
so traytoursly slain was by the said plasmator buried in the same place within
the sonde Upon whom was so much sonde laid / that upon polydorus seemed to be
a lityl hille or montycle / And all this was done by the said plasmator. to
the end that his richesse which was brought to him for the governance of ye
said polydorus / should abide with him for to accomplish his auaryce
Insacyable And sith he saw that the force and strength of the troyians was
then so perturbed by the pryckynge of fortune that it seemed to him / that
for the cause of this excessyue occysion / lityl damage and hurt might come to
him:

But then when the noble cite of Asye was broylled and burnt by the subtyl
accyon of the fire put in to it by the greeks. In so great largeness. that
for the thick tenebrosite of the black smoke which the place had enbraced
and issued out The sterres of the heaven had wythholden their clear
illustracyons. And had no faculte ne power by their naturel light to enlumyne
the said place / And that none eye of any person could perceive any thing /
but all only by the domageous clerenesse of the fire devouring the pomp of
Troy Now was that pyetous cite / sometime example in all good virtues above
all other cytees of the world all brent and put in desolacyon suffretous /
Abydyng only one of the yates of the same town. named in their langage the
yate stex which was made so maysterly / that the Ingenyous subtylte of
maistres of masonrye carpentrye / that of all ye cou^treyr of Asie it passed
all other in efforte and strength It was made of so hye and excellent
ouurage:

How the cite was cruelly set a fire. and on a flamm And how Eneas: armed
bare his fader out of the same cite capitulo. ijo.
BY the same yate stex then set in fire and flamme. And smokynge the total
desolacyon of the said plase of Troy. like as the gods and fortune had
enterprysed to destroy so artyfycyall a work unto the last stone and
foundemente of so hye a place / And by horrible and cruel indygnacyon to
throw down / destroy. and confound the pompouse and proud noblenes of
thynhabytants of Troy / and also their possessions and hauoyr cyuyles and
other / And under the tenebres and derkenes departed Eneas armed clerly at all
pieces in the facyon of a cote armor upon his harnoys / The despoyle of a
right horrible and much cruel lion. Which the said Eneas had killed and
slain. And the said eneas bare upon his sholdres his fader Anchises / the
which then by old age and living many years his blood was weyen cold so
much that he might not walk ne help him self by moeuynge / And thus
Anchises trussed upon the sholdres of his sone eneas held a coffre well
rychely adourned with many precious stones in facyon and manner of a shryne In
the which were the gods of Troy and great and diuerce relykes / which were
the things / In which the famylye of Troy / the people. and comynalte of
Asie had fried their socoures / and thalegement of their anguysshous
heuynesses And Eneas thus charged with his fader whom he bare with magnanymyte
of courage as said is / brought his sone yolus by the right hand / being of
the age of xij year so fair and so well composed that it may leefully be
said that nature had done her deuoyr and helped to the procreacyon of such a
figure for a patron of mankind What shall I say more of Anchises and yolus
like as said is / ensiewed creusa his wife vncuryously aourned / Nothing
appertenau^t to thestate royal / her vysage mate by frequente sources of great
teeris / And her heyr which by manuel artyfyces had dyligently be enryched
let them hanging indyfferently and all rufflyd on all parties. Without any
hope of amendment / It should be an hard thing to many one to put in
forgetynge her sweet first life and now her deploracyon / It is a grievous thing
to me to pass over so lightly the lamentable circumstau^ces of her sorrowful
heuynesses in so few wordis / Now here after we shall say consequently that
/ that comynalte. and confusion of people all bywepte / noble / unnoble
people. men wymmen and children fleeynge ensiwed Eneas so berynge his fader as
said is It were a thing inhumayne to behold them without pity / but yet
more pyetous to tell it like as it was done in deed / This company unhappy
issued out of a right good and habundau^ce place of all things concupyssible
to thappetyte of their desire / And so much incertayne after this dolourous
excyle. in what regyon might happen the end of their maleurouse and unhappy
destynees.

THis noble company trojan sometime in rest / and now vacabonde and fugytyf by
the feeldes dardanike came and aryued in a port of the sea named simoyiz / and
there right pencyf entered into the sea. and by troblous reuolucyons of the
vn^des or wawes were brought into the I Will of Anchandron and passed thorugh the
foreste of yde. which is in the said country of troy / And here we shall
finysshe to speak of the sorrowful and tedyous fleing of the pour meschau^te
and miserable trojans / which hyder to had followed Eneas / Eneas by force of
oores. and of the wawes of the sea / arrived in the royalme and country of
Trace / like as the power of wind after the dysposicyon of his destenye In to
the said place had brought him. In the which place of Trace. Polydorus
had be vylaynously slain by Plasmator king of the same Regyon of Trace In
this country of Trace. Eneas which had great tresours of the richesse of
Troy / began to edyfye a cite named Eneade. taking it of his name.
Nevertheless by cause that Eneas saw the cite by him bygonne come not by the
dyligence and operacyon of the werkemen to his perfeccyon / And that the said
operacyon and dyffycyle work might not in so short space of time to come to
such auaunsemente and perfectyon / without the dyligence. favor / and good
will of his goddys / the which thaugh they had been horrible and cruel and
without pity to the trojans to fore the confusion and utter dystructyon of
their noble and honorable cite / Nevertheless in this caas partyculer they
shewde them self favorable enough / And entendynge to give comfort aid and
counseyl to thendeme^tes and engynes of the werkmen which the cite Eneyde
bylded and edifyed. And therefore would and dysposed Eneas to halowe a day
prefyxed in making sacrifyces to his goddis / after the solempnyte in such a
caas by the trojans accustumed. And he him self as prince and example of his
people slew a white bulle as crystal to fore the face of his goddys / And of
the blood that issued of the same with heart devout bysprange right humbly
and by great love and ardour of dylection the hostel upon the which the goddis
were set:

How Eneas sacryfied to his goddis in the place where Polydorus had be slain:
Capitulo. iijo.
NOw perauenture it happened that Eneas made the celebracyon of the sacrifyce
to fore said in the self place / where as Polydorus had be slain and buried
in the sonde / by the sea side: By the inhumanyte and wickedness of Plasmator
/ In which place there had be accumyled or heped of sonde a lytyl hylle or
mountycle / upon which by the space of time / about eyghte or ix. year were
issued out of the earth small busshes or lityll trees by humydite and hete
depely enroted in the earth. and upon the lytyl hylle grown on heyghte. the
which trees were named in frenshe murtyllers cornyllers. And on the side of
the hille was an hye plotte so nyghe that it shadowed by great space the place.
where as was made the said sacryfyce: Thoo trees apperceyued by Eneas came
thider in entencyon to cut and hew down some of the bows and branches for
to apparaylle / and make fair the place of his sacrefyce / Like as we english
men do when we halowe any solempnyte in the time of somer / In strowynge with
herbs and setting up of grene trees and bows in the chirches and chappellis
for to refresshe the people there assembled. by cause of the fest and
solempnyte there to be hallowed

How Eneas in making the foresaid sacrifyce. hew the troncke of a tree / out
of the which issued blood: And how Polidorus declared the sygnyficacyon and
the manner of the said miracle. and the will of the goddys Capm^ iiij
ENeas then by ardeur of great devotion and for affection that he had
humbly to halowe this festyuyte as said is / took an axe cuttynge on both
sides And as I suppose it was after the facion of a glayue or guysarme / with
which he hew and smote down with great might those trees for to arraye and
make fair the said altar. The which trees so cut and entamed by the said
Eneas. issued out in an habondaunte course a sourge of black blood droppynge
down to the earth / And on the same axe in manner of great drops of blood.
by which showing Eneas was greatly abashed and dredefull merueyllynge what
thing that might sygnyfye. And for to have knowleche of this miracle and of
all the faytte thereof. The said Eneas knelyd down on both his knees by great
humylyacyon of heart and devout affectyon. his hondes Joined to fore the said
altar in making request unto the trojan goddys and to the goddys of the
forestes. that they by their divine and ineffable inspyracyon would give to him
knowleche of this materyalle vysion / The which prayer ended and without
having ansuer of the goddys trojans by him adoured and callid on / After by
courage more haultayn without any proud thought / purposed in him self to
arache or pluck up a gretter tree which was there which empesshed and ^etted
him / by force. vygour / and naturalle might without socoure of any
instrumente artifycyalle. And for to demean this to effect / Eneas set
then one knee upon the sonde. and that other ayenste the branche grown and
comen out of the little hylle where as was buried Polydorus / And on that
other side he took the branches of the said tree. and by great might and
bodyli strength / enforced his puyssaunce for to arache and pluck up the same
tree. During the which efforte was herd a voys feeble as of a person all
sorowfulle and bywepte / and nyghe all faylled and deed. The which said alas
Eneeas this is but lytyl prowess to the to prove and excersice thy robuste
puyssaunce ayenste a body pryued from his life / or upon a deed corpse to take
vengeance so Inutyle / And by cause my right dear brother and my good
friend: I very sorrowful which so much have loved the when the life was in me.
and that the naturel hete of blood humayn comfort my membris and made them
vegytalle with sencyble moeuynges / I swear to the by the goddis whom thou
seruest / and whom thou now in perfou^de devotion have required. that thou
cease to trauaylle and poursiwe me deed: For hereof I make the certain / that I
am Polydorus sone of Pryame king of Troy he lyuinge / which have been by
cruel death and trayson hid and couerde under holy amyte. put out of this
world by plasmator king of this country and regyon / For the auaryce
Insacyable which was in him. And that had hardynesse to commyse and do this
crime so much deffamed. and full of so excecrable cruelte arrettyd / O cursid
and false deceyuable auaryce / which blyndeth the voluntees humayn / and
makes by his subtyl art the rich men suffretous and pour and ferther for to
get richesse to commyse crime and homyside by dampnable treason / And I
Plyodorus ferthermore show and manyfeste to the / that the haboundau^ce of
blood which thou haste seen issue out of the trees / which woldeste have
cut and plucked up / is not orygynally of these trees / but the said trees
have taken their fou^demente and first beginning of their rote in my body and

ANd by cause that thou Eneas haste bygonne to edyfye and bylde a new cytee in
this royalme of Trace in the perfection of the same thou procedyng have now
upon ye great materyall fou^dements made bastelles of work and ouuerage
magnyfyke: but ye will of the goddis have ordained and concluded by a counseyl

SO much Polydorus had opened and declared to Eneas the secret of his
vysions / that eneas was surprysed with dread Inestymable all in a trance And
so abode a long time enough like a corpse without entendemente / And without
partycypacyon of sensityf moeuynge. And for tymorysite and thing not acustumed
merueyllous and Insolute. as said is his tongue abode and clyued to the palate
of his mouuth in such manner / that during the langorous time. that polidorus
told this vysion miserable. It was inpossyble to him to excercyse thoffyce of
his tongue to him destynate by nature / nevertheless after that nature had
stablysshed his wit and spyritte and given to each of them faculte and power
to excersice their office and words / The said Eneas ordained that the cause
of Polydorus issued of his blood and genealogye should be restored and hallowed
honors funeralle / And to his goddis make sacryfyces apperteynynge for to get
the grace of them / that they might render them self benygne. mercyful /
debonayr / and propyce unto the health of polydorus

Thobsequyes of Polidorus Capm^ v.
FOr the obsiquyes funeral of Polydorus to bring to effect so was the altar
establysshed for to halowe the sacrifyce / And thereupon put and set the
gods of troy / which were of color sangueyn and reed. and eneas and his
felaushyp^ chosen by him for to make and exhibete the said sacrefyce weren all
generally simple and enuyronned with bendes of his which enuyronned under the
throat mountynge up to the temples between their frontes and eres unto the
top of the heed / And upon their hedes they had chapelettis of branches of
cypress which grew nygh the montycle or lityl hylle where as Polydorus was
buried / which is a tree sacred and ordained to the end that by the vehemente
odor and sweet smelle of the same tree may surmounte the infecte odor of the
caroynes of the deed bodies / And the wymmen of Troy which had followed Eneas
when he departed fro troy were tofore the said altar with our apparayll ne
without retchynge ought by them self in any wise. For the said wymmen were
all dyssheuelled or bare the heed making merueloyus synacles as their custume
was in that time in that country also. and seemed better wymmen out of their
wits than porueyd of cou^tenau^ce or constau^ce

For ye co^so^macio^ of the said sacrifyce eneas ordained to take many cymphes
yt ben vessels ordained for to make such sacrifyce. and ben in manner of lityl
bokettis or lytyl ships of a strange stone. and of diverse colors / as
iaspre porphire / of which some were full of blood of bestis sacrefyed and
other full of milk clear and clean / the which vessellis in habu^dau^ce of
deuoco^n. they came about ye said mo^tycle or lityl hill of polidorus / in
recome^dyng ye said polidorus to the debonnayr clemence and mercyful justice of
the goddis

Then Eneas and all his sequel made them ready for to accomplysshe and leave
the said country of Trase by the admonestement of the said Polydorus sone of
pryame king of Troy / mounted upon the sea. And was there long and mauy
days / So then we shall leave to speak of Eneas / And shall return to
speak of dydo / And first to show the dyfference of John bochace and of
vyrgyle. to put in bryef the fall of the said dydo recounted by bochace /
and after by the said virgyle

Here bigynneth thistorye. how dydo departed from ye country ca.. vjo.
That other day in passing time I r^dde the fall of noblys / of whom Ihon^
bochace has spoken and in brief ye adue^tures of fortune hard and dyuersly
excecrable / and in all destructyue of their personis / honors / gods / and
chyuau^ches of whom the so^me have been cause of there harm and evil and of the
distrucco^n of which some be yet. and how be it that they ben pourueyd much
more yt it apperteyneth to them seen their science prowess vaillya^tyse or
service after the state and their vocaco^n in the which each ought to hold
and be content like as says thappostle without doing grief or any nuysau^ce /
ne to bear do^mage ne myssaye any other / this notwysto^dyng always they be in
awayte / and delight themself to seche often times means for to grieve and to
say words detractiues / whereof follows ye perdyco^n of much people and of
them self in the end / which therein have medeled And after certain space I
had been in beholdynge the peryllous adventures / and fortunes right
sorowfulle / of many kings: princes. or knights and many other / I fond the
fall of dydo sometime queen and fou^^resse of the noble cite of cartage. the
which in redynge I was abashed and had great merueylle / how bochace which
is an auctour so greatly reno^med has transposed or at lest dyuersifyed the
fall and caas otherwise than vyrgyle has in his fourth book of Eneydos / In
which he has not rendered the reason / or made any decysion to approve better
the his than that other And if any would excuse him and say that he had done
hit for better to keep thonour of wymmen. And would not treat ne say thing
of them dyshoneste. but that might be to their auau^cemente This reason has
no place: For he has put in many places other great falls ouermoche
infamous of some queen's and ladies / and has not suffyced to him to speak all
in general. but has made express chapytres / In blaming the complexions of
them By the which partyculerly he shows the dyssolucyons and perverse
condycyons that been in the sex femynyne / And for to show euydently upon the
said caas and fall the dyfference which is of vyrgyle and of bocace. I have
enterprysed to show all a long the text of vyrgyle / The causes and
occasions of the last extynctyon and dolourous death and despyte of the
reno^mee of dydo otherwise called or named Elysse or Fenyce But first and to
fore for better and to understand the matter I have purposed to recyte here the
caas / and fall after the oppynyon of John bocace. which says as here after
shall ensiewe and follow

IF In any manner faith ought to be adiousted unto the wrytynges and dyctes of
old and auncyente chronicles or historyers / Or to their letters cronykes and
historyes / Uneath may men find any of soogrete langage And dygne to give
magnyfycence / and somoche deuyne ^ no^mee / as to the hye name of Fenyce /
whereof the rayson may be this / how be it that thauctour put not precysely
dedycte without text / by cause that the Fenyces were the first Inuentours of
carecteris dyfferencyng that one fro that other* of which were fourmed lettres
for to write and redyng in remembaru^ce perpetual. ye things that they
desireden to late be known to their frendis / or otherwise for the
conseruacyon of their deeds / fayttes. and scyences / to the end that they
might reduyce in souuenau^ce or remembrance. by thynspection and lecture of
their wrytyngys. that which by length of time and debylyte of entendement
should be wythdrawen / Or otherwise should have be forgoten it and put in
oublyau^ce. that the fenyces fond to note with read color or ynke first the
said lettres / of which our books ben gretely decorate. socoured and made
fair. We write the great and first capytall lettres of our volumes books and
chapytres with the taynture of reed color:

THe name then and royalme of Fenyce has be much hiely decored by
merueyllous arts / and myryfyke / In ioyouse preysynge and laud whereof the
clerenes and fame of his ouurages has been dyuulged and showed unto the last
clymate of bonds habited with lygnage royalle Out of the which Fenyce and
prosapye auncyenne / as it is to believe by their wrytynges / issued a king
named Belus / After the death of whom / one his sone named pygmaleon succeeded
him / And obtained the royalme of the Fenyces He had also a daughter named
Elysse. which afterward was named dydo and was married to one named Acerbe /
otherwise called Sychee his uncle was priest of hercules honored well in the
royame of thyre. and the gretest of all the cou^treye after the king of the
same / This gentylman was much fair to byholde young / and playsau^t of great
reverence / right honorable emonge them of the country / of great audacyte /
and of name magnyfyque right much byloued of Elysse / Then his wife. which
then he loved also much of fine love without fayntasie which sone after
failed by his death anguysshous. whereof then^e it happed after the Judgment
that to him was fortunat / that he was so brenewrous that he was emonge all
other esteemed to be most in Joy and gladness. considering the beauty and bounte
of dydo his wife. And also of great rychesses / of which Acerbe otherwise
called Sychee was much endowed and had preemynence in right great
habundau^ce:

BY the couetyse of which goods and rychesses / pygmalyon brother of Elysse
and king of the country was sore esprysed / For which cause the death was
conspyred of the fair Sychee. the said pygmalyon thinking in himself to do
slay him. And by this moyen he should attain to the end of his desire and will
insacyable and full of couetyse. And so to him self he should all usurp his
great and Innumerable rychesses / and like as he thought / he did / and did do
slay Acerbe or Sychee / Then dydo his sweet and amyable spouse and wife bare
it much inpacyentli and sorowfully / and in such anguysshe of heart / that
she swowned syncopysed and syghed / And out of her fair sweet eyes / and
tender flowed teeris assyduatly and contynuelly. that they better seemed two
great sourges wellynge up great affluence of teerys. which ran down by her
fair and fresh vylage / And thus the said dydo suffered great pain for the
great and hard syghynges and heuynesses. by cause of ye great horriyle /
nephande / and detestable crime. perpetred and commysed in the person of
sychee her sweet and late amyable husbonde / long time demeaned she such
clamours without any hope ever otherwise to live. And always she considering
the causes of the said crime / and the couetyse of her said brother pygmalyon /
And that many times by dremes and other admonestements was often times incyted
and cou^seylled to seche some place sure and secret / And then of
thobeyssaunce of the said pygmalyon / for the surete of her person she comened
with the princes of the same country and specially with the pryncipall which
had be friends of Sychee late her husbonde / and showed to them the causes
by the which she had conceived this great hate ayenste her brother pygmalyon
/ whom she drew to her part and side. and were content to do all that /
which by her should be aduysed / for to wythstande the cursed enterprise of
her said brother. which had concluded in him self and to fore thought / Then
sone after a wyke. Elysse faynynge that she ne might no longer duelle in the
house of Acerbe late her husbonde. by cause that she was ouermoche moleste and
grieved by recordynge continuel in rememarbu^ce pietous of the sweet mayntene
and semblau^ce of the said Sychee her preteryte husbonde. But she incyted.
frequented often the places in which she had first seen her true friend and
love sichee / And therefore with all the hauoyr and other goodis of the said
Acerbe that he posseded in his life right gladly she welde dispose her self to
goo unto the royame of fenyce the country of her nayssau^ce and birth unto
pygmalion her brother / which when he herd of it was much Joyous /
supposy^ge^ by that moyen to come to his insacyable and cursyd auaryce / for to
have all the rychesses and other grodes to fore said. Forthwyth the said
pygmalyon sent unto his suster dydo a flote of ships well manned and
garnysshed for to bring with her the goods. and rychesses of the said royame
of Their in to fenyce unto him / But dydo by other barate as she then had
ordained / and that always thought to eschew and gaynstonde the fraud of her
said brother: took and hid privily in a certain place of her ship all the
great tresours and hauoyrs of her said sometime husbonde sichee. And in the
place where they were she set many sackes full of brass and coper. the
which all manyfestely or openly in the presence of all her people. which
supposed then / that it had been the tresour of her late husbonde / And did
it to betaken from thens and to carye and bear hit to the ship at even with
thoo people which to fore is made mencyon / And the messagers of the said
king pygmalyon which were comen to fetch her / mounted upon the said ship
for to goo in to fenyce. And when they were well on the way out of the land
in the hye see. she commanded to cast out the sackes of brass and coper /
where they in the ship had supposed that it had been the tresours that she
brought with her And that done she said to them weeping these incitatyf
words. Dear felawes and friends of our nauye / I doubt nothing but that ye
have the will for taccomplysshe that which I commau^de you / whythoute to
ask or will to know any wise this which ye have done / But for to say and
tell to you the cause which have moeued me thus to do I have much lieuer to
have lost all the richesses of Acerbe late my friend and husbond. the which
ye have now drowned within the belly of the sea / than I should deliver them in
to the hands of the right cruel king Pygmalyon my brother. for the which
rychesses to hane of me / after that he has taken the life away fro my sweet
and true husbonde he has sent you hider for to bring me to him with his
ships / And therefore think veryli that it bihoueth you presenly to do and
hold me company. or else deye / or flee from him / ye hane known enough his
great and cursid auaryce. And how he has do slay Acerbe or Syche my late
husbonde for to have of him his tresours. wherefore I doubt not that now after
the rychesses lost if we goo to him / he shall be so surprysed with anger and
furyouse woodnes / when he shall see him self so deceived and put fro his
entente that he shall much sore tormente us / and at the end put us to death.
the which since that he has wythdrawen and taken away him / which was all
my well / I shall take it in gree and gladly. But I have compassyon of you.
which in this caas have no culpe ne blame / of the grievous pains and
miserable torments of which he shall make you to have by afflyctyon / And
therefore late us treat by one acorde / if ye will flee from the country of
my brother with me / and eschew his great furour / I shall abandoune my life
with you my good cytezeyns which be here in dangeour of miserable death / And
offer my self to bring and conducte you in to some other place of surete.
where as we shall live more at our ease. in places of Joyous dwelling.
without to have more dread of him / ne of the great doubt and fere of his
cruel tyranny / thus were moeued and attyred by thexhortacyon of dydo and her
sweet monicyons and pyetous prayers / all the maronners of one accord with
all the other in the ship How well it was to them much hard a thing to
habandoune and leave the sweet country of their natiuyte / All that
notwythsta^dyng they accorded and greed to do all her will / and the prores or
forship which lay toward the country of their turned anon toward the royame
of Cypre for to goo in to that country / There fond they the priest of
Iubyter with his wife and all his meyne vaticynau^te of prophecyeng things
much merueyllous. in pronostycacyon right happy of their fleeynge and voyage.
the which with his wife and meynage went anon with them. and not knowing in
to what country for to soiourne and pass forth their yongthe in some place
of peace and of surete for to abide. Also to the end that their name perysshe not
without remembrance for fault of lygnee / And a while they abode in the
country / which were well pleased with their conuersacyon. and maryages of
their daughters to them in eschewynge to fall in to old age. not socoured
with chidren and maynage / which should issue of their lygnage for tenhabyte
the country and maintene their name and remembrance perpetuel / And in
conclusion they decended from their ships to the land. and at the ryuage of
the same they took in deed lxx maidens. and anon put them in to their
ships the which after the custom auncyen of the cypriens thider comen
received for to win ye duete of marriage with men of all countries and
nacyons that thider came fro all parties / And sith after made festes and
sacryfices to venus the goddess. For after during their marriage / to be
observed holden and kept chaste all the time of their life. as if they offered
to the said venus their last sacrifyces and obsequyes for to goo out fro her
subiectyon. and to be from her exempte from then forthon:

How dydo arrived in Lybye a strange country and boughte as much land or
ground / as she might conteyne within the space of the hide of an ox. in
which she builded and edyfied the cite of Cartage / Capm^ vij
ANd from thens departed dydo with all her nauye in passing the sea. and
always wythdrawynge fro the said land of fenyce arrived upon the ryuage of
affryque for to repair her ships / And there boughte of thynhabitau^tis of
the same country as much land or ground / as she might enuyronne with the
hide of an ox / which did do corroye well. and after did do cut hit so
in a thonge so small and long that she enuyronned much more quantyce of the
ground of the said country than the Inhabytantes sellars supposed should ever
have been. In the said place during the time that dydo and her felawshyp^.
which by long time had been in great trauaylle upon the sea / which much
had grieved them. and thrown them in mani diverse countries were then
under the proteccyon and sweet reconsilyacyon and rest / they did do repair
their nauyre / and set it with / great pain all in point with all things
to them necessary. Then thenhabytan^s and their neighbors by / began to
treat with them curtoysly. and often vysited them without to do to them
any grief / moleste or thing that ought to dysplease them / but with all gre
and frendlynes without putting on them lothlynes as strangers. They of the
country byganne to hold parlyamente with them. and took amytyes and alyau^ce
with them / and admynystred to them marchau^dyses. and did all other
things. which is acustumed to be done between neighbors and good friends:
Then dydo and her barons seeing the fruytful dysposicyon and bounte of the
said place seemed to them that they ought to make an end of their fuyte or
fleeynge / and anon elysse or dydo to them dyscouerde the fraud that she had
don / and showed wherefore she had thrown in to the sea the sackes a foresaid
full of brass and coper / semynge that hit had been the tresour of Sychee her
late husbonde / which then she showed to them. whereof then they were much
Joyous and greatly encoraged with good hope / and concluded anon to build and
edefye a new cite there / And cast and took the fou^dement for to make a cite
there / and there they aboode all to gyder / And in so making they fond
within the ground in diggyng to make the fou^dementes the head of an horse.
which gaaf to them hardynes / courage and destyne to preysinge of the place
to be propyce and acceptable. the which was then^e purposed to be closed and
enuyro^ned with wallis autentyke / And the cite was named as some say Cartage
by cause that the cyrcuyte of the place was enuyronned with the thonge of a
skin or hyde as to fore is said. And the castle of the town was named brose
taking his name of the hide of an ox / which they hof Tir called burse*

THis cite in short espace for the co^modytees of the same. and situacyon
plentyuous was strongly enhabited with much folk and people / Of whom dydo was
lady and queen. and gaaf to them laws and manner of living and governance

fame and renomee florysshyng shone and resplendysshed merueyllously in the
countries circu^iacent and neighbors in such wise that they which had lived
after the manner of that country. which was all dissonau^t and dishoneste in

chastyte and prudence augmented unto all naco^ns strangers far and nyghe /

king of the musitaynes or momydes neighbor to that country was right
fervently esprised in ye love of this queen then^e being wydowe / as said is of
her first husbond sychee / and sent to some princes of that cite whom he
required to have this queen dydo in marriage / saying by great menaces if he
had her not / that he should reduce that cite into ruin. and should put all
the people thereof in to exyle / This thing seenge the said princes and knowing
the ferme purpos permanable. which ye queen had to e^terteyne her pudyque
chastyte in perpetual wydowhed / durst not at ye first manyfeste the petycion

some words serving to their entenco^n / and upon the which they might find
fou^dement and rayson indycatyf for to moeue thereto the said dydo / they
reported to her yt the king for to lead a life more honest / demanded them
for to have some prince of thyre or thyrayn / for tenstructe him in doctrynes
and good manners and condycyons to live after the manner of their country which
to him seemed more honest and aggreable than his own / which for to do they
knew no man co^uenyent and propyce for so much that none of the country but
if he were co^streyned would leave his own land for to goo unto such a king
that used so vile / terryble and strange life And always if there went none to
him / he menaced and thretenyd to make war and fight with them. whereof might
fall other danger and great peril to their new cite. The which princes the
queen repreued / showing to them that for one man only ought not be cause to
lose all the other and to habandou^e their country and life accustomed. and to
use such as beestes savage do as works synystres and barbaires / O right
good cytezeyns. if it happened that one must deye for the salute and well of

How a king neighbor to cartage did demand to wife the fair dydo queen if

determined considering that hit might be none other wise. but she must
promise to make this marriage / the which she accorded to them and held for
gre^ble / And demanded Induces and space of three months. In which time she

during as it may be presupposed if any deffence was in the cite which was
not set and ordained in couenable fortyfycacyon / She did it incontynente to
be set in point And after this she blamed long her beaulte in cursyng it by
great execracyon with the great envy that fortune had upon her and the
Joyous adventures and prosperous which were in late time comen to her / So
that the great playsaunce which she had taken with the sweet rest of her

THe which caas here presupposed is in accordaunce enough. which speaks of
the lygnage and marriage of dydo / Of the death also perpetred by pygmalyon king

upon the ryuage of the sea in the place where she byganne first to edyfye
Cartage. And of the fortunes aduenturouse which happened in that so making
that byfelle to her and to them of their company But for to show the
difference that I find of the death of the said dydo / I shall reherce here
after now in a another manner. which is to be presupposed was moeued of the
great hate and evil will that June the goddess conceived against paris / his

was in his desire pryncypally above all other. In which thing so doing she
would reward them with such guerdons as apperteyneth to great and hie goddys

lygnage and very alyes / and socoure them with all her might / which that
the goddys had granted to her right gladly. And they made their preperacyon
eueryche in his regyon / for to war upon Eneas:

On that other side came upon them Neptunus with all his vorages and wawes all

How dydo cou^seyllid with her suster anne: Capm^ xj
THis lady bythoughte herself and purposed to dyscoure and manyfeste her
faytte unto one her suster which was named in that time Anne saying to her in
this manner / Anne my suster and friend I am in right great thought strongely
troubled and incyted / by dremes admonested which excyte my courage tenquire
the manners and lygnage of this man thus valyau^t / strong / and puyssau^t /
which deliteth him strongly to speak / in deuysing the hie fayttes of arms
and perillys dangerous which he says to have passed / ne weli hither common
to soiourne in our countries. I am so persuaded of great admonestments that all
my ente^dement is obfusked / endullyd and rauysshed / I believe certainly that
the man of whom I speak to you is nyghe kynne and parent of ye goddis / or
that verytable by one common asse^tmente they have assembled them self to
destyne his birthe in delyuerynge and gyuyng to him allone all the high
virtuous yeftes. which nature has of custume partyculerly to give to diverse
creatures / and may be supposed that she has produced him in excellent
dygnyte. for to make one fayer chief work / to thexemplayre of all other /
For they which ben borne of basse parentage. ben over much ferdeful and
convert in their fayttes / and dread them fleing and keep them out of the
palayces and courts of great lords / And if it happen them to enter. anon
they return or hide them in corners under the tapytes or byhinde the great
foot of the ya^e for to issue and goo out first without making any bruyt or
medlynge ne seche nothing but thyssue for to flee. if there were any medlee /
ne never by them was there any valyan^ce proved as it is said / But god
forbede that it may be said of Eneas that fortune vaynquyssheur of great
bataylles coming to the chief of all enterpryses to have reproach by any of
our said words / For if it that ne were that I have purposed fermely in my
courage to abide and be in wydowhede all the time of my life / after the death
dolourouse and cursid of my sometime husbonde Sychee. which bare away my
first love with him / when he was leyde under therthe. by thenuyous remors and
grievous remembrance of my passed marriage. wherein I have had so many goods of
honor and of curtosie. of whom the remembrance sleeth me and scourges me
always / I should lightly have conse^ted to thallyau^ce of this man. Anne I
confess for troth that since the miserable death of Sycheus and wicked to say
co^mysed in the house of my brother / of which the goddys be all maculate /
This man only has molyfyed my wits and perturbed the courage of mine opinion
first. and has reduced to remembrance the delycyouse traces of mine ancient
love. But not for that / I desire and wysshe that erste thabysme of thobscure
earth swolowe me / or the great fader almighty to plonge and submerge me under
the botomes of the deep palusshe infernalle rather than to my pudyque chastyte
should be done by me any wrong ne vyolence / nor that thy right I should
contrary nor break for no thing that ever can hap to me by no manner wise in
this world / Alas he that me spoused first / has my love entierly with him /
whereof inreuocable a yefte I do make to him. so byseche I him to keep hit
well within his grave under the cold marbyl stone. and not to be separed from
his soul This request sighynge made she to him / and tendrely weeping called
again the old sorrow. which smote and wounded her to the heart. so much that
the bosom of that sorrowful lady was entyerly replenysshed all with teeres:

edyfyces of Cartage. cheryssheth and enterteyneth him to her power in all
things that she thinks to be playsaunt and agreeable unto him / and at last
she yet speaking her speech deffaylleth all suddenly and can not keep purpos

with over great love inestymable / Of it that other part she does make great
appareylles for to feeste Eneas right highely in dyuersitees of metes

After she takes a delectacyon in his talking playsaunte / requyrynge him that

And emonge she takes in her lap Ascanyus the sone of Eneas otherwise called

Considering the beaultye and great delectacyon of the fadre. In which she is

greuable. but that it is all enough facylle unto her to be experymented for
the entreteynynge of her love wherinne she might be deceived for the great
search that she does without cease for to eschew all things that in this
caas might be nocible and contrary to her:

ANd for by cause of the which foresaid occupacyon or contynuelle thought
wherinne she is Inexplycable occupied as transported and rauysshed All the
works and doings of Dydo are tarried and left in the astate of Inperfection.
The w^rkes of the great yates / toures and othre edyfyces that were begone for
the perfectyon of Cartage. be left without any more werkyng all Imperfyt: the
excercyse of arms is dyscontynued. the noble men wexe robuste and rude
without excersice of fayttes of werre. The brydges / poortes and passages ben
left without ward / And the deffences ben void add emptye without
entreteynynge / ready to receive the enmyes without any contradyctyon: All
works ceassen and appyeren interrupte for defaulte of conductours / The stones

fulle of lothlinesse The great edyfyces are left uncovered in diverse places /
And shortly all falls in to ruin. by cause of her great furoure But Juno
the noble goddess wedded wyff and spouse of Iubyter seeing that the good
renomme of Elysse might notte contryste ayenste her great desire embrasid with
the sweet flamme of love / Considering also that the goodely and great chere
of Dydo might be cause to make Eneas to abide in Cartage / without to pass
any ferther toward ytalye / would speak to the goddess Venus for to do
conuencyon of Eneas with the said Dydo / and then byganne to say unto her by
a manner of derysion the words herinne written / Certes Venus thou and thy sone
Cupydo are gretely to be praised and ye shall do a great conqueste. whereof ye
shall be had in perpetuell renommee / if a woman might be by you two
vaynquysshed. whereof the motyue that has attysed you to that / and the cause
whi ye have enough induced elysse to condescende to the love of eneas is to my
semyng come for the dread that ye have of the tyrauntes and of them of
affryque / and also of them of the high walls of our cytee of cartage For
the wyhyche dread to pease ye will do alyaunce with them by means of the
marriage of dydo with eneas. which thing might be brought to effect / so that
ye will be favorable and gracyous toward eneas without to bear him fro hens
forth any moleste or lettynge / And for all debates to accord and pease /
and to bring all noyes at an end. I give mine assente to a peace eternalle
for the constructyon and making of the said marriage as ye do desire to the
which shall mow dydo eassyly acorde during this / that the great furour
enfla^med with brennyng desire of love esprysed within her sinews / perse ye
bones of her presently. and then of one common assent we Juno and venus
goddesses shall have all the domynacyon and gouermente entierly of thise two
peoples / that is to wit of the trojans in so much as touches them of
Eneas that shall be taken in dowayr to Dydo for her marriage and like wise them
of Thyre that are common with Elysse: shall then be subgette unto Enee. the
which we shall Join togydre. And of them two we shall make all one people
/ Whereof Cartage shall be peopled. and also the country:

THe which things thus said / Venus that doubted leest Juno would accord the
foresaid marriage to the entente that Eneas should abide in Ca^tage for this
cause. and should leave the enterprise by him made to goo. and conquer the
royalme of Ytalye / that Juno said that she had in her governance / was well
glad seynynge to understand otherwise the entencyon of the said Juno.
wheronto she purueyd well after ward. And aunsuerde unto her saying / he
that would gaynsaye this alyaunce / and with the Juno to steyne. for to let
thy deliberacyon / should well be out of his wit. If thou woldeste
accomplysshe by effect this that thou mayntenest be thy wordee / but I am not
well certain / if Iubyter the puyssaunte god / that has / the dysposicyons of
all things in his hand / shall be content that the tyryns and the trojans
shall people in common this cite of Cartage without some deuysion. And also if
our marriage and alyaunce for to speak shall be unto him aggreable / And by
cause then that unto the Juno that art his wyffe and flawe apperteyneth more
better than to any other to know of him his playsure. Thou shalt undertake
this charge if hit playse the to goo without taryeng. and I shall follow the
all of nyghe / Whereof Juno taking in hand the conduytte of this work / was
well content and said in this manner sith that I have taken the charg of this
work I wol tell and show clerly how the thing shall mow be brought
about. Eneas and dydo sore taken with his love have purposed for to goo chasse
and hunte the wild bestes incontinent that the son making to morrow his
rysynge shall have transmysed his shynynge bemes for to Illustre clear all the
earth / And when they shall be to the vttir most of the game well chaffed
aftre the bestes I shall suddenly make the air to wexe obscure and all
black replenysshed with hayle / rain and horrible tempeste by the air and by
the earth wyndes and great orages / I shall girde all the heueus with thondres
lyghtnynges choruscacyous and merueyllouse tourmentes that shall rain the
country ouere right Impetuously so that all the air shall seem to be
covered with the night fulle blak and obscure / Then shall all the hunters
flee away and othre fro the said chasshe with so great haste that they shall
not wene to find sone enough a place for to be in sauete / And by this manner
I shall do that the duke Eneas and Dydo fleing the wedrynge shall render
hemself both togydre all alone as by veraye destynacye and by rencountre of
adventure under agrete hylle withyn a cave at the end of the forest / And
there they shall find me Juno that am lady of the maryages and do couple
them two with my sone hyemen which is named the god of wedding / And /
therefore if I wist that thou venus were not of accord fo the maryag of eneas
to dydo I should make him first to depart without any respyte /

Of the great tempest and storne at marriage of them / Capitulo Decimoquinto
UEnus was then well content without any contradyctyon / and byganne to

to accomplysshe this marriage / Whereof she was syn after well deceived by cause
that she made it to couertely and close without testymonage / and without the
knowleche of Iubyter: The which enterprise thus made / after that the spring

Assembled their rennynge hounds two and two together / and chose them one from

to be at the reysynge of the beeest for to run after. The other for to be
set at the relesse. and the other for to entermedle and redress their

O Iupyter almighty god for whom folk of Moryenne where is made the roughe

tremoure and feere / will thou feere us only with thy fyres by the suddenly

all to that without rightwisnes to be by the made unto every chone /

How Yarbas complained him to Jupiter of eneas that edefyed the cite of Cartage
/ and how Iupyter sent suddenly Mercuryus toward eneas for to make him to
return in to the country of ytalye Capitulo xvj
WE compain to thy ryghtwysnesse of a woman which is come in to the lymytes

only the delites of wyme^ly love. wherein he is contynuelli ocupyed with her.
and we that all the time of our life have served to thy temple / done many
sacrifyces and oblacyons to thy lawde and praysinge / are despised and
habandouned without to bring there from some reward or a vau^tage. the which
yarbas making this his complaynt and prayer wrthin the temple before the awters
the god almighty Iupyter that would exalte his request turned his look a side
toward the walls and habytauntes of the cytee of Cartage where he knew the
two lovers without remembrance of their first good fame that they had
forgoten

And then called to him Mercuryus which is interpretour of the gods. And
commanded him to do the message here written saying / My sone mercure goo
lightly take thy wings empared with fedders / Call the sweet wyndes and goo
down with them toward Eneas the duke troien which is now tarried within
Cartage for to enhabyte there / having no mind ne recordaunce for to goo

at her request we kept and saved him two times against the greeks his enemies
And gaffe him vyctorye one time against Dyomedes and a nothre time against
Achylles when at both the times he enterprysed for to do arms against them
before the great Troy / But unto us did promise his said modre to make him
more cheualerouse than any othre of his time in such awyse that he should be
dygne by excellence above all othre. to obtain by bataylles the conqueste
vyctoryouse of the rich and second empire of Ytalye / And that thrughe his
great worthynesse and hygh^ fayttes he should bring up again the great and
first renomme of the troiens and all the world subgeit to his laws / And if
he had his heart so hard Inclyned to the playsure of his fowlle delyces. That
the desire gloryouse to conquer one such lordshyp / could not mow bring him
there to as touchythe honor of his own person / At the least that he have

posteryte of ytalye and the rich possessions of lauyne / goo thou forth
incontinent to give him commandment in our byhalue that he parfournyshe his

Mercuryus-desyrynge to acomplyshe the commandment of his granfadre Iupyter
appointed him self fulle soon for to fullefylle his will / And first he made
fast at his heles his great wings over gilt that bare him with the wyndes
aswelle over see as over earth high and low where someuere he would be and
took the cepter Imperyalle of his dyuynyte / by means of the which he drew
some sowles out of hell and made hem to come up ahighe to the light / the
other he took out of lyff and sent hem in to hell / Also with his rode he made
some to fall a sleep without neuere to wake. and the other he made to watch
without cease / And with this rod fleeynge he devised the four wyndes and
departed the troublouse clouds that he recoumtred in his way / And
trauersynge from one land to another he perceived in lokynge all of far the
high sholders and sides of the strong Athlas that sustained the heuens upon
his hedde. This Athlas was a geant str^ng and mighty a boue all the other /
and because that ye he^ens were not steadfast of one side and sometime did bow
at other part the gods did turn him in to a high mountain for to
sustain the heuens And upon his head instead of ^^rys he is all garnysshed of
sapyn trees and of holy trees that be contynully beten and cast of the wyndes
and sore covered with clouds fulle derke / his sholdres are covered with snow
at all season of the year. and out of his great chyne issue^ great flodes

the borders and shores instead of here is ben garnyshed with thycke yse) And
incontinent the said mercuryus drew thyderwarde for to festye the said athlas
yt was his uncles brother unto his mother named lay / and set himself upon
his sholdres where he was a while to rest him / And after took his flyghte as
a bird straight toward the sea of lybye fleyng low and syn hie resting
himself upon the roches alonge the shores of the sea. taking his dysportes as
a bird that pruneth or pycketh her / so that he came by process of time from a

and from thens he entered within cartage. where he fond eneas that builded
towers and other great edyfices. all ocupyed for to make up the cytee of
cartage / and had a bystorye or wepen crysolite / as it were a lityl sword

said Mercuryus / yet speaking vaynyssed out of eneas sight. as a thing that
one see of far / always drawing from him abak till that it is seen no more:
Whereof this eneas was sore afraid of the great vysion d^yfyque that he had

heeres byganne to gresell and dress upward / the arteres formatyue of speech
were stopped within him / in somoche that he might not speak for the great
horror and fere that he had had. desiryng abowe all things to flee and leave

immense nor by what ways he may notyfye thees things to Dydo. ne what terms
he shall take at the beginning of his words / himself to valyde and to give a
color to his byfalle / and abode long in this thought doubtouse and
varyable. without to set his purpose to condescende to any part of that he
would do unto the end that it seemed him for the best to call three of his
knights / One named Nestor a another Sergeste / and the third is the strong
Cloant. to whom he commanded that all secretly they should do make ready his
ships / assemble their folk / take their armeures and all other
appareylle for to depart inco^tynent yt he should ordeyne. And that they should
do this covertly in dyssymulyng their going / to the end that if it were
aperceyued by some way / men should wene that it were a manner of a feynynge:

How dydo knowing the departing of eneas ran through the cytee of cartage as a
woman disperate and from herself Capitulum xvij
THe felawes right gladly did fulfylle right soon the commandment of eneas /
the which trowynge that dydo should never have thought upon ye brekyng of so
great a love. nor that he would habandoune and leave her stro of with himself /
by what ways he might signyfie it unto her. in what words / or what hour /
and in what manner most honest for to give her less sorrow. But the queen
dydo atysed of the great couetyse enfla^med with desirouse love that can never
be sacyate enough / felt first this barate / by cause that the fine lover
that always keeps him self within his ward. and fyndeth no thing so
sure. but that he puts it in a doubt. can not be lyghtely dece^uyd. For
fame that evil goddess reports unto her that Eneas made his nauye to be
armed and repaired. whereby she ymagyneth first / that he did so for to
depart and goo out of her land and Inco^tynente as all furyouse and out of
her wit. took to styre her self and ra^ne through ye city of car^age as a

Bachus and Venus at the day of their solempnyte

How dydo sorowfully bewaylled the departing of Eneas by sweet and amyable
words Capitulu^ xviij
ANd thus rennynge about she recounted Eneas to whom by great dyscomforte
reforced with merueyllouse sorrow / whereof her heart was surprysed in great
accumylacyon of extreme dysplaysur. she said these words half by manner of a
reproach in dolaunte lamentacyons rewthes and complayntes / O right dear eneas
sedycious and right cruel how haste thou had the heart so untrue to think so
great a treson / as for to will depart out of my land suddenly. without to

have you purposed to mou^te upon ye see and to flee from my psence / for to goo

queen I answer not. but that thou haste deserved of me much more of goods
than I can nombre or by some wise think ne tell. and so shall I remember

and to be at my fre will I should take habytaco^n in the great troy with my
kynsmen and other that are there abyden. escaped from the distructo^n And yet
should troy be made up again by me / but the god Appollo of the cytee of
tymbre with the oracles in short preceptyue of the land of lycye / co^man^den
me to goo in to ytalye. and sith that it must be thus done. it is my land and
my desire to accomplish all their will / And it seems that you ought not in
no wise to reprehende me ne to have envy upon ye trojans of their going in to
ytalye a strong land out of their nacyon / since that you art of thire. come
from the mean regyons of fenyce to enhabyte in libye and to take thy playsure
in thy great edyfyces of cartage that thou do make presently for to preside

out of strange land is licyte to seek strange / places for their / dwelling.
And it should be a shame to me that have enterprysed the conquest of ytalye to
reside in this land of lybie without to acoonplishe my wyage which thing for

Also of a another side I am sore conturbed with a dread merueyllous. for the

ALas I have received this man pour miserable and nausraged upon the ryuage of

lyuered to death I have delivered them therfrom and received in to my cite / not

what anguyshe / what lesyng what treson full of desperaco^n / how he swereth
that the god Apollo by his aunsueres and angurements / the sorts preceptyue of

right sone in to ytalye / O all puissaunt light permane^t / before whom no

lamentacyons. whereof I shall make my report unto the pryue goddis being in
the low shadows:

How dydo fell down in a swone / and how and in what manner she was borne
away by her wymen. and also how dyligently the nauye of eneas was made ready
for to goo in to ytalye Capitulum xxi
IN saying the which words how be it. that dydo had de purposed to say much
more / she brake her speech all at ones by right great sorrow. Took and
dystourned her eyes from the light where she was inn / And fell in a swoune
as all ded to the ground. she was soon take up by her wymnen that bare her
in to her chamber marbryne. and leyd her upon alityl bed. Whereof Eneas how be
it. that he had great pity and compassyon of her and desired sore to comfort
her with sweet and amyable words for to assuage her sorrow in great sobbynges
/ for great displaysure and sorrow yt he had. to see his sweet love suffer
such a pain / Always he determined himself and went his ways for to see his
ships / Then when his folk and maryneres saw him / they did hie hemselfe
yet more fast to work for to haste their going / transported the most part
of the nauye that was talowed / and well garnysshed with pytche / out of the
haven in to the rode. made oores of wood all grene coming new out of the
forest / and took also right great trees and foyson of other tymbre for to
apropre to their other besinesses in great desire to depart fone hens. ye
should se trojans of all sides that ran some dou^warde / and the other upward.
all of one will to have furnysshed their ships. even so as pysmers are
wou^te to do. dredyng sore the winter / when they have found a shokke of whete
or other corn. goo sone out of their nest and all by one way. for to bear

draw after them ye / that they can not bear that other commands and
sets hem all in order a another forseth him self to swepe the place. a another
keeps that other bystoweth it. And the other incyteth to make dyligence / one
renneth. a another comes again / and that other seeks what to lade him self
with all. a another has somoche laden that he late fall some by the way / And
then^e he calls for help. so that the way is never delivered of them.
till that they have done their besinesses Alas Dydo where is thy wit bycome.
thy fair maynteyn and sweet countenance. what good. what Joy / and what
playsure nor solace of Ioyefull remembrance may thou have byholdyng upon
these things / What treys and great sighynges / what complayntes callynges and
lamentacyons did issue that time out of thy sweet breast when thou were in the
high lotfe of thy great towers and saw the sea all troubled and tourmented
with ships and orys / O right great love Importunate to who me all thing
diffycile / seems to be facile for to come to her intent how have thou so
great strength over the courage human. This dydo for to serve the now
fonndreth all in teeris. after parforceth herself by prayers and after
submytteth hersilf to all dangers / and to all things diverse. leueth
nothing how strong that it is. how sharp. hard nor great / but that she will
parforce herself for to experimente them all or ever she delybere herself
utterly to the death / After she did do call anne her suster germayne and to
her recyteth apart of her sorrow and with great rewthe byganne thus to say
unto her / Anne behold and see how this folk haste hemself and assemble from
every side in to the haven they have drawn up already their high saylles upon
the great mastes of their ships all spread abroad against the wyndes
desirynge and waiting after the storm for to lead hens the nauye all attones
which they have garnyshed with flowers and garlandes and with crowns in sign
of Joy and gladness that makes my sorrow and heaviness to be much the greter /
Allas if I had well thought to have fallen in the Inconuenyent where I find
now myself ynne I would have purueied thereto in such wise / That I should not
have come by no way to this greuouse tourment of mortalle sorrow where I am
so far come In to the bytternes of great myserie / that by no wise I can not
bear it no longer / socorus to the must I then seek my sweet suster and my
right dear friend / save my body. save me my life. and for to do this I pray
and require the. that one message only it playse the for to do for me. toward
that traitor. that man of evil corag. that has loved the greatly / and has
vtterd his secrets unto the entierly so that thou know this condico^ns and
his deeds / the places / the hours and mouementes and the oportunyte of the
time most propy^e for to speak with him. Goo then and ne my suster with all
humylite / to require mine e^mye mortal the false eneas which is against me so
fyers. showing unto him pietously / how I have not be in no wise / thynkinge
nor consentyng in the cursed isle of Aulite when of one assente all the greeks
folk swore that troy should be distroyed / The hard conspyracion of the same
great excysion was made far from my land. and never socours ne comfort by
me nor of my supporte was given to them for to do that my ships nor my
army were never sent thither for to give greuaunce to the twians / nor never
of me came evil unto them. nor no thing that was to them nuysible Also I have
not rented vyolated ne broken the pyramyde of his faders sepulture. I never
did amys. nor never offended against him / whereby he ought to leave me aside /
Infestau^ce obprob^e ne vytupere to anchises when he lived that called him
fader of Eneas. another to his soul after his death / were never ^on of my
behalue / Alas why suster in showing these things unto him / wit of him /
why he has me in such indygnacyon / that he refuses to lene his eeres / for
to understand my words. that been so just and reasonable. as thy self
know: O he will now goo so hastily at this time which is so dau^gerouse
/ at leeste that it may playse him to grant a yefte to me his sorrowful
love. that is only / that he will tarry and dyfferre his departing unto the
new time / that the sweet wyndes shall put hemselfe up in pacifycaco^n of
the sea pestilencyall. that then^e shall permytte him facely and lightly for
to do his vyage safly. I do not somone him for taccomplysshe his premyse
simulatyue of the marriage of us two / nor yt he leave his purpose for to goo in
to ytalie / but I require only that he put this thing in delay for a certain
space of time / During the which I may induce my self to sorrow and that
infortune admynystre to me my sorrows by process of time one after a another
without to suffoke me now vtterli in to the deep see of amaritude without any
reysing / so do I pray the my suster having of me remembrance / that it
playse the to goo and make unto him this my present request / and thus doing
I shall make the mine heir to enjoy and receive after my death ye renues of
all my land

How eneas brake the oken tree for the great love of dydo Capitulum xxii
The which things thus said by dydo. Anne her s^ster went incontinent toward
eneas to make unto him her feeble legaco^n. the which he would no^ grant by
cause that the dyuyne co^mau^dementis inhibytores that had stopped his eeres of
pite were contrary to the same. and many goynges and comynges were there made
of the said a^ne from one part to the other / that fynably were all frustratoire
/ and percisted eneas / like as a great oak tree a^tyque and inuetered of many
years among the great stones hard strongely roted. which is often cast of
many wyndes and orages whereof the four wyndes happen often to assemble togider
one against ye other for to ouerthrawe him dou^e and with their great blastes
taken his hie branches which they shake and bow unto ye ground / and make
hem to braye and ^rie by impetuouse moenynges tendyng to distroye him vtterli /
whereof ye great trone ancient that the more that he is old / hie brau^ched /
spacyouse and great. the more thick and depper ben his rotes spread with in
therthe and related bytwyxth hard roches. abides ever still ferme and moeueth
by no wise. In like wise did semblable Eneas that how be it ye he was strongli
impelled in his courage by ye persuasio^s and hard lame^taco^ns confyte in
pietous teeres re^nyng dou^e the sweet face of dydo / that he somoche derly had
loved. and by her was restored from death to life / from a^guisshe and calamyte
in to right great prosperity / whereof ye remembrance grieved him right
sorowfully by incytaco^n compatyble which admo^nesteth him to socoure this
dolant lady / the which by her suster makes him to be induced to do the same
/ by many exhortaco^ns and pyetous remo^strances excytatiue of all well wyllyng
noryce of love in dylecto^n mutuelle of sweet charity / condolau^t over them yt
ben affliged / all this nethelesse the resoluco^n intrinsque of his courage is
ever reduced to thobeyssau^ce of ye gods and to their deuyne commandments.
the which all thise things reiecte from him he enterprised for tacoomplysshe
after his power:

ANd what will ye sweet fenyce fou^drynge in teeres / ye for any thing that
she may say / do or think can not co^uerte the courage of eneas. she takes
her re^ours to wyshe death. over much noyeth her to live longer in this world

palayces and her chamber arrayed. flees ye light of ye day / flees the sone
and the heuyn shynynge / In her closet hides herse^f sore sighyng making
great sorrow. But yet for to augmente more her sorrow in desperaco^n. thus hid
and making her secret sacrifyces with ye light of the fire bre^nyng and
e^flamed upon her pouldres of frakenceus whereof she decored her oblaco^ns for
to Immole before thawtres of her temples she saw and aperceyued horrible
things that made her fulsore affraied much more than she was to fore / that
is to wite the holy waters dedicate to the sacrfice. became black and obscure
and changed in horrible licoure. And also apperceyued how the good wynes of
sweet odor ordained for the lybacions or washynges of the sacryfices were
converted and turned in spece of blood cruel all deed and almost rotyn.
which for certain was to her a hard thing to behold / whereof agrete
malencolie enuaded then her heart and her wits all enough troubled of the
things precedent / which things she kept clos and shette withynne the shryne
of her sorrowful thought without to notyfye them to any body living / all
were he never so greatly her friend. not oneli to her suster anne that before had
well known all her secret thoughts and other pryue things. among the
which she had a little sacraire of marbell made in manner of a temple in
remenbrau^ce of Sycheus that his brother pygmalyon had pu^te to destruction /
which during the marriage of hem two deed hau^te there full oste / and made it
to be well ornated and hanged with fair tappytes white. and crowned well
rychely with crowns of gold well enameylled and right curiously and proprely
kerued / and of other somptuouse things in great honor and reverence / out
of ye which sacrayre wthin the temple aforsayde: after that this dydo had
utterly submytted and dedicate her self to eneas out of the place of marriage in
brekynge her first feithe promised to sycheus / her seemed that she herd come
there out often some veyces of her said late husband Sycheus him complaining
and blaming her by cries and lamentacyons in right great wepynges and
quarellouse plaintes / and after at even about ye gooyng under of ye son
when ye derk night takes ye lands under her governance / she being all
alone in her sercrete and pryue houses / understood and herd at every owre the
owl. which is a bird fleyng by night ferynge ye light of the day / whereof
the song termyneth in pyetous extermynaco^n which does quake and fereth
thertes of the hereers and constristeth them with a sorrowful mind. whereby it
is said that he is a bird mortalle or otherwise denou^cer of mortalite. And
co^uerseth often in the chircherde upon the temples and symulacres. and in
places that been solitare and pestyle^cious / this bird above declared. came
almost every night upon the temples and hie pynacles of the palayce and cite of
elysse in syngyng of fine manner in great draughtes and of a long brethe his
right sorrowful song / so that right often he moeued of dydo the courage in to
great teres and sobbynges malencolyouse full of trystesses and merueyllouse
thoughts. and of another side come to her remembrance the great justices and
dyuynaco^ns presagyous and aruspycyous unto her told and sometime denou^ced by
the anguryes and prenostycatures of her hard and adverse fortunes. that to her
were frustred / whereof the most part she had well known and approved to have been veritable / that contryste her always to sorrow more than before / After
whiles that she is lieng in her bed wenynge to sleep and take some rest.
horrible dremes and cruel comen to fore her in her mind / that tormente her in
tremoure merueyllous her heart seems sometime that eneas follows her of nyghe.
as all forcened replenysshed with rage and tormented in furoure for to
distroye her and utterly subcombe her in to persecucyon extreme / And after
sees herself left all alone without company. going by long ways dystroied
deserte and vnhabyted as a woman lost vagau^t about the lands unknown to
her / where she goes. After with this dreme comes to her advise that her cite
and lands of Cartage are all dystroied and turned in exyll / wherefore she
flees for doubt to be taken and retourneth toward the march of thyr wenynge
for to come to a place of sauete but suddenly comes tofore her in her
remenbrau^ce the great Iniurye that she has done to the tyrynes / withdrawn
their folk and taken their good and all the rychesses of sycheus / the
which to be had pygmalion king of all the land made him to be slain and
mordred falsely. wherefore she doubts lest asmoche should be done to her if she
went thidre. And thus she remains in this point desolate without any hope of
some refute to have as all turned from herself for great sorrow in to a
rageouse franesye. even thus as was the sone of pantheus cardynus when in his
great furyosite was converted and turned by Acho out of his wit. so that him
seemed that he saw the felawes of the Emmendes and all their excercyte / that
is to wite Thesypho Megere and Atheleto they three furyouse goddesses infernalle

men have made / Clotho and also Latheser that never ceassen to spynne and weue
/ To set to gyder and to coagule all natures for generacyon / Whereof are
produced all the creatures that out of the earth ben heued up to the ayere. Of
another side she saw also to her semynge two sons shynynge one by another
that present hemself by symulacyon within the fantasme of her entendement all
troubled in great confusyon of dysplaysures and sorrows excessyue. all diverse
in contrary qualyte / And ye two thebes great citees merueyllouse that appieren
in aduysion to be before her eyes / which to her semyng are both proprely one
like another / How be it that there was never but one which akyng of greece
called cadinus made sotyme that found first ye lettres and the art of writing
which he sent in to diverse countries. and pryncipally in the land of fenice
where he made scriptures great books and cronicles / learned the folk to read
and to write / whereof right great lawde was to him at tribued to have found by
subtle artyfice such a manner of way that men may do know all his will
and notyfie it to whom he will. by one simple lettre. be it nyghe or far. be
it of peace or of were of amyte. or of any other thing / without to depart
himself from his place but only by a messager which is sent there / which
happily shall know nothing of the matere / and all be he dombe or specheles if
he take the lettre unto him whom it is dyrected unto how be it that he were
at room or in navarre in hongary or in england he shall thereby understand

this owre with a good right and a Just cause is left of the god cadynus here
in earth his great loenge and good reno^m^e that never shall be eytyncted nor
anychiled nor here after abolished. But in token of this that the first lettres
whereof he was inventour. came out of fenyce equypared to purpre color. By
cause that in that country were the pourpre clothes first made and the color
found / We write yet in our kalenders the high festes with read lettres of

Of the words of dydo to her suster nne. Cap^ / xxiij
MY right dear suster and parfite friend: will ye reioysshe my courage to the
reco^fort of my sorrows and bitterness. Verily I have inquired if it were not
possible for to find somwaye to pease and make sweet the great euylles whereof
I am esprysed and to depart myself without heaviness from the great love that I
have to eneas. or to make him to remeue and return toward me without tarynge.
and so much I have done by my dilygent inquisico^n / that I have fo^nde a
thing right merueyllouse / It is truth my sweet suster that about the
lymytes of the great see that men call occeane in the marches or the son
going under right nyghe to ye place where he lies at the ends upon his last
part of therth there habitable where co^uerse thethyopes is a certain co^tr^ of
habitaco^n merueyllouse where as men sayen the great athlas yt susteyneth upon
his sholders thaxtre of ye moeuyng of theuen with his sterris bre^nynge that
makes him to moeue and turn to what side that he will / makes his princypall
duellynge. In this place then whereof I tell you. as I have be advertised. is
a right holy woman which is a prestresse and wardeyne of the fair temples of
the Operydes which are the daughters of athlas / she is theirt maistres their
tutryce and techer that lerneth and enterteyned hem / and incyteth and techeth
them for to do sacrifice to ye goddess / and for her great wit and knowing
and al so for her great science that be knitte togider with ye experience ye
she has within her of all things / was taken unto her ye cure and government
of ye tendynge and of the norryture of ye fires dragon that had that time the
keeping of the holy branches of the tree with golden fruit that bare apples all
of gold / and prepared to him his mete all after his complexion sometime wete
things humyde when he was wexed lene for to have him soon up again* Another
time powdres and graynes of poppy and other seeds. for to make him soon a
sleep when he was ouermoche traueylled / and admynystred to him his metes after
that he was dysposed / This lady knows many things / and emonge other will
undertake and promytteth by her sorts and charms to deliver pure and plain
the affections and courages that been bounden and enterlaced in love one toward
an other to them that she is playsed. and has them attones without
prolongaco^n ne taryeng from ye great love merueyllouse. and to the contrary
puts love suddenly in to them that happily thinks not upon. But yet this
is a lityl thing to the regard of the other great artyfices and works that
she can do. as to tarry and areste sodaynli the flodes and great ryuers that
they goo no ferther down. And make their bygge stremes rennyng to remounte
upward. the sterres also and all the fyrmamente she makes to return abacke /
the souls pryuated and low that be descended in to hell constrayneth them
often by night time to speak with her / she makes therthe to call and cry.
when she tredeth upon and sometime tourmenteth it in so diverse manner that she
all to shakes it and pulls out the great trees and makes them to fall
don^e from the mountains by her great wyndes and terryble orages and tempests
yt she draws and sends in to diverse contreys. But I swear to yt my dear
suster germayn by all thy gods and thy head debonayr / that in all thartes
and scyences magicque whereof this lady and prestresse e^tromytreteth hersef / I
would never set my self thereto nor enquere no thing thereof / and this that I
have e^terprysed for to do / it is by great prayer and co^straynt and in my
body defendyng / always since yt I have e^terprised fermly my wits thereunto /
it byhoueth me then^e to do ye all that thereto apparteyneth for to bring
better our work to an end / And because that it is of costume and necessary
to have ever fire without cease I require the my sweet suster and pray that
in some place of my palaice most secret. that men be not aware of it. thou do
agrete fire to be made / And the armures of ye man without pite ye false eneas
for whom I call alas yt ever he was borne / which he has left hanginge in
my chamber with all his habilime^tes and other things his of own left
behi^de in my prive closet^ where I was perisshed and lay many a night he and I
togider. must all be cast in to that great fire for to brenne and convert
them in to ashes / as does tell and commands that woman of great science
/ that men must do perish and oblishe distroye and take all out of memory
all yt is abiden behind of that traitor and cruel approved

Hw dydo in great bewayllynges prayed her suster to make a great fire in a
place most secret of her palayce for to bre^ne the harneys and rayme^tes of
Eneas / and bow by diverse sorts she wend to have dystroyed him. Capitulo
xxiiij
AFter yt which things dydo kept herself still without any words more to
speak all pale and discolored as a body yt is taken out of ye earth or fro some
great and sudden peril whereof anne her suster was much abashed / always she
doubted her self in no wise yt her suster would entende to do a new
sacryfice yt before yt time had never be done / yt is to sacryfye her self with
funerailles mortalle by fire horrible and knew not yt she was accensed nor
esprised in her courage of so great afurour nor yt her sorrow had be wers / than
was that: that she suffered at the death of her late husbonde Sycheus. And

logges and under him and round about great foison of dry fagottes and other
small wood for to kendle the fire lightly / and took herself for to encence it
and to susfou^ge the place / And crowned it with garlandes made of herbs and
branches that men have of costume to put upon the corces of the deed bodies
upon their graves and tombs and also over the image and figure of eneas that
she had do make after the femblaunce of him for to be burnt there with her.

oblacions and other things necessayre and conuenable to this present obsequye
And then came out the old witch of charmouse magyque in her raymentes made
in diverse maneres all her head shaven for to fuldoo her sacrifyces / At the
beginning of which she inuoqued and called three times by hidous words three
hundred gods infernal / and the great habitacyon of hell sempyternalle wych
their confusion / the mother of magyque in her triple proporcyon. and the three
faces of the moon that shyneth by the quarfours sometime with two great horns
and sometime as it were cut by the mids / Another time she appyereth all

the which if they knew them they should not happily merueylle. Also from
within it is obscured much more in some places than in some other. So that men
might say that it encloseth that it is the tryple figure of the vierge dyane.
whereof makes her Inuocacion this lady old magicienne / And thus dooynge she
did asperse the place with the waters obscure venemouse and blak representyng
the lycoure of the hydous fontaynes of hell / After she makes to be brought
to her certain herbs fresh and new mowen and taken by night when the moon
shyneth with sercles of coper whereof the Iuse is passing venymouse and of
color all blake And with this she takes the little skin that remains of
the secondyne within the forhed of the little fool that must be scraped away
from his forhed when he is newly borne before that the mother lycketh it of /
whereof after that done he shall not be known of his said mother / as it is
said. so that she refuses to give him souke / as it were not her own / And
also it is named and called the skin mortalle love. by cause that after the
said prestresse. the fool shall never have lust to souke his mother but if she
likes or eteth the secondying or at lest that same skin that he has in

Of the vysion that Eneas had for to depart toward ytalye Capitulum xxvi
THis lady when she did remember the forsweryng of laomedon of whom the
trojans are descended made great doubt to follow them / and stryuyng with in

what may I do now / ought I to leave all the fenyces and them that I have
wythdrawen from thyr for to goo with the trojans. or that by puyssau^ce and by
my hand strongly armed / I should geo to destroy their nauye. and bring them
to perdycyon. without fawte I wot not what to say. and me seems to hard a
thing for to habandou^e my good subgettes which by well subtyl means and
great dif^^culte I have brought out of thyr and out of the land of fenyce. to
expose and bring them now sone in dangers of the sea and to the hard peril
of battle / namly ayenste them of Troy / whom they have no quarelle / Verily
when I me aduy / seit is better that I deye as I have well deserved. And that

done my sweet suster germayne of my teeres and emense wepynges / you have ben
the first cause of the great furoure where I am now in / you have charged upon
my sholdres all the great euylles yt I bear and supporte. thou haste absorbed
me and reclosed in the great see of amarytude / you haste found me well
pesible. but thou have betaken me for to werre against mine own peace. you have
brought me from solysitude and remysed into resolysitude you have taken rest
fro me and have brought me in to right great turbaco^n / thou have abolysshed
my frau^chise for to enter in to great seruytude. thou have dyuerted my honor
in to dishonest infamye / you have converted my cite in fe^re and dread
perdurable thou have all puerted my wits and reduced in to madness and
forsenerie / thou haste deliuerde me my traitor and perverse enmye under hope
of love and benyuolence. what eyleth me tryst pour / weri and full of tee^ys.
O fortune evil fortuned / why haste you not permytted me and suffered. that
without forfayte or any crime / I might have used the residue of my dolau^t life
chastely alone without company of man. as the bestes in the forestes do lie
as it apiereth full of ten all alone by them self. If thus I had mayntened
myself / I should never have come ne fall in ye sorrows and displaysures /
co^playntes and clamours where I am now in all doled and of great furour
forsened / more than ever was woman of mother borne / unto this time present

subtylle in all her deeds / As says the fable / A great danger is then to

Capitulum xxvijo.
ANd then eneas all affrayed of his great vysion. awaked suddenly from his

to hale up the saylles. and the other for to draw thancres / and made them to
take their oores in hand. recou^tynge and showing unto them all theffecte of
his vysion / and how and by what rayson the great god of heaven commanded him
by his messager that he must depart right soon / And for to have them yet
more / he admonested them of new for to sprede and dysploye the sails and
cords yt were within the ships and to make soon ready all thappareylle and
all that neded then^e for to depart inco^tynent / always reco^mendyng
himself and all his / to this great god of majesty that had thus incyted and

habilime^tes / the bed and other remenau^t. yt by other times before had plaised
her so much / and then she began somewhat for to lacryme and syghe upon the
bed where she put herself inproferryng her last words in this manner: O right
sweet dispoillynges plaisau^t well loved and honored of me sometime aslo^ge as
god and fortune would. I beseech you take my soul and delyuere her out of this

the image of my semblaunce be sent under the earth / I have had of peynes and
traueylles by my brother pygmalyon that made to deye cruelly my first husband

have edified my cite fair noble puissaunt and rich I have seen the walls and

should be well happy and above all other honored well loved and holden fulle

great dispite. that has brought me in to confusion / O tryste machynacyon of

ashamefull death which shall come to me suddenly and presently without

thus falsely without to be avenged of that traitor theffe and cruel by whom I
am vitupered so sore and defiled Now then since it is so I will soon deye
hastly and send my ghost suddenly unto the low shadows / I should deye more
gladly if Eneas were here present for to see the death and great tourment that
for him I must endure. to the end that he were thereof contryste in remembrance
pardurable aslong as that his lyffe shall last and sith that otherwise it can

Hw dydo full of great rage and dyspourueyed of wit slew herself with the

THe which things thus made and said without any more langage / dydo full of
rage seized then the sword of eneas which she held the point upward and
upon hit deed cast her self so that the sword entered within her breast unto the

this sorrowful lady found on the gronude that could not rise her hands and
her person all covered and defiled with blood without mesure and the sword
that dropped yet of blood and all blody lay by her. whereof a great sorrow a
great cry and great clamor was then attones suddenly made thrughe all the
palayce that perced the walls and tours unto the mids of the town / there
should ye have seen make great lamentacyons great cries / great playntes and
great moon wymen weep sighe and making sorrow and all ye people was all

such wise and form as though ye enmyes capitalle of the town had entered by
force of arms within the same for to bring them all to destruction. or as
that the great and ancient town of thyr that has nourysshed them. and the

in this wise / My right sweet suster alas what haste thou do / and by what
manner and rayson have you brought thy self thus to eternal perdycyon / and
have deceived me wyckedly and. falsely with a bitter death which I would gladly
have suffered and endured with the / Alas what need was it to me to make ready
the sacrifyces fyth that a fire for all other obsequyes and a sword well
sharp slyped might have brought the two susters to death both ardnes without
to have be departed one from the othre. Alas what shall I say. ne what

has falsely done. not only to me / but has defiled vylaynsly the good name
and the enhau^synge of the cytee that she has cou^mysed and submysed to a
great vilete and shame. for all times shall be recyted the enormyte of this
fowlle befalle which ever shall be imputed to a great infamye whereof they of
cartage shall have a blame yt shall torn unto them to a great diffamye. And
much more because of their good fame that was known / that had be well
entreteyned and in great worshp sustained / if my suster had mayntened and kept
herself without dysperacyon / Whereof all hope / as well to them as to me
failleth by her yt has exty^cted our good renommee and brought us in a great
blame and now be we without pastoure. as the sheep that is habau^dou^ed Now
then. since that it is thus come / let us look to her wound and in her face
if she is thrughly passed / and then she took her up between her arms and
with right great sorrow and heaviness / washed the blood away from about the
sore and made it clean fulle swetly with her own raymentes / And perceived and
knew that yet some spyryte of lyffe was wythyn the persoune of Dydo that
forced her self for to open her eyes / And three times made her effort to reyse
her self upon her elbowe. But her strengthes sorefa ylled of the death that
already had her all in her rewle might not thereto suffyse but that she must
fall again attones upon her bed where she had be laid / And knowing that
she wasted all away. she did forse her own self for to open her eyes / to
see the light of the day. that gryeued her sorrow well hard and sharply and
by such a wy^e that she entered incontynente in great pain to the extreme
angwysshe of the death where she was right long / Whereof Juno the noble
goddess conseruatyue of yongthe that had pity of the long sorrow mortalle
in which was constytuted the fair Elysse or dydo / sent toward her for to
bring at an end her Immense trystesse her noble messager named Yris /
which as some saen is the rayen bow with her fair cote of diverse fygures For
to unbind the rotes of the spyrite vytalle from the membrees of her body.
Which were then in great opposicyon and debate one ayenste another / By
cause that the humydyte radycalle. and other complexcyons in proporcyon
conuenable coenclyued together. Did receive the gooste so that it could not
goo there from by hit self without aid of other / Also that her death
naturalle ought not to haven comen yet of long time / But by accydente and
hard^ fortune / which is gladdely evil and diverse to them that she
byholdeth awrye. was brought in to such dysperacyon / not for no crymynalle
cause. not for noon other thing whereof she ought^ to suffer death / nor to
endure any pain or sufferaunce / that she slew her self And then after that
arose proserpyne wyffe and spouse to Pluto the right great god infernalle
which holds under her domynacyon the persons that be Inueterate of evil
days / And they that been in great sorrows to whom she admynystred all the
deturpacyons and the hardenesse of old age / as to some while that they be
slepynge / she sets white herres on the ground of their hedes. Some she
makes scabbed and full of ytche. the feet to be great and swollen / And
then the gowte or the poplesie. the stytches or the paralesye. The debylyte
or feebleness / and of the eyes appayreth the sight and replenysseth them all
with teeres / and the lyddes of the eyes with fylthe. so that when they rise
in the morning they must be washed with wine or with some other lauatorye /
And to other she makes their memory to wexe feeble and conuerteth it in to
ygnoraunce. She takes from them the puyssaunce that they had first and has
away fro them furtyuely by process of time all their strengthes one after
another by cause noon shall be aware of her for doubt that she be not
deceived. And after she makes them crooked and boweth their bodies. hanging
their hedes to the ground ward all full of care and as coun^refete as well
the men as the wymmen / to the which for to bear to them a dyffame / takes
their fair color away. and makes them as pale as ashes / To other she
gives rednes with a high color over excessyue and dyshonneste. and the
yelowe here is of their heddes she makes them to book like rousset / or like
the color of an old bear / She after shorteth their retentyue brethe. and
molyfyeth in them all their blood: And noon otherwise it is to be supposed.
but that she does in like wise of all the remenaunte / For she goes ledynge
all in equal proporcyon. and makes them dystrybucyon by the temples and in
the face of great ryueles and fromples that put out the beaulte of the
playsaunte vysage that she shows all with cordage aswelle in the nek as
about the temples / We have thereof many exemples / No More thereof we will now
speak / It is so lothely to here / Also well hard it is to me to tell thereof
that I have said before / but to the end that any gaynsaynge should be Imputed
against me / to have obmyssed for to dyscute some of the condycyons and evil
operacyons of the cursed proserpyne that is more sore pryckynge than the thorn
/ I have set thees here for to understand the other better that men shall
mow take In like conformyte as it is recyted above /

Of the beaulte of dydo Capitulum / xxix
THis proserpyne of whom I speak / how be it that of all her works and
subtylle artyfyces whereof she is wont to use had not in no wise wrought for
dydo nor hade not yet enprynted in her person any sign of old age. nor other
thing whereby she should directely have pretended upon her any right. Always
she would force her self to have for her part the soul of Elysse / saying.
that she had^e slain herself by dysperacion as for cause of furye and of rage
which is a thing Inhumayne dependynge of the operacyons and wodnesses of
hell that she herself has enprynted in her person. Whereunto she has
subdued and submytted herself. Wherefore by reason she ought to abide under her
/ as we see by example famyler when some body has submytted himself by
oblygacion to the iurisdicyon of some Judge the said judge is capable for to
have the knowledge thereof how be it that to fore the oblygacyon was made / the
person was exempt of his Iurisdicyon. And aftre thees raysons and othre that
were to long to be recou^ted proserpyne said that elysse ought to abide with
her as she that had submyted her self to her laws and Iurysdyctions / But the
fair Iris that departed from heuene by the commandment of the goddess Juno
descendynge by the clouds with her gylte feders at the oposyte of the son
ornated with a thousaunde colors / Came and set her self upon the head of
Dydo / And for an answer to the adlegacyons of Proserpyne. said to her thees
things / This is of rayson wryton when any person noble is in debate between
two parties that the most parent heir of the lynage and that comes of
lawefulle issue shall be proserred before that other party. and shall bear the
name away with him namely when he is of the first issue / And also that he
has the gretter part in the heritage and has done many aquysycions
amendynges and reparacyons / Now it is so that the goddess Juno whose right
for to deffende and keep I am sent hither / has produced in her being in
this possessions / that is to wit Elysse whereof we understand betwix us two /
And has made her to be borne has brought her to the world and has
alymented and noryshed her from the owre of her birthe unto this time present /
And has given unto her so many fair yestes of nature / As is beaulte
corporelle / yongthe well made of her members each in his qualyte and right
egall in proporcyon without any dyfformyte / the head well set by mesure upon
the nek fair herys and long yelowe tresses. hangyng between two sholders to

accomplished ye nature had produced sith her beginning unto that time. Wherefore
then since that thou proserpyne can not show noon other rayson but the said
submission whereof thou have spoken here before I say for to keep equity / that
there was some deceptyon or frawdulent induction that has made her to
condescende thereunto as men may manyfestly apperceyue by the premysses a boue

assoylled well and deffended may well have releuement / But a another way I

will renounce all the right that thou pretendest upon her Wherefore then
Yrys made the fair herys of dydo to be cut and took them to proserpyne And
then she took up on her self for to unbind the members from the spyrite of
lyffe whereof the hete was soon extyncted and was anon rauyshed with the
wyndes that bare her away a great pas and delivered her free and quytte to

WHat shall I more say of the queen dydo nor of her sorrow that she made nor
also of the great moon yt her folk made for her after that she was deed / But
now I shall tell of Eneas yt went in to Italye for to have the land that ye
gods had promised unto him / when then they had ro^ne and saylled so much
yt they were in the high see / a strong weddre arose that brought to them
agrete tempeste so that they wist not what they should do nor say and
habau^douned their saylles for to bear their ships at ye will of ye
horrible wyndes in whose power they were ye master maryner said after his
semynge by ye sterres yt he saw that they made way toward Cecylle. whereof
Accestes was king / When Eneas herd thus speak the maryner. he was thereof
glad / and said. that to noone other land he would more gladdely goo. if the
goddess would For Accestes was his friend. and of the lygnage of the Trojans.
And also the sepulture of his fader Anchises was there / Soon after ceased
the tempeste / and they saylled so long that they arrived in Accestes land /
that had great Joy when he knew of their coming / And soon after that
they were entered in to the haven / Accestes right gladdely received them with
great Joy / When the morn come. Eneas spoke to Accestes the king of the
land / and to his barons / and said to them in this wise / That the
annyuersarye of his fader he would make and that he was right glad that he
was come there so sone / And that he wyste well that hit was the will of the
gods / Then ordained and aduysed Accestes and Eneas for to make plays of
diverse manners abowte the tomb of Anchyses / Wherefore the young bachelors
showed there their prowess. Turned their horses. and ran and lepte / and
proved them self one ageynste another / And at this annyuersarye that Eneas
did do make for his fader / was made much of prowess For all they that
were there did put hemselfe in pain for to do well. as well Eneas folk as
they of Accestes

How Eneas took the sea for to seek the regyon of Ytalye: Capitulum xxxjo.
When they were comen again from ye sepulture of anchises their ships were set
in a fire and had been all bre^t if it had not be a messager yt anou^ced this to
them there as they were / And said / that the ladies that were within the
ships had set them In a fire / Because they would feign make there their
dwelling place for they had been seven year and more out of their countreye
and were sore weary and broken of their long vyage When they understood these
tidings Ascanyus that was set upon a rich courser went with other in his
company and rescued the ships with great pain / but all ways there were
three of theyme lost and burnt / After this was done Eneas was conuseylled
that he should begin to bylde there a new cytee which he should people with
the folk that were comen with him that were not able to bear arms nor for to
goo to bataylle / And thus he deed it by the will of Accestes / And devised
the gretenes of the cytee and said that it should be called the new troy /
But they of the country named her aftrewarde Accestre for the worshype of
Accestes by whom all the land was governed In the same cytee left Eneas the
wymmen and the children and the old men / and helped himself with thoos that
were strong and that might well endure the traueylles of bataylle for to
ha^ue them with him In Italye / A few men he had but they were good and
socourable both by see and by the land / when this was done and that Eneas
had do make the tomb of his fader / He took his leave of the king and of
his own folk that he lest behind for to enhabyte there that made great
sorrow for his departing / Then returned Eneas with his folk that should
goo with him In to Italye and entered his ships that were well appareylled And
made the saylles to be hyssed up. took up their ancres / and departed from
the rode. Then might ye have seen the ladies and other weep full sore /
making great moon for their friends and their children that they saw depart
from them. Eneas went streyghte / toward ytaly / but one thing hapred evil
to them / For their chyeff maryner. that upon a night was half a sleep upon
the forcastell / fell down in to the sea. and was drowned. whereof Eneas was
full sorry. and all his folk also / And soon after they landed in an isle
which is called Tulyola where was a cite that was named Thetys after Thetys
the neuewe of Eneas that gatte hit / and peopled it after that he had
conquered all Ytalye I have brought this cite to memory. by cause that many
have hard speak of Dedalus that fleded there for fere of the king Mynos of
Crete that would slay him I shall tell you the cause why and shall leave
awhybe to speak of Eneas / The wyffe of king Mynos of Crete was named Pasyfa
that was a great lady and a fair above all other ladies of the royame /
Dedalus dwelled that time in Crete / and was a wise man called and a good man
of werre. The queen Pasyfa was with child by king Mynos / and when her time
was comen she was delivered of a creature that was half a man and half a
bulle. which was called Mynothaurus / and was norysshed by the commandment
of the king that wend hit had be his sone. And became so terryble that the
king was counseylled for to shytte him up some where in a strong hold / And
for this cause was dedalus sent for to the king Mynos / by whose request and
co^maun^ment. this dedalus devised and made a house of merueyllouse composicyon
where were as many walls as were there chambres that were in great nombre. and
every chamber was walled and closed round about. and yet might one goo from
one to a another. And if some body had be shette therein / he could never find
the first entree thereof for to come out again. For an hundred doors were
there. and whosomeuer went in. after he was ones paste the first door he
might never come out again / and wist not where he was. Within this place was
Mynotaurus brought / They of Athenes must send eueri year for a trybute to
the king Mynos of Crete as to their sovereign lord seven men and seven wymen
/ under the age of xxv. years / And when this foureten persons were come to
Crete / the king made them to be put within the foresaid house with his
monstre that devoured them full soon / Egeus was at that time king of
Athenes which was sore an angered in his heart of such a seruage / And by
cause he might not amend hit / he went and sought after an answer to the
temple of Mynerue / for to know what he should do of this thing The goddess
Mynerue gaaffe him answer / that he should send his sone Theseus in to
thraldom to the king of Crete. This Theseus was a fair knight / preu.
valiant / and hardy / And said to his fader that he should goo there / Sith
that the gods were so playsed he then made him ready and took his way /
And when he took his leave of his fader / he commanded to him that he should
bear white saylles in his ship. if he happed to return sauffe without
pereille / In sign of vyctorye.

And theseus said he should do so. if the gods would being him ayenne
alive. king Mynos had a daughter that was called Adryane / which when she
saw Theseus that was so fair and so amyable and that was come for to be in
thraldom under her fader / she had pity of him / and for his honneste
behauoure / Began to be taken with his love / And unto him upon a day she
said / that if he would bring her in to his countreye with him / She should
soon delyuere him from the hands of her fader Mynos / Theseus made this
covenant with her and promysede her for to keep it truly and well / The lady
went anon to Dedalus and required and asked him how she mygtht delyuere
Theseus / Dedalus told her / that theseus should meddle pyche and towe both
together and that he should bear the same with him / And when he should come
before the monstre he should cast it before him which anoon should come for to
ete it. But he should never conne chewe it so much that he should not swalowe
hit nor have it out of his mouth / And whiles that the monstre were thus besy
and sore occupied / theseus might slay him lightly / And when he shall come to
the first door of the house he must take with him a botom of threde and the
end of hit. he shall make fast to the first door and so goo forth wyndynge
of this botom of threde till he be come to his above of his entrepryse. And by
the threde that he shall wind up to gyder he shall mow return lightly to
the first door where he went ynne / Thus did Theseus by the counseylle of the
lady and slew the monstre and came again out of the place full soon / And
anon after he took Adryane with him. and secretly entered in to his ship /
and made as good way as the wyndes would / without the knowleche of Mynos
the king / Theseus was so glad of this good te adventure that was happed to
him) that he forgate for to do as his fader had commanded him at his
departing from Athenes / that if he escaped he should set up white sails.
and if he were perisshed his men should come home again berynge black saylles /
and thus he should be in certain of his lyffe or of his death:

How king Egeus let fall him self in to the sea for ye death of his sone
Theseus. Capitulum xxxijo.
When Egeus saw the ship of his sone coming again with ye black saylle spread
abroad / like as wha^ he departed from him / he wend verily that he had be
ded / And for great sorrow that he had / did cast himself out of the
wyndowes of his castle in to the sea and lost his life in this wise. And when
king Mynos wist that Theseus was escaped by dedalus / he put him in prison and
his sone with him / But Dedalus made wings and fastened them to his arms.
and to his sons arms of federes of pytche and of wex connyngly made / and
floughe out at the wyndowes fro the prison where they were. But sycarus the
sone of dedalus floughe all to high whereby the wax wexed hoote and began to
melte. and the feders to fall of. wherefore he fell down in to the sea. and
was drowned but his fader floughe so long* as Salamon tells. that he came
in to the isle of Sardayne. and after went he to Thebes And all thus eschaped
dedalus out of the prison of Mynos king of Crete / Now shall I leave to speak
of this matter and shall tell of Eneas and of his works

How Eneas arrived in Ytalye Capitulu^ xxxiij
When Eeneas and his folk were arrived in the said isle of Enlyola they landed
anon / And eneas went to a forest where was a rich temple that dedalus had
founded there / In to this temple went Eneas / and there he would rest him
self awhyle There dwelled the goddess Cryspyne which should have brought
eneas in to hell for to see the soul of Anchises his fadre / and the sowles
of all his meynee that were decessed / but this matter I leave for it is feigned
and not to be byleuyd / who that will know how eneas went to hell late him
read virgyle claudyan or the pistelles of Ouyde. and there he shall find more
than truth. For which cause I leave it and write not of it. When Eneas had
taken his rest there awhile / he and his folk departed from thens / And went
so much that they came in ytalye in a great forest where the river of the
tonyre renneth and falls there in to the sea then co^manuded eneas his
maryners that they should set him alon^e there and all his folk / and they
did somoche that they came and entered wthin the hauene. for they saw the
country fair and delectable. and the forest great and full of bestes / Of
this land was lord king latynus that had noon heir but afayre daughter that
was named lauyne / The king latyne her fader was of great age / and many one
had required his daughter to be their spouse. And among other a bacheler of
ytalie should have had her which was called turnus yt was much preu and hardy
/ but king latyne would not give her to him though the pucelle was in age able
to be married to a prince of a land /

Here It is showed how many kings had been In ytalye before that eneas came there
first Capitulum xxxiiij
Before that Eneas was come in to ytalye there had be seven kings that
successyuely had kept the land The first was Lanus which. did enhabyte
there first and peopled the contree / and after him Saturnus / but this was
not the fader of Iupyter of whom the auctours speken. After saturnus was Pyrrus
king of this land. after him came Famus / and after him his sone Latynus that
then was a live. and kept the royame. There reygne lasted a hundred and
fyfty years / before that Eneas wedded Lauyne by whom he had the royame / And
after them reigned eneas in ytalye / and they that issued of him four hundred
and seven years. unto romulus time / and then seven kings reigned there
after him / that is to white. Pympeyns. Iulyus us hostylius / Marcus ancus /
Pryscus tarquynus / Suluyus / Tullyus. Lucyus / these kings reigned two
hundred and xlo. years / unto Brutus that first was made consulle of the land
/ And fro brutus and them that after him reigned. unto Iulyus cesare that was
the first emperor. was v. hundred and iiij years Now will I tell of eneas
and of his folk and that as soon as that they were come a land / they set
hemselfe at dinner and made trenchers of bread for to put their mete upon /
For they had another dysshes ne trenchers / and at last they had so little
bread that they ete all their trenchers. and all that was left / And when
ascanyus saw this. he began to lawgh / And soon when eneas vndrestode it / he
wyste well that he was come in to the contre that the gods had promised to
him / For his fader had told him in a vysion that where he should hap to
ete the releef or brokelyngrs of his board. there should be his dwelling place
/ Eneas had this thing sore fast in his mind. And when he saw that this
was so fallen / he was right glad in his courage / and said to his folk that
he wyste well for certain that they were in the royame that the gods had
promised unto them. and that their traueyll should be fynysshed there. Then
they made great Joy together. and broughtte out their gods from the ships
that they had brought with them out of Troy. and to them they made
sacryfices. and their orysons and prayers. that they would help them Then
demanded Eeneas of some folk that he met by the way who kept the country /
and who was lord thereof / And they told him the king Latyne that was sore
auncyente and had no children but a daughter / and that dwelled not far
from thens. that is to wit at Lawrence:

How Eneas bygan to build his fortress upon the Tonyre Capitulum xxxv
NOw shall I tell you why this cite was called Laurence. for she was first
named Lamyna / king Latynus had a brother that was called Lauynus that
sounded the same cite. and said that after his name she should be called lamyna
/ and when he was ded / the cite apparteyned to king latyne / that made it
more strong than it was a fore. and was always called Lamyna. till that it
happed that a laurel tree grew there upon a high toure within the cite* And
thereof it fortuned that king latyne did call this town Laurence / which he
loved right much For it was the chief cite of all his royame. when eneas
understood that the cite where the king of the land dwelling was so nyghe /
and that this cite was so noble / and so well peopled. he was right glad
thereof. And after he looked abowte him where a place was most strong and there
he brought all his ooste / and round about this place he did make diches
and barreys for to defend hemselfe if need were / And for certain within a
lityll space of time they made the place so strong that they doubted no body
that could hurt them: nor take them vnbeware

How Eneas sent his messagers toward king Latyne: Capitulum xxxvij
When Eneas had begone his fortress / he called to him a hundred of the
wysest men that were in his ooste / for to send them toward king Latynus in
his cite of Laurence for to require him of peace and of alyaunce. and that he
was not arrived in his land for to do to him nor to the country any do^mage /
but besoughte him that he would not let him of that he had enterprysed to
make a castle upon his ground that was bego^ne / For he made this for to rest
him and his folk / and for to dwell within his royame by the commau^demente
of the gods without to do him any hurt nor greuaunce. The messagers went
so long with their rich present that they bare from Eneas / to king Latynus
and with garlandes upon their hedes made of olyue tree / and also in their
hands branches of the same / that peace and love sygnyfieth / that they came
to the cite of Laurence. where they fond alityll without the town a great
feast of young men / that proved and assayed their streyngthes in diverse wyses
/ Then entered ye trojans within the yates of the town / and one of the
Iouencellys that thus did sport him self there went a pase before them. and
came and showed to king latyne / how that a company of noble men / and to his
semyng of right high astate / were entered within his cite. for to come speak
with him / and yt they seemed well to be rich and pesable folk / for they bare
branches of olyue tree in their hands / the king commanded anon when he
knew of it / yt they should be brought unto him / And so it was done / The
messagers come before the king Latyne to whom they made reverence prudently
and him did salve in their lords byhalue / The king that satte high in his
throne withyn his halle where as were purtrayed fulle rychely all the kings
of his lynage connyngly made. how they had kept ytalye one after another /
with the adventures that were come to them and the great bataylles that they
had made. Answered well peasibly to the troyens / For already he had well
understand that they were of troy that was all distroied / and asked them
what they sought and what need had brought them in to the land of Lombardye /
whether the tempeste had chassed them / or if they had lost their way /
For in many manners comen pain and traneylle often upon / but how so ever ye be
arrived and comen hither since that ye require peace ye be right welcomen to me.
The land is good and fair and the country sweet and delectable / And well ye
may ease your self therynne / and also right and rayson requires that ye do
so / For dardanus that first kept the regne of troy was of this country
borne / Then gaffe the king seassyng to his words / And dyoneus one of the
troyens that were there began to speak / saying In this wise / Gentylle king
and of high lynage and puyssaunt prince / Thou shalt understand well that
none strong wedrynge ne tempeste / has constrained us for to comme In to
this land. but we are comme hither with our good will / For we ben departed
from the rich cytee of troy / That of lordeshyppe surmou^ted all other
cytees that were In her time. And after the destruccyon of the same that was
so great as / thou haste well herd tell. We departed fro thens and have had
sith so much of pain both by see and by land that long after we had
left and habandouned our own contree / we were commanded of the gods that
we should come in to these parties for to have therein our residence / And we
require only to have a lityll plotte of ground where we may dwell in peace /
and no hurt damage ne greuau^ce shall not be done to the of us by no manner of
wise / And ye must know that we might have be received in many places and in
a good country for to make there our dwelling / But the destynacyes of the
gods. sent us in to thy reygne for to have our permanente residence there /
as Dardanus was borne. And appollo commanded us the same / and for this thing
said Dyoneus we are arrived in this land / And also Eneas that is our king
sends unto the of his Iewelles that he has brought with him out of troy.
where he was in great honor. and a prince of great lordeshyppes. And then he
took to the king a rich mau^telle and a crown of fine gold all set with
precyouse stones and a cepter royal that king pryamus did bear often in his
hand How king Latynus made great joy and good chere to ye messagers of eneas:
Capo. xxxvij

THe king latynus received the rich present. and dydneus held his peace / and
the king latyne praised much the trojans. not for the present that eneas had
sent to him. but for love of the marriage of his daughter / And why he did so.
it was for because that he had granted his daughter to a worshifull knight
that was called Turnus the sone of king Darynus of the cite of Darda / that
was not far from Laurence / To him he had couenaunced his daughter Lauyne /
but theropon he had an answer of y^ gods. that he should not give her to him
/ but he should give her unto a knight stranger. And when king Latyne had
mused alytyll in him self / he ansuered to the message. Fair brother the
gyste that thou have brought to me from thy lords byhalue I shall not refuse
/ but I receive it gladly / and so tell him that I am right glad of his
coming and that my land which is good / Is at his will. and if yt
playseth to him he may herberrowe himself with me within this cytee / And also
ye shall* tell him that I have a daughter which the gods deffende me that
I shall not give her to no man of this countreye and will that I give her to
astranger of whom shall come a roayalle lygnee and of great name thrughe all
the world. and but I be deceived. It most be he.

How king Latyne sent his presents to Eenas / Capitulum xxxviij.
When the king latyne had thus spoken / he made to be brought before him a
honderd fair horses well rychely enharnyshed and nobly arrayed / and to every
messager troyen he gaffe one of this horses / and sent to Eneas a rich chare
all appareylled for to fight In a bataylle / Then took the messagers there
leave of the king latyne after that he had made them good chere and ryally
fested. and came all again glad and Ioyouse to their lord / And recounted
to him altogyder as it was said and done / Whereof eneas was right glad and
made great Joy / The tidings were spread all about the land of lombardye
and was annou^ced unto Turnus that the troyens that were escaped out of Troy
were aryued in that land and had a lord that was called Eneas / To whom
king Latyne had habaundouned all his land and also his daughter that
Turnus should have by marriage / But the king would give her to the trojans for
to enheryte his royame of the lynce of troy / And that king Latyne had all
ready consented to them for to build and set a castle upon the river of
Tonyre / so that they should not be cast out lightly from the royame by
force. As Soon as Turnus wyste of these tidings. he was sore an angered in his
heart. And was ouermoche wroth for the damoysell that had be granted and
given first of all unto him / And well he swore that Eneas should never have
her as long as he were man on live. Turnus by the counceyll of his fader sent
for his nyghe friends and kynnesmen. for to have counsel upon this thing /
And when he had assembled them together. they did counseyll him that he should
goo toward king Latyne at lawrence and toward the queen / for to know whi
they would give their daughter to a another. contrary to their promise that they
had made to him. During that these words ran / Eneas and his people
wroughte stylle to make up their fortress / And ascanyus by the license of
eneas his fader went to the foreste that was nyghe by Lawrence and diverse of
his knights with him. for to hunte the wild bestes / Turnus had two sons
and a fair daughter. which was named Syluya. this siluya had norisshed a heart
till that he was onergrowen and great. that her brethren had brought to her
from the foreste / so young they had take him away fro the mother. This heart
was so tame yt he suffered well that the damoiselle laid her hand over him
for to make him fair and even / and that she should make him a garlonde about
his horns. he was well fed and much loved of her / and also of Turnus her
brother. And when that this heart had be long at home. he went in to the
forest among the other / and came again at even. The hounds of Ascanyus found
this heart and hunted him sore till that Ascanyus had espied him and shot
an arowe at him and rought the sides of him. This heart all thus wounded and
sore hurt came home again as fast as he might there as he was noryshed and cried
and made moan after his manner. Syluya came first there where he was which was
right sorry when she did see the heart that bled sore and was a deynge. Then
caae there turnus that was much an angryd and wroth therefore and found the
wound and blew a horn for to moeue his folk against them that had slain
this heart. And no moo words were made there. But they went toward the forest
all armed where they found the troyens that were come after the heart: And the
churles ran soon upon them with such armures as they had / The troyens
deffended theymself with their bows and with their swerdes. but the most
strength was still with the men of the country / Nevertheless the medlee wexed
so strong that ascanyus killed there the eldest son of Turnus with an arowe.
Then rose there a great cry So that the troiens were of the wors side / And
when Eneas wist of hit in his fortress he came and brought there a great part
of his folk /

How turnus sent for his folk for to chasse and drive Eneas out of his land
/ Capitulum / xxxix
FOr this occasion bigan the bataylle to be great and mortal that was not
apeased anon / There was great effort made and big estoure after that Eneas
was come there / For of that othre part of the bataylle they of Laure^ce came
there and of all the other contrees about that cursed the king Latyne that so
evil folk had received and lodged In his contree / To this sorrow came Turnus
/ and when he saw all the folk of laurence so moeued against the king Latyne
/ he bigan then^e to swear and say that evil shosde come thereof to the king
Latyne and to the troyens for if he had not Lauyne to his wyff he should do
brenne the cite and the palace also / And then he ascryed his folk and all
them of the cite in which were many knights. and said that him self and
them of the cite should issue in bataylle / Then spoke king Latyne to his
folk and to Turnus and told them that against the will of the gods and
without rayson they would fight aienst the troyens / But for thise words /
turnus nor the other would never withdraw them self the king that saw they
would noon other wise do he let them shyfte / and fought till that the even
departed them / Then came again they of the land to laurence / and eneas and
ascanyus went again to their fortress / turnus had sent for his aid in the
centreye all about and made great folk / first of all came to him mescayus of
cusye and causus his sone and brought folk with them. and then came they of
lo^bardye. of to scane and of the ualles of ytalie. besides all thees came there
canulla a maid yt was lady of prouerne and medabus was her fader this
damoyselle brought with her great company of medeus all in arms for to give
socours to turnus yt she loned sore. when she was come to laure^ce she was
greatly looked upon of ye ladies of the cite because that she mayntened herself
like a knight she was strong and hardy more then any other creature /

Hw eneas went to seek socours of ye king eua^der / capo. xl
THus had turnus assembled his folk for to chase eneas and his folk out of
lo^barde / for he would have ye daughter of ye king latyne / eneas had with him
litil aid but of them yt he had brought with him. he took no care nor abashed
him not because yt ye same lord was promised to him for to dwell in hit /
upon a night came to him a vysion that told him that he should goo to seek
help to a king that was called Euander. which was neuewe to king Thalamus of
Archade. This euander slew his fader by exhorting of his mother that vyceta
was called / and for this cause he left archade / and came in to ytalye / and
did so much that he her berowed him self and his folk that came with him
upon the mount palatyne. Upon the tonyre. Where Euander began a lityll cite
that he named Palence / after the name of king Palantyne of Archade that now is
called Rome / this king Euander had a daughter. which was called after the
name of his cite Palencya / and also he had a sone that was pre^ and hardy.
that had to name Palas ye which werred ever ayenste turnus / and the ytalyens
/ Also turnus would never have concord nor peace with this king Euander / Eneas
said then^e to his folk. that he should goo fette socours and help. And
then^e he entered his ships and his felawes with him / And rowed so much that
they came to Palence where king Euander received them with great Joy and
honored much eneas and said to him that he had well known his fader Anchises
/ So long they spoke one to the other that euander said that he should help
eneas and should take to him his sone palas and four thousand men good fyghters
/ Eneas thanked the king right much of the good will that he had to him. And
when the morning came. and that they had concluded together of there befines they
took leave of king euander / and they yt were most in age e^tred in to the
ships / And the other that were strong went by land:

How a great sorrow was made / when Eneas and Palas departed fro palence:
Capitulum xljo.
When time came that they should depart the queen wept sore tendrely and the
king also that called his sone full swetly saying / Ha a fair sone if I were
as young as I was sometime / with great pain I should late the goo without me /
And I promytte the that Turnus should never make so good watch to keep him
self but that I should do to him demmage right great / But old age reteyneth
me here that happeth to him well. Now pray I our gods that of the. they
make us glad / And that I may see the again alive before that I shall
decesse. For I had much lever deye / than to see thy death. And thanne Palas
and Eneas made sacrifyce to the gods and prayed them ye they would be to
them socourable. and this done they took their leave of ye king euander and
walked so long that the night was come and then they herberowed themself

lau^ched them his dart over the walls and went again In the plain field for
to make a turn of great chiualrye. and he and the other eight that were come
with him ascryed them / of the castle with an hie voys / and sore merueylled
that they were of the trojans so coward. that they would not just with so
few a folk as they were / and when he saw that they would not come out of
their castle / He went round about it where he might ride for tosee and
know of what part the place might sonest be take / And whiles that he did
thus. approached the ooste that came toward the fortress / and Turnus
apperceyued the ships that were nyghe the shore for the men to come a land.
whereof he had great Joy. and commanded soon that the ships of the
trojans should be set all in a fire / by cause that they of the castelle
should not flee thyderwarde for to save them self. They did then as turnus
had commanded / and brenned all the ships sauffe some of whom ye cables

true felawe we have be so famylier and have had so good felyship together.
and now ye will undertake this thing without me / ye shall know that
without my company ye shall nowhere goo / They both together went to Ascanyus
and to the other that were in cou^ceylle for to wit whom they might send to

Palence / Also they per ceyued them by their helmes that they had on their
hedes that resplendyshed against the moon / Bolcus then went against them and
called Abide ye. And tell me what ye be and from whens ye comme / They
answerde not but withdrewe theymself toward the forest. And than botcus and his
men spored there horses and chassed them / bull they were already withyn the

self in till a path and was soon goon far from his enmyes And Eryalus entered
in to a thilkke busshe where he found nothre pathe nor no way at all. and
so he could not flee far from his enmyes that chassed him / Vysus that already
was escaped sauf looked behind him and saw not his felawe nor Erialus were.
whereof he was right sore angri. And sore sighynge he began to say. O sweet
felawe where have I lost the. where might I seek the And when he hade said this
he returned again bak that way that he came. And he had not gone long that he
herd the noise of the horses about erialus that his enmyes had taken already.

auaylled him not / visus went so long rennynge till yt he saw his enmyes about

delyuere him from their hands. And when he had aduysed him enough he looked
upon a dart that he held in his hand and threw it with all his strength
and smotte a knight between two sholders therewith all so that the iron went
thrughe the body of him which fell down ded to the grou^nde from his horse

to know fro whom these strokes came / and in a great anger said to eryalus who
ever has done ye same ye peynes thereof shall abide upon ye / and with y^
sword all naked in his fust came nygh him / and would slay him. and when vysus
saw this. he could no longer suffer it by cause yt he would not see his felawe

me to death. For he has forfayte nothing. While that vysus spoke thise words

slain within the tents / When then the day was come / Turnus commanded
that all the ooste should be armed / And that every prince should ordeyne his
folk for to assaylle the castle / And they did so by great wrath / And
then turnus made the hedes of eryalus and Vysus to be smytten of from their
bodies / and set upon two speres. and brought them before the castle with a
great noise and great calling / for to fere and abasshe the trojans therwyth.

blew up their trompettes for to give a sharp sawte / And tarried not. but did
hie them for to fylle the dyches / and for to dress up the ladders ayenste
the walls / And they that were there upon the walls brake their sheldes and
their pauesses / And the hardy knights trojans that had learned for to defend

stones. They that came first to assawte the place might not suffer no longer
the strength of the trojans that were upon the walls of their fortress. For
they brake their sheldys and helmes and their li^mes and all to burst their

then so feeble: and does my sword cut so lityll / that I dare not fight
with Eneas. and is my flesh more tender and the blood of my body more nyghe
goon / more than is his / And I do him well to wit that if he come so nyghe
me that he be wounded / he shall be far from ye goddess his mother / to whom
he trust much if I fight with him: To thise words came there the queen Amatha
that was sore troubled. and all a ferde of the bataylle and of the siege of the
cite. And when she saw turnus that would fight with eneas. she began to
weep and make great moan and said / Turnus I pray the by the teeres that thou
seeste fall fro mine eyes / and by the honor that I have always borne and
done to the. that thou fight not with Eneas / For if thou deyed I should never
live after night ne day. For that owre I would never see that eneas shield
have my daughter to his wyffe / When Lauyne saw her mother weep she was thereof
fulle sorry and wroth and with this she be came read In her face / And when
Turnus saw her / the more that he did behold her / The more he was taken of
the love of the pucelle. And more willing and sore chaffed for to fight with
Eneas. And said to the queen / Madame weep not for me / Nor doubt not of no
thing / For it is better that we two fight together / Than that our folk
should slay each other. When turnus had spoken thus he did make his (...) to
be brought before him and his harneys and armed himself much rychely as of
custom was after the facyen and manner of the land at that time / And the
king Latyne had sent his messagers toward Eneas: for to announce unto him that
Turnus was already appareylled for to fight body to body aienst him / Of the
bataylle was eneas right glad and anon armed him. And of both parties they
assembled them all In afayre plain before the cite for to see the bataylles
of this two barons which should have be merueyllouse. And the ladies and the
pucelles were mounted upon the walls and the queen also. The king latyne was
issued out of the cytee with Turnus and with his men / And of both sides they
made sacrefyces for him with whom they held / And the king Latyne and the
other barons devised the couenaunces / That who some ever were vanquyshed.

Joy / For they trowed that it had be to them a good bytokenynge: And
thereof arose thorughe all the ooste a great murmr and a great noise. and
houered in them self so sore / that for a lityll / they would have ro^ne
upon the trojans / Then spoke a deuynoure that was called Tholomeus: and said
in audyence / Lords turnyens this was that I desired for to see some tokens
from the gods / That egle that lighted among the hepe of swannes sygnyfieth
our enmye stranger. that is Eneas that wastes and dystroyeth our land / But
let us advise also that we enuyronne him round about with good men of
arms. as the swannes did the egle / And let us deffende Turnus against him
/ and well I wot that he shall flee away out of our country And thus shall
we be delyuerde of him. And then when he had thus said. He shot an arowe
toward the trojans / and smote a knight and ouerthrewe him to the ground
bytwyx the other that were thereof all abashed

How Turnus did great dommage to Eneas folk: Capitulum Lxo.
Ten began again the bataylle of the one part / And of the other Eneas
ascryed to them and said. Lords why do ye fight / Ye know well that the
couuenaunte is devised and made / That Turnus and I shall fight for you all /
While that eneas said these words. and cried unto his folk that they should
not fight / There was a quareyll launched in to his hand / and wyste never
who shot hit. Then departed Eneas from thens / and Turnus and his folk
ran soon to fetch their armures. And then Turnus smote him self in to
the trojans / Turnus at his coming on did great dommage to the trojans For
he was a right valyaunte knight of his / body. And desired much for to
dyscomfyte them. He satte upon a charyette with four wheles and four white
horses did led him He had with him the darts for to launche and cast /
And his other armures for to assaylle and fight from far and of nyghe Soon
after that he was come to the medlee. he slew Thelemon and Thamy town and
Potym and Glathome / and Tasdome / And after came there a troien toward him /
that was sone of Ozon of troy / that was right well armed of rich armures /
And to the same lauched Turnus a darte / and ouerthrewe him full sore wounded.
And as soon as he saw him a ground / he made his horse to tarry. and alyghted
down from his charyotte. and set his foot upon his neck and shoued his
sword in to his throtte / And after he said to him. Trojan here is the land
that thou have required for to fight against me / whefore I shall give to the
thy fylle thereof / and with the same he took his hand fulle of earth fro the
ground and filled his throat therwithalle. while that he was apassynge / And
wite for veraye truth said Turnus to him. that all thus I shall reward
them of thy nacyon that shall comme against me In bataylle Anoone after that he
had said these words to the troyen / He recountred another that was called
Habitem and was the felawe of him to whom he had thus spoken / And slew him
incontinent and after him many other moo / And while that Turnus went thus
thrughe the bataylle all at his will sleynge the troyens. Eneas and
Menesteus and Achates and Ascanyus came to the medlee / For Eneas had be
alonge espace therfro for cause of the wound that he had had In his hand
and spored his horse at that side where he wist that turnus was. And he and
his knights made room before them and slew down many of the Latynes and
turnyens at every hand of hem and soon abashed the Ytalyens so that they
trembled for feere. Eneas slew Afram and Osanum Achetym and Pulerum and gyas
and also Atherantum / And tholomus that be ganne the medlee lost there his
lyffe / for a scanyus slew him at first stroke that he smotte him with the
glayue / Then a rose the noise and the cry sore great of both sides / But
the Latynes might no longer endure and turned their bakkes and went away /
Eneas that chassed would not slay them no more. But did call and sought after
Turnus In the great press / And with noon other he welde fight. Turnus tarried
not long In one place. But went ever here and there alonge the wings of the
bataylles whereby he did great dommage to the troyens / then did Eneas
assemble all the great bataylles / And aduysed him self / that he should
draw toward the cite. that was all abashed / Then called he to him
Menesteus and Sarestum that were connestables of his folk / and of the
bataylles. And said to them / make our folk to wythdrawe them from the
bataylle. And bring them toward the mountain nyghe to the cite. For I would
take hit if I may / or else Turnus shall fight with me / And they did soon
as Eneas had commanded them. They made their folk for to draw toward the
walls of the town or cite / and brought ladders with them / Eneas was a
fore. and cried on high to king Latyne / that full ylle he kept his
couuenauntes. Among them within the cite moeued then. a great dyscorde and
varyaunce. For some would have opened the gates to Eneas. But the other would
not so / but would defend the land ayenste him / For they heelde them self
of turnus party:

How the queen Amatha hanged herself by dyssperacyon: Capitulum lxj
When Amatha saw the thing goo thus / and apperceyued the ladders that the
trojans did set up to the walls / And the fire that they casted in to the
cite. and saw not Turnus that should defend her / Wherefor she wend that he
had be slain. Then had she her thought sore troubled / And anon she
went in to a chamber without company / and took the lyffe from her and
hanged her self And when the tidings thereof were known in the town. they
were so affrayed that little deffence was made there. Who then had seen
Lauyne pullyng and rentyng her yelowe heeres had had of her great pity /
And king Latyne that more abashed was than Lauyne rented his roobes / And
pulled of his heeres. And blamed him self right sore that he had not given
his daughter to Eneas / During this Turnus understood the great sorrow that was
made within the cite by a kynghte of his. that was smyten with a glayue
thorughe the thyhe. and came ayenste him as fast as he might spore and
waloppe his horse / And said / Turnus have mercy on thy men / For in the is
our last hope / Eneas fyghteth hard ayenste the cite. And threteneth all the
tow^es to be brought down / And wit that he does fire to be cast in to the
town / And the king Latyne blames him self much. and knows not what he
shall do / But to turn him self against the with Eneas. and give him both
his daughter and his royame And that more is Amatha the queen that loved the
so much and that was to the so good afrende has killed her self her own
hand whereof the town is sore moeued / And before the gates is noon of thin
that defends against the troyens. Sauff Mesapus and Acyllas they withs^ande
and keep thentre against the bataylles of the troyens / And thou art here
gawrynge about naught. When Turnus herd the same he was ashamed and right
sore wroth and on angerd / And looked toward the cyt^e and saw the flame of
the fire within the town. When he saw that. he lyghted down from his charyot
and went toward the gate where were the great bataylles. Then began he to
make a sign to his men that they should draw back For he would fight for
them with Eneas hand to hand In a field as it was devised before /

How Eneas and Turnus faught body to body In a field one against the other.
Capitulum Lxij:
ANoone as Eneas herd turnus speak / he made no taryinge at all but went
as soon as he might toward the field / and left the sawtyng of the walls and
of the toures that they had enuayshed Then departed from the assawte the
one party and the other for to see the bataylle of the two barons. Eneas and
Turnus were both In the field all alone well appareyl^ed and aproched each
other right hard like two bulls / and drew out their sharp swerdes /
Then was there no sparynge. But that euerych of them smote his enmye so
that ye sheldes wherewith all they covered theymselfe were all to hewn and
broken all to pieces / the bataylle was fyerse and cruelle for they hated each
other right sore / But at the last turnus was ouercomme / and he cried mercy
to eneas that he sh^lde not slay him. And wit that Eneas should have pardoned
him that yt he had mysdoon against him. if it had not be the ^ynge and the
gyrdell of palas that turnus did were upon him for when eneas did see them /
the sorrow that he made for ye death of Palas that turnus had slain was
renewed in his heart / which redoub^ed then his great wrath / and said to
turnus thou shall abye now the gladness that thou had of the death of Palas /
For thou shall here deye for his sake / And anoone he shoued his sword thrughe
the body of him wherout his soul departed / All thus was conquered all
Lombardye and the pucelle Lauyne by the hand of eneas /

Hw eneas wedded Lauyne and had the royalme of Ytalye. Capitulum / Lxiij
ANoone as Turnus was slain / his friends departed right sorry and wroth / And
many other with them / that loved him for his proesse The king Latyne that
was right sore of his great myschaunce. Came to Eneas / his noble men with him.
and gaff him his daughter / and all his royame / And received him with great
I^ye / and then was the peace made toward them that had be against him /
Anon the trojans and the latynes together went for to brenne and reduce to
ashes bodies ded that were yet in the feeldes / And when that was done / the
queen Camula was sent in to her land. and the queen Amatha was rychely
brought to her sepulture. Then was ceased all the sorrow thorughe all the
royame of ytalye Eneas that had had many a sore pain by the space of seven
years. sith that he came from Troy took to his wyff Lauyne the daughter of
king Latyne that heelde laurence. the maystresse cite of lombardye at that
time / And much Joy was there made at their wedding /

How king Latyne deceassed / And Eneas soon after him / And how Ascanyus was
called Iulyus Capitulum lxiiij
AFter this abode not long. but that the king Latynus deyed / and deceassed
out of this mortalle world / Then heelde Eneas all the royame But werres
enough he had there. For Merencyus that heelde Cecylle werred ayenste him /
But Eneas vaynquysshed him not / By cause that death took him sooner than he
wend But after the death of Eneas. his sone Ascanyus faughte with Merencyus
body to body and sleewe him / and then he was called ascanyus iulyus by cause
his first berde was but young when he slew Mezencyum / when eneas had brought
yt lord in peace and had delivered it from great myserye / the death yt no
body spares ran him upon In such a manner / that no body could neuere
know how he lost his lyffe / Some sayen that he was slain with the thonder
bolte the other sayen that the gods had rauyshed him / the other sayen his
body was found within a ponde or a water that is nyghe the tonyre which is
called Munycum of them of the countreye / Eneas lived but three year after that
he had wedded Lauyne the daughter of king Latyne thus as we have said

How Ascanyus held the royalme of Ytalye after the death of Eneas his fader /
Capitulum. Lxv
AFter the death of Eneas held the royalme Ascanyus his sone that he had of
the daughter of the king Pryamus of Troy / And Lauyne abode great with child
of a son. Wherefore she doubted sore lest that Ascanyus should make him deye
In treyson for to hold all the royalme / Therefore was she right sorry / And
for feere that she had of it / She fled away In to the forest wythyn the
lodges of Errorus that was a pastor And there she was tylle that she was
delivered of her sone that had to name Syluyus postumus / when Ascanyus wiste
where his stepmoder was goon and that she had a sone which was his brother /
he sent her word that she should comme to him without any feere / She
returned and came again to herstepsone ascanius berynge her son siluyus between
her arms: ascanyus gaffe by ye cou^seill of his barons of his land to his
brother Syluyum the cite of Lawrence with the appartenaunces. Ascanyus builded
first the town or cite of Albe in lombardye. And there was his resorting /
by the space of xxxviij. years that he heelde his reygne. after the death of
his fader Eneas. And of this cite ben many in doubt who build it up.
Ascanyus or else Syluyus postunus his brother / By cause that all the knyges
of lombardye that were sith Ascanyus unto Romulus that founded rome had to
name Syluyus for the highness of him. that first heelde and builded Albe.
This Syluyus was right valyaunte / and mayntened well the royame / And therefore
all they that came after him were called Syluyus / like as after Caesar Augustus
/ for his worthynesse. all the emperors of rome that were after him are named
Augustus. Ascanyus had a sone that called was Iulyus / but when Ascanyus
deyed Iulyus was to young for to rewle the royame / And therefore he gaaff hit to
Syluyus postunus his brother by Eneas his fader. which he loved much. and
taught him well and chastysed him well as long as he was a live / And wit
that after that he was ded / the queen Lauyne had a sone by Melompodes that
had to name Latynus siluyus. After Ascanyus reigned Syluyus postunus his
brother Of Iulyus the sone of Ascanyus issued Iulyen / of whom descended Iulyus
Caesar / And know that from the time that the children of ysrahel came out of
thraldom fro the king of Egypt Pharao. Wha^ they passed the red see / unto
Ascanyus time. that was was king of Lombarde was.CCCC.lxvij years / After
Syluyus postunus that was king.xxix. years / held the royame latynus syluyus.l
