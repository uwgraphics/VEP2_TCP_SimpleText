THO: WEEKS R.P. Epo. Land. Cap. domest. THE Life and Death of MAHOMET.
MOst writers accord, that Mahomet which name in the Arabique signifies
Indignation or Fury, was the son of Abdalla a Merchant in Mecca, a City in
Arabia Faelix; his mother a Jew, and himself in Anno Dom. 571. borne
Posthumus. At the second year of his age his mother deceased, a poor woman
that labored for her living bred him up; at 16 years of age he became a
Merchants bondsman, his Master, pleased with his wit and dexterity, made him his
Factor: He dead, Mahomet being then twenty five years old, married his Mistress
and until the thirty eighth year of his age, he industriously followed his
trade of Merchandise, avoiding no personal travel (as well in the kingdoms of
Egypt, Syria and Persia, as elsewhere) where profit might arise. Being then
satisfied with wealth, and given to ease, he began to think on his Soul,
whereof in his travels he had not been negligent, having been curious to
understand the Religions of the Jews and Christians; which compared with the
Idolatry wherein he was originally trained thirty years) did work in him
assurance that Paganism was the way to perdition, but to whether of these to
incline, he stood doubtful. At last falling in company with two Christian
Artificers, inhabitants in Mecca, by conversation with them (who read the old
and new Testament unto him, for himself was unlettered) he approved
Christianisme for the best, and was of opinion that thereby, only, a man might
attain unto Salvation, and accordingly he framed his life, which bred
admiration in them that knew him, and gave him a greater reputation than he did
expect.

But this hasty spring was quickly blasted; for the Devil, taking advantage
upon his weakness, enflamed his heart with pride, which wrought in him a desire to
be esteemed a Prophet thinking all other attributes of Religion and sanctity to
be but vile and base: To aspire unto that opinion he embraced a solitary life,
retyring to a Cave in the Mountains, where he lived free from the ordinary
conversation of men; repaired seldom to his own home, and his speeches (mixed
with gravity and holiness teaching good life, and beating down Idolatry)
moved, not only such as saw him to admire, but the rest also (that heard by
other men's ears) held him to be a Saint. To increase this opinion of
sanctimony, of the falling sickness (wherewith he was afflicted) he made good
use; for, he gave it out (when he fell into his fitts incident to that disease)
that he conferred with the Angel Gabriell, by whom the pleasure of God was
revealed unto him, and that his Trances proceeded through the weakness of his
earthly Carcass that was astonished at the divine presence of the heavenly
Ambassador.

Grown now famous he thought it necessary to divulge into the world some works
in wrighting, whereby his name might increase: His best help was a Jew scribe,
who for want of a better scholar he entertained; but shortly after, his Master
the Devil (the Church of Christ then laboring with the sickness of many
Haeresies) procured the acquaintance of a Christian called Sergius born in
Alexandria, by profession a Monk, and by infection a Nestorian, witty,
eloquent and learned, who having mist of some Ecclesiastical preferment which
in his opinion he had deserved) full of despite and revenge, in a divelifh
discontent, sought as well to raise a scandal upon the Christian Religion, as
upon the professors thereof; the readiest way to kindle this fire, he found to
be Mahomet; who (as is already said) had won some extraordinary opinion of
sanctity. After some conference between them, the Jew for insufficiency was
discharged. Sergius being fully informed how Mahomet had hitherto proceeded,
made him to understaud how weakly and grossly he had erred in fundamental
points, necessary for the advancement of a new Religion; and cunningly showed
him, not only the means how to smoothe his past errors without scandal, but
to compose a new treatise, collected out of the old and new Testament (with
devised additions that should give credit to his Doctrine and humor the
hearers) which being divulged amongst the Idolatrous people (who were easily
caught) spread the poison it contained over all the Arrabies, but the wiser
sort fearing (as they had cause) that the settling of a new Religion, might also
draw with it a new form of government; opposed themselves against it, calling
Mahomet an Imposter, reproving his hypocrisy, and taxing his sensuality and
drunkenness (of both which he was guilty) and sent to apprehend him; whereof
Mahomet from some of his friends in Mecca having notice left his Cave, and fled
to the Deserts [the sixteenth of July 622 from which flight the Turks begin
their computation Athegira] unto whom diverse Novelists resorted; as also such
as the Estates had banished for approving his late coined trash: This swarm of
Wasps being stirred, nothing but revenge could ease their hearts; Mahomet
willingly taking the advantage there offered, enlarged his thoughts, holding it
now less difficill for him to obtain a kingdom, then the title of a Prophet
which he had obtained.

To make a smoothe way to his enterprise, by underhand means, he exasperated
the heady Novelists (whereof there were many of wealth and estimation) to be
sensible of their banishment, and to repair their wrongs by force; himself
recounted unto them Revelations which assured him that God was displeased with
the Meccans, for the rigorous persecuting of him and his Sectuaries; that God
willed to chastize their Tyranny; of victory he was assured, and whosoever of
them died in that holy War, his Soul should presently ascend to Heaven: with
these and such like motives the giddy people encouraged and seduced, elected
Mahomet to be their Chief, who (ordayning Officers and Captains, and
receiving an Oath of fidelity as well from them, as from their troops) marched
to the City of Almedina, and took it by force: This first good fortune wrought
the effect he desired, for instantly by his Army, he was saluted Calipha;
which, interpreted, is King, and because his creation happened upon a Friday,
that day was ordained by him to be their Sabbath.

His next conquest was the City of Mecca where he triumphed in the blood of his
neighbor Citizens, which was not spared; and proclaimed death to all those
that did not embrace his Doctrine.

The Princes and great men in Arabia (opposite unto him) assembled all their
forces. Mahomet, being too weak was overthrown wounded, and fled to Mecca; yet
in the end the war continuing) he prevailed, and reduced the three Arabies
under his subjection. Grown great and glorious with his victories, and at that
time the Emperor of Constantinople and King of Persia being men of weak and
tame Spirits, he invaded their Dominions, and with a conquering sword triumphed
over Syria, the City of Jerusalem, the kingdom of Mesopotamia and Persia, the
great City of Babylon with other Eastern Provinces; of all which as of the
Arabies, he styled himself King being now grown elde^ by his inordinate life,
in the state of his body then in years, which exceded not fifty seven, full of
glory, as well in regard of his large Empire, as in opinion of sanctity, in
being esteemed a Prophet, and weary with war, with a fained holiness (under
which mask he intended to take his ease) sequestered himself from public
affairs, committing the government of his estates to the Lievetenants within
in three years following, which was in Anno Domini 631, the sixtith year of
his Age, and the tenth of his Reign he died: Upon his deathbed he commended
unto his principal Commanders, the care and use of his fantastical Law,
assuring them that it was agreeable to the will of God, and that so long as
they and their posterity should hold and maintain it, they should flourish.

This false Prophet and usurping Prince, pretended paternally to descend from
the Patriarch Abraham by his eldest Son Ismael, and to avoid the infamy of
an unlawful bed his successors affirmed that Ismael was the Son of Sara, not
of the bondwoman Agar whereupon the Arabians (which is the undoubted name of
that people) are by some writers (of Ismael) called Ismalites, and by others
(of Agar) Agarens. And (of Sara) Sarazens, but in this latter time they are
distinguished by the name of Arabians Moors, and Mahometans, the first is
proper only to those which inhabit in Arabia: the Mores are the progeny of such
Arabians as after their Conquests seated themselves in that part of Africa,
the Manometans is the general name of all nations that profess Mahomet, as
Turks, Tartars, Persians, etc.

Of the successors of Mahomet until the year of our Lord 673, the writers vary
in opinion both in name, and number of the Caliphaes and in the years of their
reigns: the reason that begat their errors proceeded from the dissension that
happened (about the succession) amongst Mahomet's kinsmen, evermore
anti-Caliphaes starting up with pretended titles in opposition to him that had
the Diadem; whereof some were murdered and others deposed, so as the writers
either out of ignorance (not able to discern the truth, or wilfully partial)
have erred. Notwithstanding their civil tumults they kept Mahomet's Dominions,
and inherited his fortunes, for every of them added somewhat to his Monarchy,
where by they became fearful to the world, and potent in Asia, Africa, and
Europe.

The fourth Calipha (agreed upon by Historiographers) was callded Hozman or
Azman husband to Mahomet's daughter, who perceiving (that in this upstart
Religion) Schisms and diversities of opinions began to rise, by the help of
his wifes mother recovered Mahomet's papers wherein his law was written, which
he caused to be digested into one volume contaning four books divided into
206 Chapters, and called it the Alcoran, commanding the same to be published,
and upon pain of death to be observed by his subjects. He was a great
Conqueror, and wan much upon the Christians: but this discourse treats not of
his particular actions, or of his successors (until the reign of Abilqualet
Jacob Myramamolin surnamed Almanzor (which interpreted is the defendor of the
law of God) son to Abilqualet Calipha of the Arabians, who seeing his sons
ability to govern, himself (by reason of years exceeding 70, unable to
manage public affairs) in the year of Christ 675. resigned his Scepter
unto him: Without comparison he was the greatest Monarch then living upon the
earth. The seat of his Empire (as his predecessors accustomed) was at Zarvall
in Arabia Foelix, from east to west his dominions were bounded with the river
Indus in Asia, and the Atlantic seas which in length exceeded the Roman
Empire. The conquests he made were admirable, all which in this collection are
omitted until the 37 year of his reign in which he attempted the conquest of
Spain, abreviated out of two Arabique writers translated into Spanish in anno.
1606. Both the Authors living in his time, the one a Captain in that war, and
the other for 20 years together of Almanzors chamber, and after his death a
Provincial Governor in Arabia Foelix.

In the year of our redemption 712. Don Roderigo in the right of Don Sancho
his elder brothers Soon (then in minority) swayed the Spanish Monarchy,
having so fair a Jewel in his possession, and unwilling to loose kingly power
(after so long use of it) his impostumed heart swollen with Ambition, poysned in
the center, restles and care full; he only held and approved such Counsel
(without respect of conscience or honor) as might work his end. The way to
fix the Crown to his head (which while his Nephew lived sat loose) was to
deprive him of his life. Anagilda (mother to Don Sancho) fearing what she
suspected and suspecting no less then there was cause, had a watchful eye
over her son; as much afflicted how to avoid harm, as Don Roderigo was
perplexed how to contrive it. The first project was to poison him at a banquet,
but the mothers care prevented the innocents danger, that failing he corrupted
one Ataulpho his Favorite to kill him; Ataulpho not prodigal of his life,
which he knew to be in danger, both in hot and cold blood after a murder,
persuaded Don Roderigo to frame some coulourable accusations against him, and
once in prison he might at leisure without any peril, act what he listed.
Ataulpho was presently sent with commission to apprehend Don Sancho, then
resident in Cordova, promise of reward gave him wings in his post, at midnight
the Prince was taken in his bed, carried out of the town and committed to
guard. Anagilda though greived beyond expression with the accident, yet being a
Lady of great spirit, armed such servants and friends as she had; pursued
Ataulpho besiedged the Castle where he and her son were; took it by force,
him prisoner: slew the rest, and recovered the Prince, which done, trussing up
her treasure and jewels with a small train of her servants, she fled to a
port town appertaining to the Earl Don Julian; but fearing that no part of
Spain would be able to protect her against Regal authority, she resolved to
pass into Africa; at her departure she wrote unto the King: the messenger
was Ataulpho: his reward, life and liberty: yet with loss of nose and ears,
as a mark of infamy due unto him for undertaking the execution of a wicked
act. The King Roderigo not thinking it possible (in the employment against his
Nephewe) to meet with cross accidents, knew not how with discretion to
govern his conceived joys, for such was his opinion of Ataulphoes wit, and
confidence in his love, that h^ assured himself the design was effected; bu^
as reckoning made without an host is subject to a rear account: so this
Prince out of his window seeing Ataulpho entering into his gates dismembered of
nose and ears, stood both amused and amazed, but when Ataulpho had recounted
unto him his misfortunes, and that the Prince and his mother were out of his
reach, his passion so far mastered his reason, as that he seemed mad: and like
to one in a frenzy; took the letter, and read it by snatches; pointing
nothing truly: and understanding no whit what he read. The content^ were
taxations of hi^ Loyalty toward hi^ sovereign Lord, hi^ Nephewe. That he had
maliciously out of ambition and self love, unnaturally sought his destruction,
she put him in mind what an unworthie thing it was for a man of courage and
spirit to make war upon a woman and an infant willed him to call his conscience
to account, to repent his sinful enterprise, to content himself with his
own estate, and to restore the Kingdom to the right heir, but if their
admonitions were like Corn in stony ground, or as words in the air fruitnes,
her confidence then was that God, as well for the justnes of the cause which
she pursued, as to punish his wickedness, would give her mean and strength to
chastize him: If he would know a brief relation of his attempt against his
Nephewe, she will led him to read the story in Ataulphoes face, where it was
engraven. This letter the demonstrative characters of scorn, and revenge
feared upon the nose and ears of Ataulpho together with the report of his
successes, increased his fury, but passion being over: he sent for the Carle
Don Julian Lord of Algazira to know of him the Queens intentions whereof he
could not be ignorant having been her host. He assured him that she was gone
into Africa to demand succor and raise war in Spain. Don Roderigo to prevent
this growing storm employed tht Earl. (furnished and laoden with
Instructions, Present and Jewels) to Mur Leivetenant in the Moroccoes for the
great Calipha Almanzor to confirm amity, and to dissuade him from ayding the
fugitive Queen which Negotiation (according to the trust reposed) he
faithfully discharged; but before his embassage had received answer, the
Queen and her Son the Prince sickned and dyed at Tunger: whereof Don
Roderigo being informed lost no time to solemnize his coronation, the Crown
(by his Nephews death) being when his right, but yet his conscience accusing
him of his wickedness, he feared revenge from those that were faithful unto
his Nephew^ for prevention whereof some he displaced from their goverments,
other^ were imprisoned, and many under color o^ Justice executed. For hi^
further security he disarmed his subjects; such Castles and strength^ as he
was jealous o^ were raced, other fortified and co^mited to the trust of his
own creatures, which done he thought he might (parler ensire) give laws and
take his pleasure, which he spared not sensually to follow in enticing and
forcing (without respect of qualities) men's wives and daughters. Yet being
desirous of lawful issue to set up his seat, he took to wife a stranger
which happened unto him by a strange accident. At that time there lived in the
Eastern part of Africa a Moore King called Mahomet Abnebedin whose only
daughter and heir^ Zabra, with other young Ladies her attendants (wantonly
disposed to be sea-sicke) the weather inviting them to it: put to the sea; but
this fair calm was suddenly clouded with a storm, and such a continued
fret ensued, as that for safety of their lives, they were enforced to spoone
before the wind; which continuing for many days together, at last cast them
upon the coast of Spain, where with difficulty (sick and weather-beaten)
they arrived at a place called Caba de Gata, taken prisoners and sent to Don
Roderigo, who after a few days enchanted with her beauty, became her
prisoner. The young Lady, though a Mohammedan borne, yet to better the
condition of a Captive dispensed with her Religion: was Baptized and solemnly
married unto him. Those of her train of either sex that would turn Christians
remained with her; the rest were honorably sent home. The Moore King hearing of
his daughters fortune (as if he had been stricken with a thunderbolt) instantly
died. Unto whom Almanzor the great Calipha succeeded as his next Cousin. Don
Roderigo wallowing in his pleasures, and in them never satisfied, was shortly
after surprised with a new love, which proved his destruction: the Earl don
Julian all this while was resident in Africa negotiating for his master, with
Mura Almanzors Leivetenant in the Moroccoes, to accompany the young Queen his
daughter Florinda was sent for; the King pursued her love, which being not able
to obtain by consent, he performed by violence. The young Lady full of
disdain and malice by letters to her father complained her misfortunes,
praying him to take revenge of her wrong. Don Julian sensible of his daughters
dishonor (which reflected upon him) hastened his return, and like a wise man
smoothely covering his wounds gave the King a good account of his Embassage;
but yet so involved with doubts, as that his return into Africa was resolved
necessary. At his departure he entreated the King to permit Florinda for a
few months to repair to her mother, for in her the comfort of her life
consisted, which the King with seeming willingness unwillingly granted: When the
Earl had recovered his own house, he sent for his friends and kinsmen, related
unto them the particular wrong done to his daughter and the dishonor cast upon
their family, wherein they were all interessed: he besought their advise and
aid. At last it was concluded he should go into Africa to incite Muza
Almanzors Leivetenant to invade Spain, and they all protested never to lay
down Arms until their honors by revenge were repaired. Don Julian presently
imbarqued for Africa himself, his wife, daughter, his whole family, his
moveable goods of price, where being safely arrived (according to his quality)
he was entertained by Mura, to whom he related the rape of his daughter, and
the dishonor cast upon their family, promising him if he might be assisted in
the revenge to assure unto his master Almanzor the conquest of Spain. Though
the proposition pleased Mura, yet in a matter of that weight, he durst not
pass his promise until Almanzors pleasure was signified; and therefore advised
don Julian to go into Arabia, and he would give him Lettes of credit which
he doubted not would expedite his desires: The Earl with a favorable passage
landed in Syria and so over land with in a few days post, presented himself
to Almanzor, who being a wise Prince rich, strong in men, and satisfied with
Don Iulian's Letter, which in all likelihood promised a good event, yet he
thought it wisdom at the first with a small charge to make trial, before he
were too far plunged in war, and concluding upon this Counsel he dismissed the
Earl laden with rewards, honorable usage, and an answer to Muza, which being
by him received he victualled and embarked 6000 foot and a few horse:
Committed to the charge of Tarif Abinzioc [ alias Tarif Abonzarca] born in
Syria in the City Damasco; but to follow the advice of don Julian in whose
wisdom his hope was exposed with these troops they landed at a place named by
the Moors Jabalsgath, by interpretation the Mountain of Conquest, and since
corruptly called Gibralter, they were no sooner landed, but don Iulian's
confederats, joined with them, burnt and harrazed the Country, slew all those
whom they thought loyal to don Roderigo and rich in spoil, and prisoners
reimbarqued, for Africa. Don Roderigo hearing the relations of this first
attempt, and fearing a greater tempest, began to repent him of his sensual
life, and especially of his violating Florinda, who had moved revenge in her
Father; whose wisdom, power and valor, was to be feared, as also his tyranny
exercised upon the dependants of his Nephew; which had made him hateful to his
people; his praecipitate Councels in defacing Castles and strong places; the
disarming of his Subjects, and the too prodigal waste of his Treasure, all
which presented unto him imminent calamities irreparable: Yet these designs of
terror, did not so much amaze him, as he neglected to prepare for a war,
wherein no means was ommitted to prepare strength, treasure and victuals, for
a necessary defense; Muza, Tarif and Julian, having their spirits raised by
their fortunes, resolved the prosecution of the Conquest, but wanting authority
to proceed, Tarif and Julian (joined in Commission) were dispatched to
Almanzor, who received them with great honor, and being persuaded by
demonstrative reasons how facile it was to perform that enterprise, he
applauded the project, and hastening them away, made election of Tarif to be the
General for the war, authentically firmed under his hand and seal, dated at
his Palace at Zarvall in Arabia Foelix, the two and twentieth day of December
713/92: also presently by Commission he raised troops in the Levant, to the
number of 30000 well armed, which he committed to the leading of Hira, a Greek
Renegado his favorite: He likewise wrote to the king of Tunis his kinsman for
forces, who leavied of his own Subjects 30000 foot and 3000 horse, sending with
them for their chief his second son Mahomet Gilhaimre. These forces
aforesaid were leavied in the Months of June and August, in Anno 714/93 and
safely arrived in the Moroccoes where Muza for their relief quartered them
upon the Country, until he heard from Tarif and Julian, who with 6000 foot
and 300 horse, Christians and Moors, were passed into Spain to seize upon some
port, to assure their landing. The place they made choice of; was (in favor of
the general) called Tariff [before called Ca^teya] and since corruptly Tarifa.

Don Roderigo, watchful to withstand their landing, described an army to the
field of 30000 foot, and 5000 horse commanded by his faithful servant
dismembered Ataulpho. In the first encounter Tarif was beaten and routed, much
blood drawn, and arms lost. The next morning an old woman willingly taken) was
brought to Tarif by his Sentinels; having kissed his feet; Sir said she believe
what I shall tell you for I am the messenger of good news. When was a child. I
heard my Father who was let^ered often read in a ^ooke (much esteemed by him)
That this Kingdom should be Conquered by the Moors; Their captain should
have on his right shoulder an hairy Moale as big as a pease: That his right
arm should be longer then his left and standing upright he might easily touch
his knee, if you (said she) have these marks then God has ordained this
conquest for you My humble suite is, that my poor family, and my self may
have your safeguard, that in our bodies and goods we may receive no prejudice;
Tarif glad to hear this description of himself (for he had these signs
which she named) to satisfy don Julian and the whole army put off his
clothes; they found it true, and the poor woman went joyful away, obtaining
her suite. The army encouraged by this passage were greedy to fight, and Tarif
no less confident (to hold them by necessity valiant) burn all his ships a
Pinnace excepted, which he preserved to send relations of his success to Mura.
The next day they joined battle, the Christians were defeated: Ataulpho
(expressing as much wisdom and valor as could be required in a General)
slain; Tarif and don Julian were both wounded, one in the Arm the other in
the leg. Of this victory they sent advertisement to Mura, and desired him to
hasten away the supplies which came from Arabia, and Tunis. On the other side
don Roderigo (making his Rendevous at Cordova) drew to an head 80000 foot, and
10000 horse: the Vantguard of his troops (which consisted of 50000 foot and
3000 horse) he assigned to his Cosen don Orpas (Archbishop of Sivill) to
confront the enemy. In the mean time supplies from the Moroecoes arived, and
Tarif's army by poole was 60000 foot and 10000 horse strong; Orpas in hope to
win honor, began to skirmish which procured the joining of their forces; Night
took up the quarrel almost with equal loss. The night following the Moors
gave a Canvasado upon don Orpas, the Christians to a man were all slain and
taken prisoners, and their General presented alive to Tarif; Mura (as he was
glad for the general cause of these good successes, yet emulating Tarif)
raised in his government an army of 25000 foot; 6000 horse and volunteers
infinite accomodated with all provisions meet for a war; and leaving his
brother Ismael to govern in his absence he passed into Spain, and being
joined to Tarif's troops they mustered 180000 foot; and 40000 horse.

Don Roderigo seeing his enemies forces so hugely increased, and two of his
armies defeated resolved to set up his rest, and in person to hazard his
fortune. His army upon an exact muster appeared to be 130000 foot and 25000
horse: for his Leivetenant General he nominated don Almeriq; a man of known
valor; and his Cabinet Counselor. Unto his troops (to raise up their weak
spirits) he made a speech. They promised in defense of him, and their Country
to do the offices of faithful subjects and Patriotts, which don with alacrity
they marched toward the enemy, but with this ill passage, for don Ruero the
kings Standard bearer fell suddenly dead from his horse and brake the staff;
which wrought effects of fear in many, not long after these puissant Armies
lodged close together. The first three days from morning to night (with much
but equal loss) they skirmished. The day following being the third of October
714/94 the most of their troops on either side were drawn forth; the Moors
lost 10000 foot, and 300 horse, the Christians 3000 foot and 800 horse,
together with don Almeriq; their Leivetenant General, after one days rest
they sought again from noone til night; in which on either part much blood was
drawn, and Mahomet the King of Tunis son and don Julian, grievously wounded.

The next day with equal desire of revenge they encountered, but stormy weather
parted the quarrel not without great slaughter.

The wednesday following their forces joined, the Christians were broken and
routed; and few escaped the edge of the sword. But don Roderigo by the goodness
of his horse escaped. Tarif prosecuting the victory marched to Cordova, and
with out resistance took it; but in his heart not satisfied because the King
was fled, he proclaimed that whosoever would bring his person to him, either
alive, or dead should be honored, and rewarded according to his own content.
Hope of gain provoked diverse (as well Christians as Moors and Renegadoes) to
make search for him; and a man clothed like the King, and for the king was
presented to Tarif, but in examination it appeared it was a shephard, with whom
the king (his horse being tired) changed his garments; but what that man was,
or whether he went he knew not; after that he was nevermore heard of: and of
his issue no mention is made by any writers, but of one daughter named Donna
Eligona a Lady of incomparable beauty who was a sucking infant when her
Father died. Of her a few words by way of digression is not impertinent. She
was fostered by one Cratilo (her fathers servant) and as his child amongst his
children nourished, with whom she lived concealed until she was 24 years
old, Cratilo would have married her to his son but she disdained the match.
A Nephew of Cratilo's (being passionately in love with her) maliced his Cosen,
and to break the match (which still he feared) he discovered the concealed
Lady to Abdalices, General in Spain for the Monarch of the Arabians that
then was, who fell in love with his Captive and took he^ to wife permitting
her the exercise of her own Religion. Not long after he rebelled, and in his
wives right proclaimed himself King of Spain, his Captain and Leivetenants
fearing that his love to his wife would make him to turn Christian slew him in
his house, the Queen frighted with the murder being great with child fell in
labor and died. In her the issue of don Roderigo the last King of the Gothish
blood in Spain failed. The Queen Zabra, Don Roderigo's wife, was taken in her
Palace at Cordova, whom Tarif used with all humanity and left her in the
Custody of Mahomet prince of Tunis (not yet recovered of his late hurts) and
for his assistance a Moore named Habdilbar. Then dividing his army into two
parts, the one himself toward the City of Granada and Mura with the other
marched into Andaluzia, but before he departed from Cordova he erected
Mohammedan, Mosquetos, leaving certain churches for Christian service. The
Prince of Tunis carefully tended his fair charge: but in seeking to keep her,
^ost himself: his first attempt was to persuade her (being born a great
Princess and near in blood to Almanzor) to return again to the Mohammedan
law, which ^f she would do, he was sure that Almanzor would restore her
kingdom unto her, and if she could cast her love upon him, he would labor to
merit it, and be her faithful servant. The Lady like a strong sort with
stood his assults, and all his payments were denyalls, for she was resolved
neither to return to her ^omit, nor to be his mistress. His love increasing
she prevailed with him to receive baptism: and that done she yielded to be
his wife; both which were secretly solemnized by a Christian Priest.

Not many days after Sisiberta one of the Ladies which was taken with the
Queen (when by tempest she was driven into Spain) and with her had received
baptism, for the loved a young Moore, renounced Christianity, and betrayed the
late marriage (wherewith she was trusted) unto Habdilbar. Tarif being by him
advertized of the accident, commanded him to imprison the married couple and
the Priest; but because the King of Tunis was great Prince, he durst not
proceed against them as he desired, before the King had been advertized of
his sons acts, which at large in writing (well testified) he sent unto him.
The King enraged returned his express pleasure to behead him unless he would
embrace the Mohammedan law. But these young Princes neither repenting their
baptism, nor fearing the sentence of death (like constant Martyrs with the
Priest that married them) were executed and their bodies cast into a ditch; but
afterward by stealth in the night buried by Christians.

The two Generals, Tarif and Mura with Conquering swords, by force and
Composition (in South Spain) bare all before them (the City of Hispalis now
Sevill only excepted) which they forbear my approach fearing the plague,
wherewith it was visited; their troops over travailed and spent with long
Marches (ordinary duties whereto Armies in the field are subject) and want of
Clothes, required rest; which moved the Generals to retreite to the Randevous
at Cordova, where after supplies of provision made, and the soldiers refresh't,
they concluded to join their forces, and to invade Castile, in which Province
their Army found small resistance, the weaker places sent submission before
summoning, the stronge^ yielding upon Composition, so that in a ma^ne^ they
might say as Caesar Veni, Vidi, Vici, with this prosperous success they marched
over the mountains Pyrene until they came upon the French ground; their
desires led them further, but the great Almanzor's Commissions listed them
within Spain, which Counseled their retreite through Arragon: Va^entia, and
Murcia: lea^ing, every where, as they marched (in places fit to be held)
sufficient garrisons, with the ^est they returned to Cordova.

In all those Conquests Don Julian accompanied the Generals and for reward of
the good service he, and his kinsmen and followrs had done, Tarif (authorized
b^ Almanzor) did not only possess them of the lands they had, but gave them
larger bounds, l^^censed them to depar^ to their dwellings, and attend their
husbandry. For by the war the Country was merely wasted. Then his care was,
how to hold that he had gotten; the way to keep it was to plans Collonies, the
want he found was women, to supply that defect (the women of Arabia and Africa
being unwilling to com into Spain) he proclaimed the same immunities to the
Christian-men and women (if they would adore Mahomet) as the Moors had. The
poor Spaniards generally afflicted with misery, to repair their own
fortunes; secure their lives, and gain their free-dom; in multitudes took hold
of the Proclamation; forsook their Religion gave their daughters to the Moors
in marriage; and labored the ground: the leading Dear were two Archbishops
Consins to Don Roderigo, one called Don Torifo, the other Don Orpas, before
mentioned, both of them forsaking Christ, and assuming Mahomet for their God.

Yet the Mountanous Countries of the Asturias and Biscayans had not felt the
invadors force, into them for safety many principal men and some of the blood
royal had put themselves.

To subdue that remnant of people, Tarif sent an army of six thousand under
the command of Abrahen a Tartar, and directions to the Garrisons adjoining (as
occasion offered) to assist him, and with him he also sent the two Renegado
Bishops.

The Christians (now Mountaniers) elected a young gentleman of the blood royal,
called Don Pelago to be their King unto whom they gave obedience, and in him al
their hopes remained. When Abrahen was entered the Mountains, he sent the
Renegado Prelates with large promises of reward to persuade them to render. When
they came to Don Pelago's presence and had delivered their message, he bound
them in ropes, and from the top of an high rock they were tumbled where they
ended their wretched days, and the same night the Tartar (trusting to the
Credit of the Renegado Priests) negligent and careless. Don Pelago gave a
Canvasado upon his camp, slew most of his men, and retired to his strength.
Abraheu with a few fled to Toledo where after for shame and grief he died.

Tarif at his unfortunate success was much troubled, and by reason of his many
garrisons not able to put an army into the field to prosecute the war) only
strengthened the frontier, until he received new directions from Almanzor. But
before his dispatches was made he received, from Don Pelago, a letter sent by a
Moore prisoner, wherein he made known unto him his lawful succession (by the
death of don Roderigo) to the kingdom of Spain, and although God in his
Justice had punished him for his offenses; yet in the same God he was confident
not only to be defended from his force; but enabled to recover his right, and
as for the two holy Ambassadors (the Apostate Priests and his kins-men who were
sent by him to persuade him to deny Christ and render subjection) he gave him
notice of their deserved deaths, and concluded, before he would be guilie to
his own dishonor, in submitting himself to an Heathen, or renounce the faith
wherein he was Baptized he would die if he had then a thousand lives; Dated in
the ninth of July 715/94. As Tarif was sorry to understand his resolution, so
was he extreme glad to hear that Don Roderigo was dead, whereof until then
he had not assurance, and in post dispatched a Packet to Almanzor giving him
account of his Conquest, how that all Spain (the Mountains of Biscay and the
Asturias, into which a few Chistians were sled, and the City of Sivilla not
yet free from the plague excepted, were reduced to his obedience. Nevertheles
because his garrisons were many, and the Mountains by their natural strength
almost in accessible, he humbly besought supplies not doubting but to yield
him contentment in his charge. Lastly he recommended unto his favor the good
service of don Julian and of Habdilbar, who in the stead of the Prince of Tunis
he had made Governor of Cordova, being in his opinion the meetest place for
the Royal seat. Almanzor though well pleased with Tarif's relation, yet for
his better information returned his pleasure by the same post, Commanding him
to make his present and personal repair to his Court, to substitute in his
absence Habdilbar (Governor of Cordova) Leivetenant General of Spain, and to
require Mura to return to his government of the Moroccoes, which had need of
his presence. In this mean while Don Julian attended his domestic affairs at
his town of Villa Viciosa, now called Malaga, which being put in some good
order, he sent into Africa for his wife, and daughter, who during the war
remained in Tangier. But Florinda, heart broken and comfortless, transported
with passion beyond her strength, having locked a door behind her, ascended to
the top of the highest Turret in her fathers Castle, then calling for her
Governesse, she prayed her to entreat her parents to come forth, unto whom
she desired to say something before she died. This stragicall summons being by
them obeyed she cursed the day of her birth as well in respect of the dishonor
done to her, as to be the cause of the slaughter of so many Christians, the
extinguishing of Religion and the utter subversion of so flourishing a Kingdom
she accused her father for his over-sharp revenge, and her self she censured
unworthie of life in being the cause of such irreparable mischeifs, after her
prayers to God, her request to her father was, that from thence forth that town
should be no more called Villa Viciosa, but Malacho (which signifies Porque
mala) in memory of her that there ended her life, being the most unfortunate
ill woman that ever lived; and there with all; not giving ear to the
persuasions, and tears of her aged parents, she cast her self headlong to
the ground, and dyed.

The third day following don Julian oppressed with grief fell instantly mad
and killed himself with his punniniard. The old Lady for some longer time
workout a miserable life, eaten with a Canker, rotting living, infamous and
odious to all that beheld her. For want of heirs don Iulian's lands fell by
Escheate to Almanzor.

Tarif being imbarqued for Arabia: Mura in his government and Habdilbar settled
in his Leivetenacie of Spain. Mura fearing that Tarif would rob him of his
honor due unto him, and ascribe unto himself the Conquest of Spain, he sent
his brother Ismael to make particular relation to Almanzor of his merit, and
also in a letter he remembered his own actions, his opinion how Spain ought to
be governed, what forces were meet to finish the war, described the kingdom,
praised Tarif, and advised Almanzor himself to come in person to take the
posession of his Conquest Although that Tarif had fully instructed his master
in all things that concerned Spain, ye^ Ismael was welcome t^ Almanzor, who
was never wearied to hear relations of his good successes gave satisfaction to
Mura by Letter, and stayed Ismael employing him in April 715/94 in an
Embassage to the King of Tunis as well to condole with him the necessary death
of his son (who was executed in Spain) as to crave his daughter Omalhair in
marriage for his eldest son Abilqualit.

In July following Ismael returned with answered agreeable to Almamzor's heart,
for reward of which service he was made Aquaz^ de los Reges Moros which is
agreeable in power with the President of Castile.

For the peopling of Spain with Moors Almanzor published proclamations
through out his dominions in Africa, that such subjects of his as would pass
thither with the families should have ^ands apportioned unto them at easy
rents, privileged with liberties, and exemptions; upon knowledge whereof five
thousand families of Moors and Jews were planted in Spain, where by in a
small time the Kingdom was so well replenish't, as that little sign of war
appeared.

The plague being ceased in Sivill Habdilbar the Governor (with an army of
12000 foot and 1000 horse) sat down before it. But the defendants valor
made him weary of the enterprise, and with the loss of much time two thousand
foot, and two hundred horse, he returned to Cordova. After some rest and new
provisions made, Habdilbar ashamed of the late soome he had received, and
fearing Almanzor's displeasure, matched the second time from Cordova to Sivill,
his army consisting of fifteen thousand foot, and fifteen hundred horse. But
the Christians not failing in courage bravely resisted, daily falling upon the
enemies quarters.

After forty five days siege, news was brought to Habdilbar that Elhardaly a
Moore governor of the Province and City of Valentia was revolted from his
obedience, with a purpose to usurp to himself the title of the King of
Spain; as he was sorry for this news, so was he glad of so good an excuse to
rise from before Sivill, having received more loss then formerly he had done.

Toward this Rebel Habdilbar with ten thousand foot, and eight hundred horse)
marched from Cordova strengthening his army with certain troops raised by the
Governor of Murcia. The rebel in the first encounter was defeated, taken, and
beheaded, the City of Valencia (for the Citizens offenses) sacked, and
Mahomet Abenbucar made Governor of that province.

Althongh Tarif by the spoils he had gotten in Spain, was esteemed the
richest subject in Almanzor's Dominions, and there with in Common opinion he
might rest satisfied, yet he like a grateful Prince to a well deserving
servant held himself bound in honor to lay upon him some visible mark of
favor where upon he made him Governor and Leivetenant General of all his
Kingdoms.

The time now drew on for the Consummating of the intended marriage between the
young Prince Abilqualit and the King of Tunis daughter. Tarif, with a fleet of
forty sail, was sent to fetch her; The King of Tunis, as he had reason to
think himself much honored to matched his daughter with the great Almanzor's
Heir, so he forgot not to demonstrate his affection by the rich Presents he
sent to the Calipha, and by the rewards he gave Tarif.

The Princes being arived at the Court, and the marriage Solemnized, Almanzor,
broken with age and infirmities, having lived Sixty three years, and reigned
forty two, he resigned his Scepter to his son Abilqualit, the third day of
October in in the year after our Redemption 716/95 and when all the ceremonies
incident to the Resignation and Assumption of a Crown were past, he retired
to asumptuous Monastery built by himself in the Mountains, for forty eight
Monastical men, Governed by a Morabits which signifies an Hermit, where with
an infirm body (Languishing for the space of seven years in continual
devotions) he died.

He that should write at large the story of this Prince, discourse his
glorious actions as they merit, set down his virtues, and anatomize all that
was good in him, should undertake a task of great labor; for had he been a
Christian, his equal could hardly been found, but his better impossible,
wherefore not to bury so great worth in oblivion it is not impertinent briefly
to say somewhat of him. In his tender years the hearts of all men began to
admire and affect him, as well for his person which in beauty, and form excelled
the children of his age, as for the goodness of his disposition, and sharpnes
of wit, which was admirable, as his years increased so did his perfections,
all virtues striving which should be predominant in him, which produced fear
and love in his subjects hearts evenly balanced toward him. His stature was
tall, and seemly, his gesture grave and pleasant; the thoughts of his heart
were not discovered in his brow, his limbs strong and active, valiant,
liberal, devot, wise and learned; being reproved by the king his father for
giving a way to the poor in one day by handfulls of Gold the some of 20260.
pounds [22 Arrobas and 13 pounds of Gold] for an instruction, told him that a
poor King was as a dead man among the living, he replied, that Avarice in a
prince was base and contemptible, that Kings in imitation of the Creator (by
whose power they rule and reign) ought to give to the well deserving, and
needy; heaps of treasure could not add one day to his life; and being dead
nothing but a poor winding sheet remained, which was not snfficient to arm
him against the wrath of God, unto whom at the latter day he must render an
account of his Actions.

To the King his father a rich Semitary of great price being presented, the
handle whereof was a rich Emrald the Pommell a ballast [or a stone called a
Balis] Rubie, the guard and scabberd of beaten gold set with precious stone,
and the blade a Damaskin [the blade most excellent damsked] of excellent
temper; for the rareness of so precious a Jewel showed it to diverse of his
great men, who admired the perfections they saw, but found fault that the
weapon was somewhat too short; whereat the young Prince smiled, saying, they
were deceived, for the shortness of a good sword in the hands of a valiant man
that dares come up close to his enemy was so far from defect, as it brought
advantage with it: the king pleased to see in so tender years so bold a spirit
in his son, fastened the sword to his side, saying that he only did merit to
wear it that found no fault with it: Before he was 21 years old, he wrote
diverse books of the Mathematiques, Astrology, art of War, Philosophy,
policy of state, and a large comment upon Aristotle's works [three books of
Philosophy upon the tents of Arist: in form of a Co^ment] he could perfectly
write and speak eleaven several Languages, expressing his mind, and
answering Ambassadors in them with out the help of a Truchman, his father being
old, joying in his sons perfections, upon the tenth of January 654 resigned his
Scepter to him, which addition of greatness bred no other Alteration in him,
then a greater desire to increase in goodness, his Ambition striving no less to
be reputed virtuous then to keep and enlarge his Dominions, his aparell
ordinarily was plain; but on festival days no prince more sumptuous At his
meat, which for the most part was private, he seldom had above two dishes, and
that but once a day, two servants to attend him, and never drank in gold, or
silver cup though of them his officers were royally stored, Surfetters, and
Cormorants he compared to beasts void of reason. Toward the Evening his Major
Domo had access to his presence to inform him of the disorders in his house,
if any were; which instantly were reformed: For relief of poor suitors, meat
was daily provided to suffice 200 persons; and a place in his house assigned
for them to resort unto, winter or summer, except he were sick; he was ready
before Sunrise, yet never slept in the day for a preservation of health; he
bathed often in his Listine. He was never known to make a Ly, nor to his
knowledge spoke an untruth, he termed Liars disciples of the Devil, the plague
of the world, betrayers of truth, destroyers of Conversation, and the right
hand of iniquity, no man that lied unto him escaped unpunished but received
his punishment answerable to the weight of his Ly, the least was onblik
disgrace, but lies of moment he Chastized with whipping, cutting of tongues,
banishment, disabling to be witness, and in some case life was taken, which
rigor bred terror in wicked dispositions, and restrained false information, and
unnecessarie suits, the days of the week he designed in their order to their
proper distributions, and every of them (when urgent occasion enforced not the
contrary) were daily observed.

The Friday which is the Arabians Sabbath he spent in devotion, never missing
his hours in the Mosquetaes, his progression thither was solemn, attended by
his chief Alcaydes, Counselors, and officers, and the guards of horse, and
foot; when prayer was ended, not far from the Mosquetas, set in his royal
seat, he remained a good space to receive petitions, the poorest not being
debarred his presence; before he departed, an officer, or cried with a loud
voice gave notice to the suitors to attend the next morning at the Court of
Justice where they should receive answer.

Upon Satterdaies, personally, he sat in Judgment, the chief Justice produced
the petitions exhibited the day past, which being read, and the suitors
questioned withal, who durst not aver an untruth, the causes were ordered;
where difficulties did arise such were referred to his Council, but the
longest delay never exceeded fifteen days. In cases criminal Sentence at the
farthest was pronounced within nine days. Suits of debt had the expedition,
but where it appeared that the debtor was rather faulty by accident then by
his defaults, the king oftentimes out of his own treasury would pay poor men's
debts. His severe punishing of lies, bred the expedition of Justice: for
untruths were never suggested, whereof ensued quietness among his Subjects, and
few suits. The like severitie he exercised among thieves, never sparing the
lives of the guilty; whereby in the end his subjects for fear of his Justice
were so terrified, as if any thing had been lost in the high ways, or in the
streets, the party that first saw it [this custom was used among the Moors of
Granada even to our days and seems natural to them] durst not touch it
before he had some witness to testify that he found it; and that done, placing
it in view of the world publicly relating where he had it, that the owner
might have knowledge thereof.

The Sundaies were assigned to determine Martial affairs, of that Council he
had but four, the eldest Councellor presented the dispatches of the
Leivetenants and generals that were employed in service, and after snfficient
debating, the answers were referred to him to be engrossed: when he resolved to
enter into a new War, he advised only with him that should be General of his
landforces, and his Admiral, saying that all others were needles being their
offices to obey, and execute. The first day of his consultations was only to
hear what they could object against his propositions, the second what men and
Munition were needful, and how to dispose of them; the third, and last was to
give directions to officers to put their Counsels in execution; He ordained
that his General by land while he was upon the Sea, should be commanded by the
Admiral, and upon the shore the Admiral to obey the land General, he never
bestowed charge, or office upon men of War, although they were of good merit,
that sued for them; Places that were void, he conferred upon worthy men
recommended by his General. Parentage and Allies wrought no partiallitie, in
him merit only prevailed, of all his men of war that were of note, he ever
kept a List, and caused memorialls to be abstracted of their time spent in the
wars, their particular services, places of birth, and dwellings; He was of
opinion that before all others they were meetest to be preferred to great
places as well in peace as war, for they had the strongest spirits to execute
Justice, their experience best knew the humors of all sorts of men, whereby
their judgments were ripened, the miseries which themselves had felt, gave
them a true feeling of poor men's wants. They which knew how to win, and defend
kingdoms, in reason should be best able to hold them in obedience: and
concluded that valiant men were more sensible of honor, honesty and
reputation; and prized those attributs at an higher rate then any other
condition of men whatsoever, whereof, of some of those he ever made his election
when Offices fell void.

The Mondaies were ordained to advise upon the Civil government of his
dominions assisted only with four Counselors, the eldest Councellor presented
the causes unto him, to whom the dispatches were referred, and the same day he
gave public audience to all that had just cause to complain of Civil
Magistrates: If the information were false, the informers were severely
punished, if true, the magistrates were not spared, and which of them was but
once justly proved to have been corrupt, no mediation of friends, or promise of
amendment could make his peace, but evermore disabled to bear office.

The Tuesdaies he assigned for Hawking, and Hunting, and dyned in the fields
publicly amongst his Courtires, and huntesmen: after dinner he would sit at
his Tentdoore, permitting the poor to resort unto him, and with his own hands
bountifully dispense his Charity, but especially to the fatherless Children,
and widows, never refusing to give liberally for God's sake to any person, not
demanding whether he were Christian, Moore, Jew, or Gentile. Once it chanced
he lost his Company, and meeting with a poor faint Creature, which in his
sight with weakness sunck to the ground, the king alighted, set him upon his
horse, and walked two leagues by his stirrup holding the raines, and brought
him to a house where he commanded that he should be attended, till he was
recovered; the poor man having knowledge who it was that had done him that
service, amazed, craved pardon thanking him for his Charity: Thank not me said
Almanzor, but the sovereign Creator who ordained me to meet you, for I have
done but that which was my duty to the distressed.

The Wednesdaies he gave himself to Music and rest in his private lodgings,
where also he had Artificrs that wrought in silver, gold, copper and iron, in
whose Arts he took delight, and with his own hands could perform Curious works.

Upon the Thursdaies he conversed only with learned men, hearing them dispute,
and argue upon such propositions as he offered; when any doubts arised himself
would turn the books, and moderate their disputations, that day they dined
with him, and when the questions had been sufficiently disputed; he gave them
at their departure new propofitio^s for them to think upon against the next
thursday.

To understand the humor, and disposition of his people, and his officers
integrity he would many times go guised into the City in the habit of a
priest, soldier, beggar, or Merchant [It is to be noted that in those days
the Arabians used to wear vailes over their faces] speaking freely of the
King, and his officers and soothe the company he was in; whereby he informed
himself both of his own faults, and theirs, which being discovered, held his
subjects in general in such awe, as when three, or more were talking together,
it passed for a byword, Take heed least Almanzor hear you, he was such an
enemy to idleness, as that he was ever busied in some virtuous exercise, and
made a law, that all snch persons of what condition soever did not spend their
time in some profitable, or laudable Art should be reputed infamous; he built,
and finished in his life time five hundred and six principal Mosquitas,
eighty and two Hospitalls, and as many Colleges for scholars, endowed them
with great possessions, every year at his own charge he bestowed in marraige
one thousand maiden Orphants: the alms he gave was admirable; by land and sea
he won 86 battails, in 13 of them, he was personally present, and in them he
took five Kings prisoners and slew one, the spoil evermore was indifferently
divided amongst the soldiers, the widows, and children of the slain had
their shares reserved for them; in his library after his death there was found
fifty five thousand seven hundred twenty two volumes of books, [containing in
wrighting one thousand two hundred nineteen Quintals of paper, each Quintall
being an hundred weight] to get that mass together, he proclaimed throughout
his Dominions, rewards to such as could present books which he had not wherein
his bounty exceeded: at last broken with years, and infirmities, and residing
in his Monastery sometimes he would admit his ancient servants to visit him.
His discourses for the most part were either heavenly contemplations, or of his
son, desiring above all earthly joys to hear that he were a good, and a
just king; his sickness increasing he sent him admonitorie Letters advising him
not to presume upon his regal estate which was frail, subject to mutation,
within Limits, vain, unasured; to humble himself to the Creator, God eternal,
by whom kings were ordained, whose power was infinite, everlasting and
supreme. That above all things he should be careful to administer Justice
without partiality, and avoid severitie, wherein he should imitate the King of
glory, who was goodness it self, and from whom all our good works did spring;
if he swarved from his rules, his Justice was Injustice, his Clemency
tyranny, his Charity avarice, all his actions wicked: That he ought not to be
ignorant that his wisdom was but foolishnes, his mercy extended but to
externe things, pardoning of sins was not in his power; his Justice streched
no farther then corporal afflictions, over men's souls he had no power:
Therefore he wished him not to glory in his earthly greatness, to contemplate
upon the humane miseries whereunto all flesh is subject, and that neither his
vast Empire, or Kingly power was able to draw one drop of rain from the
Clouds, nor to make a green leaf, or free him from wordly vexations. That he
should evermore think upon his end, remember that he was a miserable, and
wretched sinner, that after this life he was to render an exact account unto
the Sovereign King, the Creator of all things, and that the account of Princes
were greater, and more fearful then meaner men's; which duly considered, he
must conclude that neither himself, his dominions, or power were to be
esteemed precious: He admonished him to beware of pride, calling her the right
hand of the devil, the path of perdition, the nurse of sin, the gate of hell,
and the principal hook wherewith the infernal spirit draws miserable Souls
into his burning lake: he willed him to tread her under foot, and not to
overjoy in his death; For if Kings had the true feeling of their duties, they
would rather mourn and fast at their Coronations, then feast and triumph as is
accustomed. That he should no time make, or bear with a Ly, for Liars, are
devils in flesh, enemies to truth subverters of justice, fyrebrands of
sedition, causers of rebellion, destroyers of kingdoms, and to themselves thus
much harmefull, that when they speak truth they are not believed; Lastly he
admonished him to perform the service of God before all his other actions, to
adore him in singlenes of heart, and humility, to be just, in judgments,
charitable, and in his ways direct, and then he might be sure, that God would
bless him both in this world, and in the world to come, [from his house of
Albasadin the twentieth day of Rageb anno 96.] Although he felt his disease
incurable, yet the Physicians ceased not to put him in hope of recovery, after
some reproves he thanked them for their endevors but said he, the days of men
are limited, and the will of God must be obeyed, your learning and practice
connot add unto me one days life, beyond the prefixed day wherein I must die;
From the beginning of my sickness I knew my disease was mortal it is a vanity
to speak of impossibilities, I cannot live, and I thank my God that deilivers
me from the calamities of this miserable world, which said; he commanded his
sons Abilqualit, and Abrahen [the Infant Abrahen] to be brought to his
presence whom he admonished to live in brotherly love, that their concord would
be as a wall of brass in their defense, that their dissension would hazard the
dissolution acquired by him and his Ancestors; and turning his speech to his
youngest son. I Command you said he upon pain of my malediction to reverence
and obey King Abilqualit your brother, honor and serve him, in stead of me as
your Father, and Lord. Then casting his eyes upon Abilqualit required upon the
same to love and cherish his brother. Then causing himself to be raised in his
bed, he sent for his kinsmen, great officers, and servants unto whom he made a
large speech of the miseries of this life, of the eternal joys he was going
unto, and prayed them to let him know whether he were indebted unto any of them
for rewards, or otherwise, that he might take present order for their
satisfaction, and also humbly besought them, that they would forgive him all
his offenses toward them, as he freely pardoned them in all wherein thy had
offended him; for God said he will never at the latter day extend his mercies
to the merciless; and further as an argument of eheir loves toward him, he
entreated them to be at his funeral Then calling every one by his name they
kissed his hands and departed, his next care was to dispose his goods, Jewels,
and plate, which he commanded to be sold, and given to the poor (his books
excepted) which he gave to Abilqualit with Condition that he should marry one
thousand Orphants giving to every of them in dowry one thousand miticules. He
likewise freed all his slaves, and never after that was known to cast his
thoughts upon worldly business, the rest of his days he spent in contemplation,
and prayer.

Abilqualit presently after the possession of the Crown like a wise Prince, [
Abilqualit followed his Father in governmnt to admiration: Save only in his
Liberalytie and Charitie] was careful to settle his estate; his greatest
fear, was the stirring spirit of his brother Abrahen. To give him some
contentment (without peril to himself) he gave him the government of Arabia
Petraea; a small Province, poor, weak and steril: But contrary to his
expectation (before he was warm in his Seat) Abenbucar Governor of Damasko
rebelled, in hope to win the Garland. Against this Rebel Abilqualit, with a
huge Army, put himself into the field. Abrahen, taking hold of occasion,
under color to assist his brother, levied forces, and marched directly to his
Court (where according to his quality) he was received and served by the Kings
officers; being in possession of the house, he set guards upon it, seized the
movables, committed the persons of the Queen and young Prince to safe keeping,
and some principal men (toward whom he stood ill affected) were executed;
which done, by fear, flattery and reward, he was proclaimed and crowned King.

To second and assure his fortunes (leaving sufficient Garrisons in his Palace)
he marched after his brother, whereof when relation was made to Abilqualit, he
left the pursuit he followed and retreited; within a few days the Armies
lodged near together; the King unwilling to hazard his undoubted right in the
chance of battle, and moved (as he pretended) with Compassion, to save the
lives of his natural subjects, he sent to his brother Abrahen to entreat him
to co^miserate the public estate of the Monarchy, which (by their
dissentions) was in peril of ruin, to pity the lives of so many men and
good subjects which were like to perish, and if he would dissolve his Army, he
promised not only to pardon all past offenses, but impart to him such a
proportion of his kingdoms, as might give him satisfaction. Whereunto Abrahen
returned answer that he came not thither to treat, but to fight, and that
nothing but the sword should arbitrate between them, admonishing the messengers
to return no more, for whosoever brought him proffers of composiotion should
die. The next morning the twelfth of November in anno 717/90 the Armies joined,
Abilqualit was beaten and fled, never looking behind him until he came to the
sea coast, where in a small Pinnace he passed to the kingdom of Tunis, putting
himself into the protection of the King his father in law, when notice was
brought to Abrahen that his brother was escaped, by easy journies he retired
(the way he came) to Zarvall in Arabia, where the second time (for a
confirmation of his election) he was crowned. After some rest (his domestic
and public affairs being ordered) with a small Army of fifteen thousand
foot, and fifteen hundred horse, he marched toward Abenbuchar the Rebel, who
put into the field twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse, plentifully
furnished with warlike provisions. When the armies approached in view of one
another, Abrahen sent messengers to Abenbuchar to persuade him (not having any
pretense to the Crown) to desist from his treason and yield him obedience, and
he would both pardon him, and advance his fortunes. Answer was returned that
he, which had borne Arms against his natural brother, and sovereign, and out
of his proud Ambition had wrongfully torn the Crown from his head, was an
infamous traitor; for his particular, he was moved in conscience (being
Governor of Damasco) to defend the people committed to his charge from
insolences, and oppressions, wherewith they were daily vexed by the evil
government of Abilqualit. He understood not how men by natural right should
challenge succession in Kingdoms. That Scepters appertained only to such as
God blessed with valor, and wisdom; to those only, power and dominion was due,
and to none other, and therefore he would not desist from his enterprise.
Abrahen transported with choler, although he was dissuaded by his Captains not
to try the fortune of a battle obeyed passion, and paid the price of his
folly, for his army was routed, his men for the most part slain, his baggage
made a prey to the Mountaniers, and thence disguised (by by-waies) with many
perils, and sad thoughts he recovered his Palace in Arabia, where within
fifty days he listed under co^manders, and Captains forty thousand foot,
and five thousand horse, and with admirable expedition marched toward
Abenbucar who nothing dismayed, drew to the field with an army of thirty
thousand foot, and three hundred horse; with equal courages their forces
joined, Abenbucar defeated and taken, was presented to Abrahen, who in fury
(without speech) seized upon him and in the presence of all his troops with
his own hands cut his throat and smoat off his head, which he caused to be set
upon the chief Port in Damasco; his skin pulled off, and stuffed with straw
was placed by it, and his body left to be devoured by birds, and beasts, all
the chief commanders that followed Abenbucar were likewise executed, and
Abentirix (one of his favorits) was left to govern Damasco, which done, in
triumph he returned to Arabia.

Whilst these combustions continued in the East, Abilqualit at Tunis prepared
for the war, Mura Governor of the Moroccoes was sent for, who leaving an Arab
of Arabia Petraea for his Leivetenant, with thirty thousand foot well armed,
store of Munition and treasure repaired unto him; the second day of march in
anno 718/97. Unto the which the King of Tunis added his forces in number little
inferior to the other. The office of the Leivetenant General was conferred
upon Tarif, in whose wisdom, valor, dexterity experience and fortune,
Abilqualit did repose much confidence. In imbarking his troops he lost no time,
and favored with a westerly wind, and fair weather, they arived in Syria. The
rumor of Abilqualit with a powerful army being noysed throughout the
Country, from all parts multitudes resorted unto him, his forces by the book
of Checque appeared to be sixty five thousand foot, and five thousand horse.
Abrahen fearing his brothers forces, was not in provident to defend his
wrongful posseffion, and to that end, with incredible celeritie, he armed to
the field sixty thousand foot, and horse. In the constancy of his people he
was somewhat diffident, wherefore to confirm their hearts unto him he spared
not to promise large rewards, to lay before them their perils (if his brother
were victor) and concludes that it were much better for them to die then over
live their honors: the third day of November in the year aforesaid, the two
brethren, with drawn swords, disputed their right, the rivers were dyed with
blood of the dead that fell on either part, the battle continued from morning
till Sunset: Abrahen slain, his Army broken, and every man sought the best
he could for safety, whereunto the favor of the night gave good advantage. As
Abilqualit had reason to joy in so great a victory, so did he grieve at his
brothers death, whom he coveted (in the love he bare to him) rather to have
been his prisoner, then to have seen him dead. In mourning garments with
tears he followed his Corpse to the Funeral, his Co^manders, and Captains did
the like, and was in pomp interred with his Ancestors in the City of
Zarvall. In this battaill also Tarif received a slight wound in the arm
whereof he died, to do him honor Abilqualit in black attended him to the grave,
wept over him, and laid him by his brother, these funerals ended, with a
wrathful heart (in another form) he performed others, causing execution to be
done upon the chiefest that ran his brothers fortunes, the rest were
pardoned, and having ordered his affairs (lately distempered) lived in peace.

In Spain the Governor Habdilbar (by Commandment of his King) prosecuted Don
Pelago; to be informed of his strength he hired a Renegado Spaniard to view his
forces, order, and abiding places: but taken by Don Pelago's guards was brought
to him and tortured; yet his wit and constancy quit him of suspicion, and being
freed he returned to Cordova recounting to Habdilbar his perils, and discovery,
assuring him that Don Pelago was weak in men, and Arms, and victuals; that is
strongest places were not dificil to win, and that the Christians were full
of fear; upon trust of these relations, the governor selecting out of his
garrisons twelve thousand choice foot (for of horse there was no use) marched
toward the Mountains. All the force that Don Pelago did make, exceeded not
obove two thousand, with these he resolved to make the best defense he might,
and reposing more confidence in his wit than in his sword, he divided them into
many parts placing them upon straits and advantage of ground, yet so as they
might upon all occasions second one another, in the very first encounter which
was in a boggie wood full of rocks (formerly possessed by the Christians and
where an army could not march inform) Habdilbar was beaten put to a running
retreit, and lost two thousand besides hurt men and prisoners, wherewith
enraged, to ease his Choler he hanged the Renegado Spy and in despair to
prevail against men that were inhabitants in such inaccessible grounds
(fortified by nature) he lost the enterprise till a further time, and returned
to Cordova.

Abilqualit living in peace by an unlooked for accident was drawn into a new
war which arose by the death of his father in law the King of Tunis, who
deceasing without any other heir than his daughter Omilhaire (Abilqualit's
wife) that kingdom in right did appertain to her. Upon the report of his
death, the Arabian Monarch sent one of his great Comma^ders Abenmarchan in his
name to take possession of the Realm, which without contradiction was
effected, and the principal subjects swear their allegiance to him in the name
of Abilqualit, proclaming him King; for a few months, no disturbance appeared,
until one called Haaken next heir male in blood to the deceased king
(repyning that the kingdom should fall to a distaffe, and thereby in subjection
to a stranger) valuing himself worthy thereof, by promise of reward, and
underhand means (alured many of the best quality) to approve, and favor his
claim, his first enterprise was acted upon the person of Abenmarchan the
governor, in assaulting his house, and killing him and his servants, and that
done proclaimed himself King unto whom obedience was sworn, Abilqualit having
advertisment of his rebellion, dispatched a Post the second of April 719/98 to
Mura his governor in Moroccoes (with such forces as he could make) presently to
repair unto him, who (with extreme expedition) embarked twenty thousand horse
and foot armed, and victualled, and shortly after arived in the port of Vaffa,
in Syria, where Abilqualit had drawn to a head twenty five thousand foot, and
eight hundred horse, with these troops (over whom Mura was ordained Leivetenant
general) the king in person put himself to Sea, and with favorable weather
landed in the kingdom of Tunis. To withstand the Assailant, Hacen (the
usurping King) leavied forces consisting of forty thousand foot, and eight
thousand horse: In the first encounter Abilqualit's loss was more than Hacens.
Among others of note Ismael (the son of Mura) was wounded to the death, for
which disaster Abilqualit being pensive: Sir said the noble Mura (his father)
my son came not hither for spoil; to win honor and to do you service were
his ends, if he die it imports not much: for being borne to dye, his days are
crowned with glory in finishing them where your eyes are witness of his valor.

The day following being the ninth day of October 121/100 the Armies joined,
Hacen was overthrown, and Abilqualit in triumph made his entry into the City
of Tunis; but not accompting his victory complete (except Hacen's son were
in his possession) he proclaimed large rewards to him, or them that could bring
him alive or dead. Miserable Hacen (driven to extremities) was glad to cover
himself in a desolate Cave, where being bayed by Shepherds dogs he was
discovered, taken, and brought bound to Abilqualit. Instead of humility (the
inherent quality to unfortunate men) he used unreverent speech, which
breeding passion in the Conqueror, produced Tyrannical effects, in impaling
him upon a stake, whereon after five days torment he dyed, the men of quality
that assisted Hacen being executed, the Country settled, and Abrahen Hacen left
governor: Abilqualit sailed to the Levant, and tryumphantly returned to his
City of Zarvall, where resting himself but a while, he went in devotion to
Mecca to adore the Sepulcher of Mahomet. In his journey homewords through the
deserts, the sands, moved by wind, buried three thousand of his train,
himself, and the rest escaped with great danger.

The year following Almanzor (consumed with languishing diseases) [the third
day of the Moon Rageb in the hundred and second year of the Hixera] in anno
domini 723/102 died being the seventith year of his age, the forty one of his
reign, before the resignation of his Crown, and the seventh of his
Monastical life: of whose death as soon as Abilqualit had knowledge, he
dispatched messengers to all the great officers throughout his dominions to
give them notice of it, that according to the accustomed manner (in the like
occasions) they should command blacks to be worn (by the better sort of
people) in all Cities; pray for his Soul and give alms. He was buried in the
Mountain of Nue in a sumptuous Mosquita built by himself in a vault of Jasper,
able to contain forty persons sustained with pillars of guilt Alablaster, and
garnished with precious stone. The King his son, his kinsmen, his officers, and
Counselors, the chief Priests, fifteen thousand other priests, his household
servants, Courtiers, his guards and an infinite multitude of common people with
tearie eyes and mournful hearts attended his funeral, upon his Tomb this
Epitaph ensuing was enscribed.

Here lies the terror of Christians, Moors and Gentiles, who furrowed the
Seas, levelled the Earth, subdued the nations of the world, the Pattern of
Courtesy, the Tree of Mercy, and to the wicked the edge of Justice. Here he
lies that had a bountiful hand, the defendor of the poor, the father of
Orphans, the protector of widows, the mirror of Charity, honesty shame
facednes and modesty, the model of government, the Treasury of Nobility, the
maintainer of truth, the enemy of Lies, the lover of wisdom; whose fame shall
eternally live (for a worthy Monument to future age) in despite of Conquering
time that burns in oblivion the great actions of Princes Kings and Emperors.
Let us pray to the Creator that his glory may be endless, that in imitation of
him Monarchs may govern their states in peace and that he would be pleased to
direct our ways in his service, and fill us with his divine grace.

Abilqualit, being for two years together free from rebellion, and living in
blissful peace, after the example of his father, and Grandfather resolved in
his life time to settle the Crown upon his son Jacob Almanzor, a child of
tender age, and to that end the first day of March in anno 725/104 he assembled
all his great men to his Court at Zarvall, who approving his intent, swear
there obedience to the Prince as to the rightful snccessor of that ample
Monarchy. The form used in the Ceremony ensues. Abilqualit Clothed in royal
Roabes, with Crown and Scepter, his Kingly ensigns, majestically sitting in
chiar of estate, his son upon his right hand, and the high priest upon the
left, his Princes and guards being assembled, the high Priest with a loud and
audible voice declared the cause of summoning that royal Court, demanded
whether they were contented to swear their future obedience unto the Prince,
they answered yea. Then said the high priest, in testimony that you have
assented, all of you must do as I and the king will show you, thereupon the
King rose, set his son in his Chariot; the Prince in token of his filial
obedience kissed his Fathers right hand, the father blessed his child, and
after in humble reverence kissed his hand, and sat in his sons seat: the
high priest, and (after him) all the great men, falling at his feet did the
like; then a priest apparelled in a Ceremonial habit upon a board (in the
midst of that assembly) laid the Alcaron; the high priest rising from his
seat, demanded whether they were all content to swear by the living God and
the holy contents of that book, to maintain and defend Jacob Almanzor to be
lawful heir and successor to his father, King Abilqualit, in all his kingdoms
and dominions, whereunto they answered content; the high Priest replied,
whosoever does not constantly fulfill, and maintain his assent here given, let
him be held a person infamous, a traitor to the royal Crown, and let the
vengeance, and malediction of the Sovereign God fall upon him, and his; the
assembly answared Amen. Then the King rose from his seat, kissed the book,
and laid it upon his head, and returned to his place; the same was done by the
high Priest and the rest; the high priest then turning to the Prince said. Your
Highness must swear by the most high and Sovereign God, and by the contents
of this holy book (as King and Lord of these kingdoms) that you will
administer and maintain Justice indifferently between your subjects, that you
will fulfill and preserve unto them all the privileges, and franchises (justly
^^^^^ted by the Kings) your predecessors where by they may live in peace
without grievances, the Prince said he would be sworn unto it, if you do not
said the high Priest accomplish your promise and oath, let that Vengeance and
Malediction of the high and Sovereign God fall upon you as upon him that is
perjured, the Prince replied Amen. Then the Prince rose from his Regal seat,
kissed the book, laid it upon his head, and returned to his place, where
pausing a little while, attended with all the guards in pomp, trumpets, and
musical instruments sounding: he rode to the principal Mosquita, prayed, and
returned to his Palace where King Abilqualit attended his coming. The next day
was spent in feasting, triumphs and other Martial exercises, the day following
they repaired again to the Chamber of assembly, where the high priest
demanded whether they were content to ratify and affirm the oath they had
taken, they answered, yea. Then the King Abilqualit, the high priest, and the
rest (according to their degrees) one after another with humble reverence
kissed the Princes hand, who giving them thanks the Ceremony ended.

Not long after, the king sickned, his disease grew strong, and the Physicians
skill too weak to remedy it; the tender years of his son required a
Governor, to which office by his testament, he made election of one of his
near men (in whose faith he reposed trust) called Mahomet Amzarij. Then laying
aside all wordly business, he conferred only with religious men, prayed
incessantly, died.

The Queen Dowager pleased with the air and seat of the Monastery where
Almanzor died removed the young King thither and in her motherly love staid with
him. The Kingly power was established in Mahomet Amzarij who finding himself
obeyed as king despised the estate of a subject, and resolved to set the Crown
upon his own head: the way unto it he conceived to be liberality toward all,
but especially to the great officers, governors of Provinces, and Captains; The
men of war being his Creatures the rest were easily to be wrought. Unto them he
was bountiful, and courteous, denying nothing sued for, and often giving
before it was asked. With this carriage he so enchanted their hearts, as his
party seemed strong, but yet actions of great weight cannot be effected
without advice and aid. The first man to whom he discovered his pretense was
Abenzulayman his creature, advanced by him to be one of the four Counselors
at war: but his heart detesting the horrible treason, used persuasions to him
to give over the enterprise, laying before his judgment the general love borne
to the young king their natural sovereign; the little hope of prevailing, the
intestine war, and the hazard which the Empire should run into, by it, and
that the murder of the King (for murthred he must be) would make him odious
unto all men, and not only divert the principal Governors hearts from him, but
raise the like ambition (by his example) in others to revolt and establish
themselves kings in their particular governments. Though the traitorly
Protector liked not the reply, nothing squaring to his end, yet he gave him not
over, hoping at last to win him to his bent, but he like an honest loyal
Patriot stiffly persevered in his disswasions; after many assaults, seeing no
end of the Protectors tentations, afflicted in his Soul to ease himself, and
give remedy to the danger which necessarily must ensue if he smothered it unto
himself, he resolved to breath it out unto Mura the Governor of the Moroccoes
(then being at the Court) and highly esteemed for his valor, wisdom, wealth,
and dignity, unto him he discovered the treason; to prevent it, they found no
other means so good, as to know what course the protector would take in the
execution thereof; wherefore it was agreed, that Abenzulayman should seem to
like of the motion, he repaired to the protector approved the design, who told
him that he had resolved upon poison, as the safest from danger, and least
subject to hurt, which was not by the other contradicted. Abenzulayman with a
heavy heart returned to Mura, and in detestation of the intended plot, they
resolved to take the Protectors life; but if they failed in the enterprise
(lest peril might ensue to the young king and his mother) Mura by consent went
to the Monastery to give her a foreknowledg of it; who at the first stood
fearfully amazed; but by Mura's stronger spirit received comfort, and he
poasted back to the Protectors Court. In this mean while, the Protector
attended his treasons, and sent the king for a present, a rich garment
imbroidered with pearl and stone artificially, and substantially poisoned.

The careful Queen, fearing what she found true, would not suffer the King
(who was glad of his new Coat) to put it on; but the same night fastened it
about a Greyhound, who in the morning was found dead swolth, and ready to
burst. The Queen, like a wise Lady, dissembled her just displeasures,
returned letters, and messengers of thanks both in the kings name and her own,
and earnestly desired him to make his present repair to the King about
business of importance, which could neither admit delay, nor his absence.
Against his coming guards were set upon the gates by whom he was taken, bound,
and brought to the Queen, where being charged of manifest treason (which could
not be denied) he was suffocated in a vessel of water; his dead body laid
upon an Ass and carried through the streets, a crier published the cause of
his deserved death Mura and Abenzulayman had their several hopes to succeed in
the Protector-ship; but the Queen foreseeing the troubles that might ensue,
either in joining them in commission, or to prefer the one before the other,
assumed the government of the King and his estate into her own hands, which
displeased neither. Mura highly rewarded, returned to the government of his
Provinces, and Abenzulaman had the kingdom of Tunis committed to his charge,
but died upon the Sea in his passage thither.

All things being in peace, and orderly settled, the Queen in her government
feared, and loved. The young king in perfect health suddanly (when no cause of
fear appeared) sorrow and discomfort tryumphed, the instrument of their
victory was a Spyder (which accidentally falling from the roof of the
Chamber) lighted upon the Kings face where he slept, and bit his eyelid, the
venom whereof infecting the blood, inflamed his face, and from thence dispersed
it self into the other parts, where getting the masterie, within seven days
he died, and the Queen the fifteenth day following with overmuch abstinence
from meat ended her life in sorrow.

The death of this young King was the ruin and utter subversion of the Sarazen
Monarchy, himself being the last of the great Almanzor's issue: yet he wanted
not kinsmen, but their titles were intricate and ambiguous, which stirred up
pretenders, amongst whom Abenhachech prevailing by his friends was Crowned King
at Zarvall whereof Mura in the Moroccoes having notice (and ancient malice
depending between him and the new king) sensible of his own power, assembled
his Leivetenants, and Captains, and by their unanim Consent, was proclaimed king
of the Provinces under his charge, which greatness of his was determined by his
death in anno 727/106 he left two sons tender infants, the elder not past
seven year old. Their Fathers Kingdom was torn from them, and divided by
four of his Leivetenant Governors, styling themselves Kings of their
Provinces, namly of Morocco, Fez, Suz, and Ducdo. The Governors of Tunis and
Sarsall (now Argier) set Crowns upon their heads and assumed the name of Kings.
Abentirix governor of Damasco, erected his province into a Kingdom, afterward
killing in a battle the new king Abenhachech was proclaimed king of the
Arabians and Monarch of the Moors; diverse other Provinces in the East revolted
and became Kingdoms. Habdilbar who had governed Spain many years) following
the example ^f Mura devored in his conceit that Monarchy; but the inferior
governors tickled with particular ambitions taking hold of occasion refused his
obedience, yet of Cordova he made himself King. And the Provincial Governors
of Granado, Valentia, Murcia, Castilia, Tolledo, Arragon and Biscay, erected
their governments into kingdoms, and in after times (by their dissentions)
many other petty places in Spain were so entitled, which gave advantage to
the Spaniards to recover their lost Patrimony detained by the Moors (from the
conquest made by Tarif, in anno 924/93) and not fully no gained until in anno
one thousand four hundred nintie two Granado was Conquered by Don Ornando
Catolico and Donna Isabella Kings of all Spain (Portugal excepted) of seven
hundred seaventie eight years.

This great Empire of the Arabians, Sarazens, or Moors, begun by Mahomet
increased for the space of one hundred and four years from East to West. It
contained more leagues then the Roman Empire, and that excepted without all
doubt it was the greatest that ever obeyed one Monarch. In Europe they had
Spain, the most part of France, the Islands Majorca, Minorca, Scicillia,
Malca, Sardinia, Corfica, Candia, Cypres, Rhodes, and all most all the rest in
the Mediterranean sea. In Italy, Puglia, and Calabria, and all the best
maretine towns in Greece. In Africa they possessed a great part of AEthiopia
the Kingdoms of AEgipt, Tunis, Argier, Tremeson, Ducdo, Fez, Suz Morocco, and
others. In Asia the three Arabies, Persia, Mesopotamia, Syria, the two
Armenias, most part of the lesser Asia, and all the kingdoms to the Eastward of
Persia, even to the river Indus, which ample Monarchy so largly extended after
the young Kings death, brake as Alexanders did. And as the Ambition and
dissension of his Leivetenants rent his Conquest into several kingdoms; so did
twenty seven Governors of the Sarazens Empire divided, and share those
Dominions among them. And as time reduced them to nothing, so were these
kingdoms, in so much as (at this present) there is not one powerful King upon
the earth that can vaunt himself to be derived from the Arabian blood, but the
King of Morocco; the rest of that Empire is now possessed, by Christians, Turks,
Persians, other Mahometans and Gentiles.

He never chose rich Tyrant to his Council nor abhorred the poor just man.

He never denied Justice to a poor man for his poverty, nor pardoned the
rich man for his goods.

He never left illness unpunished nor goodness without reward.

He never Committed to another Justice that was clear, nor dark judgment, he
never determined by himself alone.

He never denied Justice to them that demanded it, nor mercy to those that
deserved it.

He never did correct any in anger, nor promised reward in his mirth.

He never was charged with thoughts in prosperity, nor dispaired in
adversity.

He never opened his gates to Flatterers, nor laid his ears to Murmurers.

He never Committed ill for malice, nor any villainy for averice.

He ever labored to be beloved of them that were good, and to be dreaded of
those that were ill.

He ever favored the poor man and observed the just law of the godly.

THIS Writing of the life of Jacob Almanzor was finished in the Castle of the
City of Cufa, on the 4th day of the Moon of Rabek the first, in the 110th
year. Praised be God

Amen.
