LAVGH and lie down: OR, The worlds Folly.

Printed at London for Ieffrey Chorlton, and are to be sold at his shop, at the
great North door of saint Paul's, 1605.

To the Reader.
BY your patience, if you have leisure to laugh, and will take any pains to
Read, it may be you shall be fitted a penny worth to your humor. Here is no
matter of state, divinity, nor Physic, but, and so forth, such stuff, as
will give you occasion perhaps, when you have worn it out, to commend it to
your friends: it is no outlandish, but made at home, and nere the worse, for I
know no reason to bar any man of his wits, that can tell kindly how to use
them: There are so many excellent writers in high Poetry, and strange plots,
that poor men, who would do well, are afraid of every Scholar, for fear of
a scoff, and of him that has no learning, for lack of wit. But at adventure,
this is done: how well, I know not, but you that Read, may judge as you list,
there are changes in it enough to make a Play: but the fool in the midst may
mar all: whose part, let it be put upon my self, for too much prattle, I
care not, if I here take an order with my pen to make an end of an idle Epistle.

Your friend as occasion serves.

To his most loved loving, and well-beloved, no matter whom.
YOu Sir, hoping that you will take well, that is not worse meant, having
nothing else, to give you: I here present you with a book, vvherin, I have
written as you see, what it is you may Judge, a strange course of an odd
strain, in which if you find no matter to make you merry, feed fat with
your melancholy, till you be as mad as he that has no more wit, then he
needs to occupy: There are many passages, to little purpose, to him, that
understands them not, and yet he that has both his eyes, may see more then a
blind man: I hope you are none of them, if you be, God help you, for I cannot,
for though many can make lipp-salue, yet, vvit-salue is past my skill: precepts
there are none, for I do not keep a school, except it be of had-I-vviste,
and then if I should set up my bill, I should have too many Scholars: my
meaning was, to be merry with my self, and if in mine humor, I have made any
angry, if he cannot have patience, he must fret, till he be weary: such as
are wise, will smile at their conceit, and the fool, for lack of wit will
find fault, with he knovves not what. Ten, to one, I shall not please all
men, and Twenty to one, I do not desire it: yet, loath to displease any, I
leave it indifferently, to every one, intre^ing good minds to give it good
words, and for the (...) I leave them to their bad humors: So, loath to tell
(...) what follows, I leave my work to the cen^^^e of your Good will: and
so rest as I find cause.

Your loving Friend,

C. T.

The Worlds Folly.
WIthin the compass of the world there is an island, whose name I have not
read, and therefore I care not if I leave it out: now, in this I slande, were
diverse Towns, and Cities, among which, there was one greater then all the
rest, the name whereof, was written upon one of the Gates, but the letters were
so worn out that I could make no English of them: and therefore, least I
should do wrong to the inhabitants, to set it down by a false name, I will say
no more of it but that it was a fair city, and so leave it. Now in this
city, were many fair houses: but among all, one, of that bigness, that the
Lord of the Town had been able to keep his Christmas in it, it was full of
windows, for a man might look through it: and all the smoke of the house went
out in one Chimney.

There were to this house, three Gates; and all in a forefront, which showed
that it had the foundation of some Caitle: but by decaie, was brought to be an
Almes-house. Now in this Town were many sundry sorts of people of all ages;
as Old, and young, and middle age: men, women, and children: which did eat,
and drink, and make a noise, and die: but such as lived, had there, their
sundry lodgings, that they might quickly be found out, when there was occasion
of their imploymeut. The house was large, and the Governor a great Man: I do
not mean in fat, (and yet he was well lined in the Pursse:) but he had a
great command, especially of those about him: which because they were of small
wealth, there is little to be said of them: only they were Creatures that
served the time, followed Shadows, fitted humors, hoped of Fortune, and
found, what? I cannot tell you.

But at the entrance into the first base Court, where walking of Horses was the
chiefest exercise of Idle people: over the Gate, I saw written (Mad
Fellows) Now, asking the meaning thereof of an old Man (who was the Porter)
who had written upon his breast, The Calendar of Experience, he told me, this
house was called the Fort of POLLY, where such as sold Land and followed
Fortune, to teach them Patience after poasting, were put to walking of horses:
Where great spirits, stouping to little bodies, made misery a mean to
happiness: Where in the Cross of Patience, company gave much comfort: yea
but (quoth I) Do all walk Horses? and have they no other intertainment? yes
(quoth the Old man) within the house, are many, put to more unpleasing
services: As, they that have spent their patrimony upon Wantonness, are made
Pandars to wickedness He that lost his wealth at play, must hold the Candle
to Gamsters: and he that melted it in banqueting, must wait on a Churles
Trencher: and he that spent it in the Wars, must learn to pray for Peace.

Alas (quod I) I have been a younger Brother, and glad I would be to see
fashions, but if here be no better intertainement, I have no heart to go in any
further. Oh sir, quoth he, Content your self, you may do better then you are
aware of: For, if you have any extraordinary quality, here you may make a
gain of it: If you can make a Ditty to a tune, you may fill your belly for
your wit: If you can mende a decayed complexion, you shall be paid for your
color: If you can devise a new fashion, there are that will be for your humor:
if you can tell a strange tale, you shall be thought wise: if you can swthe a
lie, you will grow plausible: if you can manage the carriage of the Fool,
you may have savor in fair Eyes: if you can cheat at play, you may thrive by
tricks: if you have any languages, you may do good upon strangers. And if you
have the strength of the back, you shall not want necessaries of the Belly:
But whatsoever you do, beware of conscience for she is in little credit: Alas
quoth I then, what should I do here? For I had rather die, then live
dishonestly: Honesty (quoth he) whatsoever you think of it, speak not a word
of it. For in the course of Folly, a faithful servant is a good Ass: a kind
friend, is a sweet fool: A liberal heart is a fear of Beggary: and a
charitable man is a pitiful creature. And yet, howsoever they come here, I
know not, but our house is full of them, and therefore if you be as you say,
so scrupulous of Conscience, or so careful of Honesty, you were best make one
among a number here, then loose your self in a wilderness with want of
company. For here, you may be Beauties Fool, Wealths slave, or Wits ass,
or Prides vassal, Honors shaddowe, or Powers subject: you may be a Iester
among fools, a Iuggler among Gypsies, a Fortune Tellers among fair hands, or a
flattrer among fine Ears: and perhaps, if you can be wise, be nere the
worse for weldooing.

For it is no shame to honesty, to furnish necessity, so that the law do not
touch you, for I have lived long, and never saw a tempred spirit out of Tune:
and if you will be ruled by your friends, you may do well. The Mistress of
this house has no mean power in the world: for in the War, she has her
Mutiners: in the Schools, her Truantes: in the Court, her Prodigals: in the
City, her Minions: in the country, her Lols: and at Sea, her Pirates: and at
Land, her out-lookers. And let me tell you, that once a year, (how often
more, I know not) they all do her homage. The Cuckold hangs down his head:
the thief hides his face: the Prodigal fetches a deep sighe: and the Lover
with infolded arms, and (perhaps) a weeping Eye, singes a Ballad of his
Brainsicknes, to the tune of O man in desperation.

And therefore think not much, among so many of such reputation, to have a
place of Entertainment: Which, if you like not, and can mend your self, tell
me your mind, and I will help you in what I can: but, this I say, she is a
kind woman, and will give you countenance whenever you come: for she loves
Strangers exceedinglye, and entertaineth them most kindly. Alas (quoth I)
these words of yours are strange, I know not when to make of them: I am not
for her hand, except she have need of me in some better service, then I yet
here of.

Why (quoth he) let me tell you, it were strange, that you should spend your
wits, with your wealth, if the worste fall, let me tell you, if you can feed
an Owl, teach an Ape, or catch a Spaniell, I will warrant you pleas`d for your
pain. No (quoth I) imaginations of idleness, are but loss of time, and
therefore trouble not your self, I had rather never serve, then be at such
command: But, since Fortune has brought me hither, I pray you do for me,
what you can, that I may not so far loose my hopes, that I pay two dear for my
Repentance. I will (quoth he) come on thy ways: so in he brought me to his
great Lady: who in a great bravery, vaunting her self, asked me who I was? I
answered, a Cipher among figures: well said, (quoth she) more wit in the words
then in the matter: now, whence come you? From idleness, (quoth I) well,
(said she) that is the right way to Ignorance: Eperience, take this
fellow, to thee, and let him read the rules of Patience, which done, let him
know his place.

So taking leave of his Lady, he led me into a large Room, paued with rough
flint stone in the midst whereof, was a kind of standing water, that (when it
was sticced) gave a kind of sent, that would have kilde a horse: Alas (quoth
I) Father, what shall I do here? Why (quoth he) you must know, they that have
spent their wealth in perfumes, sweet waters, and delicate Odors, must first,
here have patience with a little unpleasing savor, for he that comes into
such a great house, as your Forte of Folly: must not look for all places,
after the finest fashion?

For he that cannot away with Sir Reverence, must not come at Patience: but
after you are a little used to it, you will easily away with it: Oh, Patience
is a virtue, though it wait upon many villains: but you must away with many
viscontentmentes, before you can be acquainted with the secrets of this house,
or have favor with our Mistress. Here, in this place, which is called the
Purgatory of ^^t^e, I must bring you acquainted with many, that have lodging
in this place, of whom you must have diverse instructions, touching the Rules of
Patience.

So, knocking at one dwre, comes me out a handsome man, but poorly
apparrelled, pale faced, thin hayzed, and low voiced: who, (with a soft
speech, as in a fear to wake some sleeping Children) badde us welcome, whom
the old man thus saluted: Scholar, I have this morning, met with a stranger,
whom I have preferred to my Lady mistress: who has given me in charge, to
instruct him in all things fit for him in her Service: now, knowing your
perfection in the first point of the Principalles of this Purgatory, I will
leave him for this day to your entertainment: He is Welcome (quoth he) so,
(leaving me till the next morning,) he went his may, and I (in a pitiful
taking,) was brought by this Anathomie of flesh, into the discomefort of
nature, where oppenning a little dwre, and that low, where we must stoop ere
we got in, there did I see (with much ado) through a huge Sea-cole smoke, by
a little light, that came through a hole, in the top of the house, a Room
filled with people of diverse humors, as well old as young, (but the
pittifullest of Creatures, that the Earth carried alive:) all sitting upon the
bare ground: some sighing; other groaning, some weeping, other wringing their
hands: and not one, but in one Agony, or other.

Now, what with fear, and what with Sorrow, in a kind of maze to behold this
map of mtserie, this poor wretch appointed for my Reader in the Rules of
Patience, while I expected some book or other, that he should fall to lay open
to such purpose: he brought me to them all, one after another, willing me to
note them severally, to give ear to their speeches, and to take notes of them
for my better memory.

So sitting down with him (as it were) in the midst of them, without any
regard, either of me or themselves, while melancholy so domineired in all, that
there was not a good humor among them: they thus began their black Sauntis.
One, who (it should seente), had been a trauailer, and now retired perforce,
from a world of Countries, fell thus to talk to himself. O Heavens, what a
Hell is this? Tire the body, spend the spirit, empty the purse, weary
friends, waste the wits deserve well, desire little, and have nothing: What
comfort on the earth, but death? Fortune is such an enemy to virtue, the
rolling stone gathers no moss, the vanity of variety settes the wits a
wooll-gathering, where the Sheep are worse then woolues, travail toylesome,
victual chargeable, apparel costly, company jealous, the sea dangerous,
and nature vicious.

These passages who has paste, and is come unto the end of his pilgrimage,
let him sing with me in this purgatory: Oh the wind, the weather, and the
rain. When shaking of his head, with a heavy heart, he put his tongue to
silence: when having learned by his travail, (having little money in his
purse,) to fare hard, he fell to break his fast now about dinner time,
with the pill of an orange, a raw root, and a little salt: which with a
hard cruste of dry biskette, and a cruze of cold water, he made his patient
repast: when, calling me to him. Sir (quoth he) if it please you, that you
will take part with a poor manne, welcome shall be your best cheer. A
trauailers Table is soon covered: I have been very well acquainted with
kick-shoses, but now I have learned to satisfy Nature with a little.

Alas, thought I, to take a bone from a Dog, I should starve the dumb
beast, and rather had I fast, then fall to such hungry fare. So, having many
more to look over, the next was a man of Middle age, who had binne a man of
some wealth: but, with entering into surety, and taking up Creditte, and
giving interest, fell so far to decay, by leaving his Trade to his Servants
charge, and followinge the course of his own Pleasures, satte there with a
needle and a thread, mending of Byreeches, Petticoates, and Stockinges: In
which, being so practiced, as got him now and then a little work, he had
standing by him, for meat and drink, a pot of strong Ale, which was often at
his his nose, that it kept his face in so good a color, and his brain in so
kind a heat, as forgetting part of his forepassed Pride, in the good humor
of grieuing Patience, made him with a hemming sigh, ilfauourdly singe the
Ballad of Whilom I was, To the tune of Tom Tinker.

This poor soul I pitied, but finding little matter in him, I went to the
next: who being an old man with a silver head, and a snowy bearde, hollow
cheeked. Iawe-fallen, and bleare eyed, shaking with the Palsy, and tormented
with the Stone, not so Rich, as to have the Gout, having been a man of some
possessions, and with too fat feeding of Horses, too high keeping of Hawks,
and too much delighting in banquetinges, through lack of husbandry, was
forced to leave himself without Land, and having no more money left, then in
soiourning with Patience, might pay for his bourde in this purgatory, having
in a little Box, an Electuarie, which, with a little spirit of the juice of
Grape, kept life and soul together; this poor man, talking to himself, of
the ungratefulness of the proud; the unkindness of the rich, the hatefulnes
of the wicked, the woe of the wan ton, and the misery of the poor, the
wilfulness of youth, and the wretchedness of age: after many a deep sighe,
with a hollow voice, in a solemn tune, with a heavy heart, fell to sing the
song of Oken Leaves began to wither: to the tune of Heavily, heavily.

Which poor soul had no sooner ended, but for his best ease, falling fast
asleep, to his good slumber I left him.

When next to him, sat a dapper fellow with a smarte countenance: one, who
(it seemed) in his youth had been expert in the Pass a Measure: but, for
want of a good ear to keep time, made no lasting commodity of his idle
quality. Now this fellows (as it seemed) had spent a great deal more then
his getting, upon the gay furnishing of an evil favored carcass, which
growing out of square with good fashion, and with some great cold after a heat,
in some extraordinary labor, having gotten the crampe of the iointes, sat
with a comb in his hand, dressing of hair to send to the Perriewigge-makers,
which being a very poor occupacion, got him little, but now and than, a
little broken meat after the houshoulde had dined: who after he had spit on
his fingers and wiped them on his patched breeches after dinner, in stead of
grace; fell to sing the ballad of the blind Beggar, to the tune of Heigh ho.
Now, taking no great pleasure in this Pawn at Chesse; I took note of the
next: who was a young man, fair of face, flaxen head, fine hand, and foot,
straight body, good leg, and a reasonable good countenance; but with all
this, it was pity he was a fool; for as I found after ward by him, he had been
a possessor of some small portion: which, through lack of a good forewit,
brought him into this purgatory of Folly.

For allas poor man, he had been so far in love, that he was almost out of
his wits, ere his wealth was half gone; and being brought to a bare point,
having no further credit with beauty, then cost, not able to mantaine the
course, was sains to give it over in the plain field: where so far forlorn of
all comfort, that he knew not where to bestow his little talent that he had
lost, fell by chance upon this forte, where, he now sat making of ballads;
where with a crust of bread out of his pocket, eating, and singing, he howled
out the dittle of When I was fair and young: to the tune of Fortune.

But to hear how he cursed the wenches that had (as he said) missused him
with fair looks, kind promises, and such tricks; oh fie upon them, a man is
worse then mad that has to do with any of them; and then, how he would
curse himself, for selling of his land, spending of his money, and loosing of
his time, if a man in that place could have laughte, it would have put him to
his passion. But there let him sing, and they that list buy his Ballads.

Now from him, I took note of the next, which was of the feminine Gender, one
that was once a virgin had been a little while a Maid, knew the name of a
wife, fell to be a Widow, and last of all, either through desire of change,
or mislike of choice, or the instinct of Nature, or the corruption of the
spirit, or want, or pride, I know not, but for want of a better trade, after
she had given over her shop, betook her to her Chamber: and there, not able to
maintain housekeeping with Idleness, fell to occupye such wares as were most
gainful: Where, having stufs of all colors, she so pleased her chapmen, that
for a while she had good resort: but many of them falling to decaie, her ware
grown old, and her stuffes common, she that had been a whore in her youth, and
a Bawd in her old age, was now become an Almeswoman, and lived upon a poor
pittance, when after many a deep sigh, and bitter tear or two, she would sing
the Lamentation of a Sinner, To the tune of welladaye.

After all these, I saw a young woman, of reasonable beauty, indifferent good
countenance, and of stature not much amiss, who being in all her life none of
the richest, nor for her wit, none of the wisest: yet for that, she had a
conceit beyond all good understanding, that because a Knave for a fit of
Fie-for-shame or a companion, for gain of a little coin, would persuade her,
that she was wonderfully Fair, and exceeding wise, she, out of the great
lack of knowledge, in her little discretion, thinking, that if she, out of
the Common of two, should be of a better declension then a simple Creature,
persuading hirselfe that casting a Sheep eye at a Rams-head, the Horns
should not be seen, till the Ewe might avouch the Lamb, by the pride of a
few pence, often frequenting the Market, and meeting her Willers at the
Tavern, it fell out, that after an idle and loos life, by breach of promise of
one expense upon another, and ill dealing of all, having lost all favor with
her friends, love of her Kin, and the greatest part of her Portion, having
now nothing left, but a wicked face, and a worse body, a gowtie leg, and a
splay soote, fit for nothing, but a base exercise, she was now with a little
coin, in a leather pursse, a soul kerchiefe, a course Petticote, and a
clowted shoo, become a Laundresse to the house: where with her hands up to
the Elbowes in a washing-boul, rubbing up a baby-clowt, stood singing the
Ballet, of All a green Willowe, to the famous Tune of Ding, dong.

Now there were diverse others in exceeding badde takings: as Lusty, Gallant
youths, that had spent and made havoc of their Patrimonies, in attending
upon vain hopes, and loosing their times, exclaiming upon Fortune, growing
(even as it were) mad for lack of money, here in this place were let to
diverse Exercises, of whom the number was to be accounted very great, and
therefore I care not if I skippe them over: But yet amongst them al, there was
one, that I took a special regard unto: a man of a good personage, a fair
complexion, a quick wit, and a gracious spirit, who either for punishment of
his siunes, or for trial of his patience, had been married to a most vilde
woman: who, as she was neither fair, nor greatly well favored, yet, was she
most exceedingly foolish, and intollerably froward: one, whom nothing
contented, but money, which she knew not well how to use, when she had it, and
yet, with this piece of ungracious creature, had this poor man tugged out
twelve years of his life, when, being so continually wearied out with
unquietness, that he knew not where to bestow himself, after long loss of
time, expense of much money, and many a heactes grief, thinking no Purgatory
so full of pain, as the passion of her frowardnes, satte there, reading of the
virtue of Patience, when with his Eyes full of tears, and hart-broken sighs
he hummed out the Ballad of the Breeches, to the tune of Never more.

Now this man (after his song,) I had some talk withal, who told me, that of
all the Torments of the world there is none so intolerable, as the unquietness
of a froward wife. Oh she is like Thunder in his Ears, like lightning in his
eyes, like a Bear in his bed, and a dog at his Table, so that if there may be
a Devil in a humane shape, he will show himself in her picture: Oh quoth he)
I pray thee trouble me not with speakinge of her, I have grief enough to
think of her, for she was the plague of my youth, and is now, the misery of
mine age, for, in respect of her Pestilent tongue, this very Purgatory, is a
Paradise: she has been the loss of my credit, the cross of my Fortune,
the hurt of my wit, and the only vexation of my spicite: but peace (quoth
he) noe more words; for now she begins to awake, you shall see a proof
of my speech: when stretching out a mouth, as wide as half a world, after a
sleepye yawne or two, scarce well out of her dead slumber, (persmading her
self, that she had heard some part of her description) out she breaks into
her Natural fittes: With yea, I hear you well enough, a vengeance of all such
Husbands.

Good wife, said he, know where you are, have patience: Good Ass (said she)
Wherefore? What should one do with a Jack an-Apes that has neither wit nor
government; Thou haste nothing of a man in thee, hang thee Dog: Fie Sister
(said he) you are much to be blamed, neither beauty, nor honor, Wealth nor
wit, and yet out of Tune still. Fie, fie, learn to be Wise, this is a
Purgatory, where every body learnes patience, and you only spoil all:

A Purgatory indeed, said she, to be yoaked and matched with a Slave, as is
by no means able to maintain me, as well as others do their Wives: If thou
can not live, here is a knife to cut thy throat, go to the Sea and drown
thy self, or else unto the Gallows and hang thy self, I promise thee I care
not for thee: If I were well rid of thee, I would have thy betters, I have no
Trade to get my living, and therefore do as thou will or can, I care not:
Nay then (said she) if that so be you do not mend your manners, I shall be
enforced to leave you in your sleep: and when you are awake, see what your
mistcesse will do^e for you: and with that word, swelting with Anger, and
ready to foame at the mouth, taking out of her pocket, a Ballad of the
Tinkers wife that beat her husband: after she had grated her teeth, and
knitte her brows and made a wru^ging mouth she fell to reading, till she was
fast a sleep: where, he (not willing to wake hit) rose quietly away from her,
and with me stealing away from the company, brought me out of that Room into
another Room, more lightsome and comfortable, and yet, very pitiful to
behold, when the miseries there, were well considered: for, one that had been
in love, sat looking on his Mistress Picture, making such a leg to it,
writing such verses in honor to it, and committing such Idolatry with it,
that poor man, I pitied him: and in his behalf, sorrowed to see how the
Fool did handle him: but there sat he, hanging the head, lifting up the Eyes,
and with a deep sigh, singing the Ballad of, Come live with me, and be my
love: To the tune of adieu my Dear.

Next to him, sat a young woman, that was very fair, and indifferent wise, of
a right good stock, and reasonably honest: but, for want of a good purse, she
had lost her lover, and being grown into some years, having no excellent good
quality, was there set with a pan of Coals, a starch-pot, and a
setting-sticke, which being now the Trade of Attendance, to hope of the
preferment of marriage, to some fellow of more wealth, then understanding in the
world, there sat with her poting stick, stiffening of a fall: and singing the
Ballet of Fortune has stolen away my love to the tune of Green Sleeves.

To which song leaving her, I cast mine eyes upon a pitiful creature, which,
in the shape of a woman, made a pitiful sight: for, being both in proportion,
countenance, and quality, an object woorthe the looking on: yet no sooner
began she to utter her passion, in the method of lamentation, but, she did so
turn my heart in my belly, that if in hope of her better recovery, it had not
turn`d back: a thousand to one, but my kindness had cost me more then I should
have gotten by it: for, to tell you some part of her speech, (though it were
never in the Grammar) yet, being in the Rules of the Accidents, for the better
understanding of the Reader, I will set it down as I can remember it. Oh Lord
(quoth she) what plague can be greater to a woman, then to be married to a
Muskleboat, which never goes further then a cricke, to fish for a Frog, with a
Goose-net: was ever any woman in the world brought into such a hell? Oh let me
think upon my dingle dangle: in my bed, a log, at my table a Hog, in
discourse, a Baby, in judgment, an ass, and for all Imperfections, the
substance of worse then nothing, And yet, I must, and have, (but, will no
more,) done reverence to this monster, and been a servant to this slave, and
all, for a little money: but I have done, I will here rather pine to death, in
this Purgatory of Patience, then pass one day longer, in the Laborinth of
sorrow, to live with such a nonesuch, a fool? Why, I had rather be a beg gar
with true wit, then a Lady without true honor: but, since Patience is a medcine
for all Malladies, if he continue the coxcombe a little longer, I will fit him
a pennyworth to the purpose: and in the mean time, till I see him (which I
hope never to do:) let me sing my new Ballet, of the fine fool, to the tune
of Tarlton: wherewith pulling a paper out of her pocket, wherein was written
both the dittye and the note, she began like a Nightingall, to singe with a
voice, that if I had not known her to have been a Woman, I should have
thought her some better creature: but there let me leave her in her dumps of
Wella-day, and tell you further on, of my passage; taking a little view of all
these objects, nothing what I thought most needful, I took the company of my
friend, and came into an other Room, greater then that before: where I saw
diverse, sitting at a round table: and (as it were) at dinner: for every one,
had his Trencher furnished.

One, he fed on Flies, and Bees, which so stunge his tongue and bit him by
the lip, that he was forc`st to give up household, and leave all
hospitality, and study only to please the Lady of the Castle: but, while he
was in study, he fed still upon flies, that, (had not his throat been the
wider) he had been choked with a fly, insteede of some better fare: but
loathe to leave him, without some further knowledge of him: I understood, that,
he had been a man of some understanding, but, so carried away with conceit:
that because he thought himself wise, there was more hope of a Fool, then of
him, for true wit to do good upon? for, trusting to the compass of his own
capacity, so much, that he disdained better company, he was so cosened with
the cunning of wit, as, thinking to ouer-reach the Moon with imagination, he
fell through the clouds of Error, so low into the lap of Folly, as being
swaddled up, in her Babies bands, he must be very old, ere he recover his wits
again: but, poor wretch, there let him rest, and watch the Spiders web for
a fly, for I had no more to do with him: but the next to him, sat a handsome
woman, in shape, but, for her beauty, nointed with the curriers oil: and for
her wit, it was so natural, that Art had nothing so do with it, yet had this
unseemly creature, among better company, a kind of Pride, that she was worth
the looking on, till after great expenses of apparel for her filthy outside,
and fine diet for her foul chappes, she grew to so bare a reckoning with her
purse, that her portion must now be raised upon her qualities, which being
chiefly in her Needle, she was forced to be sparing of her diet, and make
layd-worke the greatest part of her living, whereof though she had her hands
full, yet Cut-worke being more in use, she was constrained to take exceeding
great pains for little profit: but having now new risen up from her work,
and set down at the Table, her meat was most chiefly on a fried Mouse, and
the reason thereof was, for that she being as watchful as a Catte, and as
broad eyed, and evil faced, never gotten without the consent, agreement, or
conceit of some such like Creature, it was a dish set before her to discipher
her disposition: and so let her sit, her neighbor with a fly, and she with
a fried mouse, like good fellows, or good Fools together.

Now, next her, sat a man, well stepped in years, but fine in apparel, and so
brisk in countenance, as if he had fed upon an Elixar, to recover the loss of
his strength, and he more strong in mind, then in body, to preserve the
smoothness of his countnance, to deceive the sight of a simple Eye, fed
only upon a Snayle, and so little at once that he kept an exceeding spare
diet: which, not being wholesome for all complexions, I meant not to meddle
with: but so, leaving him to his perilous dishe, took note of her that was
next him: who in the shape of a woman, was nothing pleau^ng to man: for as she
was old, (and therefore not Eiesome,) so was she froward, and that was
cumbersome: one, who in her youth had been so lavish of her kindness, that
now in her Age, she had nothing left but the contrary: and, where she might
have been commander of many friends, she now was grown to be an ouerseer of
Idleness: where being so busy, with a crabbed humor, that she was unfit for
good company: lighting amongst beggars, that would flatter her for a poor
reuersion, for want of a pair of spectacles, to lead the right way to her
grave, she fell, (by I know not what chance) into this Fort of Foll, and so,
in the society of these Fools, sat at this table of good fellowshippe: where
the most of her food, was of the clawe of an old Crabbe: a true Figure of her
substance: for her little Eyes, her crawling feet, and her scratching fingers,
the salt khewme, like the Sea water, and her grave, like a hole in the mudde,
where, after her going forward and backward, she went stealing of time to
little purpose, feeding upon the gain of young people, as the crabbe does on
little ashes, she was sweetly disciphered in her diet but, least I grow tedious
in her description, I will tell you of the rest.

The next was a nimble witted, and glib-toung`d fell low, who having in his
youth, spent his wits in the Art of love, was now, become the Jest of wit for
his looks were so demure, his words were so in print, his graces so in order,
and his conceits so in tune: that he was, yea Iwis was he, and that he was,
such a Gentleman for a Iester, that the Lady Folly, could never be better
fitted for her entertainment of all Strangers. The picktooth in the mouth,
the Flower in the Ear, the brush upon the beard, the kiss of the hand, the
stoop of the head the leers of the eye, and what not, that was vnneedefull,
but he had so perfect at his fingers ends, that every she, was my fair
Lady, and scarce a Knight, was, Noble Sir, the Tabaccopipe was at hand, when
Trinidado, was not forgotten: and then a Tale of a roasted horse, to make an
ass laugh, for lack of wit: why, all things so well agreede together, that
at this square Table of people, or table of square people, this Man, (made by
rule) could not be spared for a great sum. Now, his meat was most of a Goose
to which he had so much sauce, that it would have served for many dishes: but,
for that his talk, was to little purpose, and he himself but a picture of
Idleness, I leave him among his fellow partners, and will tell you onwards of
the next two, for the Table was fully furnished.

The next to him was a woman, I cannot well say much more of her; for her
beauty was worn out; her body was able to carry her limbs, her hands had
fingers, and she wanted not a tongue, which was the member she now made most
use of; for she would so praise my Lady, so sooth up my coosen, so magnify
my Lord, and be so pleasing to every person, that having lost much in her
youth by plain-dealing, she thought now to recover it by plain knauerie: but
meeting with such wits as met with her wiles, finding no place of worth,
fitting her unworthy company, for lack of better means to live, betook her
self to be a gossip among fools, where according to her quality, she was
served with tongues only for her diet: which tempred to so many Tunes, and
turning to so many matters, that it troubled my ears with the hearing of
them, I will leave her to her tittle tattle, and tell you a little of the
last, who was in shape a man, and not a man, I know not what to say of such
a man, for he had the eyes of a Calfe, the bearde of a Goat, the head of a
Water-spaniell, (meaning the hair,) the Ear of an Ass, the neck of a Bull,
the Nose of a bottle (or a Bottle Nose) and the lip of an Horse, the
countenance of a Dog, and the voice of a Hog, which being fed up for
Larde, was a huge piece of Fat, as for good and firm flesh he had but a
little.

Now, this ugly creature, who was scarce able to go from his bed to the board,
must there sit in a chair made of down quilt, with a pillow at his back, and
a cushion at his feet, feeding upon sweet Gelly, and laughing at a bawdy tale.
Now imagining by the Poets fiction, he should be GOD, or rather, Devil
Bacchus, loath to have to do with such loathsome creatures, I left the company
as they sat, and came into the next room: where, being brought in by my guide,
(the poor man, that was in miserable taking with a woman, I will not say his
wife:) there he took me by the hand, and setting down by me, willed me to be
silent, and only give ear to the discourses that I should here betwixt two
fools, that in loss of time, should lay open their imperfections: and what I
noted worth the laughiug at; to smile, and say nothing: so, after a few
friendly instructions for observations in that place, he sets behind a cloth,
yet not so close, but thorough a light sufficient to look on Folly, I might
see two goodly personages coming in, hand in hand, who having past some
complementes of common courtesy, sitting both down together, fell into some
kind speeches: and had not she been painted, Venus had been but a Blowse:
and had not he been pranckt up, he had been the shape of a handsome man.

But as they were like the Idols of Idleness, let them pass, with their
imperfections, and let me tell you a little of their tattle: he, as it fell out
for his turn, began thus to go about her: by this fair heaven: (O Lord
thought I, thou art I fear nearer hell but on, Did you know sweet Lady, could
you guess, or would you conetiue, the true, and faithful, and unfeigned,
hearty, inward, constante, and resolute and immovable love, (alas thought I,
what is here to do, the man's wits are out of breath, to spend so many words
about nothing, but let me go on) the love that I bear you, and only you, and
none but you, the Sun of my day, the light of mine eyes, the any of my heart,
and honor of my mind: (yet again quoth I to my self, what ails this poor
man, is he saying a lesson to his mistress? But a little further.) Then you
could not be so hard hearted, so cruel minded, nor so vninercifully disposed,
to grieve, to torment to her and to disquiet, this poor afflicted, woeful,
sorrowefull, and lamentable heart of mine. When, with a sigh he paused, and
said no more for the first part. Much ado I had to forbear laughing, but I
was glad, when he had done: expecting some worthy answer from her, who,
putting up her loose hatre with her hand, removing a pretty worm from his
place, with a silver Bodkinne, shaking the head, with a strange wincke,
setting a face fit for her speech, begun thus her reply. Oh sir, your words,
nor your wits, nor your wiles, nor your wits, nor your oths, (what is the
matter now thought I? But on) shall not deceive nor blind, nor overcome, nor go
beyond me, so far, but, I know, and perceive, and understand, what you mean,
and purpose, and intend, we I enough: (Lord help me, thought I, heers strange
Eloquence: but let me go further) but, I hope I will not be a servant, where I
may command, be bound, where I am at liberty, and be betrayed in my most
trust. (But then to hear the poor man, how he played the fool, it is pirty
that ever it should be spoken: but for the stories sake, let it pass.) Mistress
(quoth he) here is my breast, cut out my heart, see my thoughts: here is my
purse, take my gold: my whole state is at your service. (At these words my
heart began to tremble, for now the poor man is undone, for she will make
him a beggar, and then will he be a stark fool, but to go on, she took his
purse and his Jewels, and kissed his breast, and said) nay weep not, for I did
but try your truth, there shall be no love lost, and therefore, I pray you
only, be not Jealous of my looks to any other, for you only shall have my
love: and therwithall giving him a Judas kiss, she whippes a bracelet of
Pearl off from his Arm, with these words, this shall be your pawn, that I
will wear for your sake till to morrow: for ever mistress (quoth he) and all
that I have at your service; and I prate you mistress, grace me with your voice,
to a dittie that I have mede to the tune of, Lady, Lady, my fair Lady: A
vengeance on the fool thought I, it freakes me to hear him play the Ass: but
when I heard him fumble the strings of a Bandore, as if it had been the Back
side of a battle-doore, and her strain ^ut a throat like a Pigge, running to
a swill tubbe: I thought if the devil had daunced, there had been a Morris
for Hell: but, let them be, on the sudden they went away; and in comes
another couple; A man after the country manner, and a woman after the our
town fashion: he, no more wit, nor she, more understanding, then was fit
for the plough and the milk paile: And yet, these two (contrary to all Rules
of reason how it should fall out: fell, as it should seem, in love, for,
after they had sat down a while, and he had blow^d his nose, and she had wipte
her mouth, it came so about, that sitting together, he fell to her with these
words: Ienny, you know I am a man, as other are, and my name is Ienkin, so was
my father before me: and, though I have not been brought up at school, to
write and read, yet, (I thank God,) I understand English.

Now, I am not one of these fine toung`d fellows, that will forswear
themselves for a fit of knauerie: I mean truly and honestly, and so I hope,
do you, or else, I would you were hang`d for me, and all that mean otherwise,
for I do not, believe me, and you will, I will say and hold, I do not love
to make every man privy to my secrets, twere but folly: you know I love you,
and more then our selves, no man knows any thing of my mind, but your
cosenne Hobblin, by whom I sent you the last Sunday, a pair of Gloves, cut
out of the best of the Sheep skins, they cost me threepence, that they
did, and I hope, that it shall not be the last loue-token, that I will send,
and you will take, for, I have somewhat a breeding for you, and therefore,
since you know, your Father have left you the pied Heyfare, and your mother
have given you the Cosset Lamb, my Gray Mare and the Colte, that I had left me
by my Granam, and the croppe of Rye, that I have in common field, I hope (if
you mean truth and honestye) will do well to begin the world withal: how
say you? shall we clappe hands, and make a bargain?

Soft, (quoth she) stay a little, and let me go with you a little, either
trust me, or not trust me: I am either a Woman, or a Beast, and therefore never
make such a do about nothing, it was a simple napkinne, wrought with couentry
blew, wrought with hand in hand and heart between that I sent you, by your
Sister Parnell, I will not say what I paid for the working of it, besides a
pot of Beer, and two Cakes, but, let it go, I will get it up again: you said
you love me, and I love you, and I love you, and you shall find it, but, I
tell you, there is day enough to night: soft fire makes sweet malt: I pray you
be not angry: for, indeed, I am fallen out with mine Aunt, and I know your
mother is not wiling to the match: but, all is one: I am thine my boy, and I
have saine it, and I will never go from it: thou did win me at the
May Pole, when that I carried away the Garlande, and now, therefore Ienny is
thine Ienkin.

Be merry and take no thought, for, I am for thee at an hours warninge, in the
way of honesty, when thou will, and therefore, since you are so earnest on the
matter, ask the Banes, when you will, bid your friends, and I will bid mine,
and we will have a merry Bridal day, let the world wagge after as it will.

so, with a little controversy, the simple people were soon agreed: he so
besmouched her, and she so beclapped him, and there tumbling together, as
merry as they could wish, I sighed to think, what a supper they would have
after breakfast: for when the meat was spent, they might learn to fast for a
supper. Alas pore fools, but they are simply foolish, and could not do
withal: for love had caught them, and they were in for a bird: and therefore
god help the poor, for they were in a pitiful taking, but let them go:
when they were risen and parted, came in three men, a Poet, a Musition, and a
Painter: but when I saw them in their fits, oh what an humor did I fall into?
I knew not what to think. For the Poet studied so long upon a verse, that
forgetting his matter, fell flat out with his wits, and made such a rhyme, as
being not worth the reading, twere very idle for me to write it. The
Musition, he kept such a stir with looking up into the sky, for a note above
Ela, that being of a suden, so out (...) square with his humor, that he was not
wholly him self, he played such a song of the three merry men, that had the
dittie been in a strange language, I should have been puzzled in the Music:
but leaving him in his Crotchets, let me tell you a little of the Painter, who
kissed his picture, hugd it in his arms, and grew so far in love with his
own workmanship, as in the erfremitie of passion, made him cry out, oh that
thou could speak to me: but in this humor, these three having stated a
while, went their way, like servants to Lady Folly, to see what buisinesse she
had for them.

But no sooner were they gone then came in three other: a lame Soldier, a poor
Trauailer, and an vpstart Courtier: where every one having spoken his mind,
in the manner of a play they departed. The Soldier, he beat his boy for lack of
attendance, when he had played away his allowance at Primero. The Trauailer he
talked so of strange matters, that for lack of money, he was glad to fast
for his dinner. The Courtier he was so fine in his compleme^ts, that his
obligation grew scarce current for his clothes. Alas thought I, surely; only
Folly has made these men poor, and now poverty has made them fools: but,
in pity let me speak it, they were proper men, and so let them pass. Now,
no sooner were they gone, but came in three other: a seely Lawyer, a simple
Usurer, and an honest Broker. The Lawyer (as it should seem) had too much
care of conscience, for his worldly commodity; who weying the weight of every
cause, and the estate of every client, was more gracious, then polliticke: and
so like an honest poor man, better studied in the law of God, then profiting
by the law of man; more fit for prayer, then for pleading, sat reading of a
case betwixt the virtue of necessity, and the pride of superfluity: where
Lazarus out of heaven showed the blessing of patience; and Dives out of Hell
showed the reward of uncharitableness. But let him there sit shaking the head
at Usurie: and let me tell you a little of the behavior of that Monster: who
having been, (for the most part of his life,) fed with the offall flesh, the
pairings of cheese, and the droppings of tappes, wringing out the toil of the
labourer, the hard market of the tradesman, the prodigality of the rich, and
the misery of the poor. Those heaps of goulde, that had shut up his heart
in his purse, sat in the chair of iniquity, tortured with the gowte, nummed
with the palsy, cramped with the collicke, and torrmented in the soul with
the woorme of conscience: cryeing by fittes (as he had any case) oh the hell of
a wounded conscience: widows rise out of your graves, take your leases of
your houses, and pray for some ease of my passion: children of unhappy
parents, receive the gain of unlawful interest, take your portions, too long
kept from you: only pray for my comfort, that I be not utterly confounded;
miserable men, come out of your prisons, I forgive you your debts, and will
restore you your due. Oh the ertreame reward of extremity, where law is
without love, andcouetousnes without conscience; oh the tears of the widow,
the cries of the orphane, the misery of the poor, and the lamentation of the
destressed: I see them, I hear them, I feel them: Oh I know not what to do,
nor where to rest for them; they rise up to heaven, and weigh me down to hell.

Oh, what avails all the world to him, that loses his own soul: but
farewell world, I defy thee; wealth, I hate thee Avarice I detest thee,
Charity I embrace thee, Pity I love thee, Necessity I relieve thee,
Oppression I abhor thee, Mercy I adore thee, Hell I have not to do with
thee, Heaven I come to thee. So distributing to the poor, and comforting the
miserable, disposing of his worldly goods, to the good of the distressed
christian, bequeathing to the lawyer for his care of conscience, an annuitie,
to keep him from uncharitable fees: and the Broker a reasonable portion, to
make him leave his griping kind of trade or profession: rising from his seat
of torment, fell suddenly on his knees to prayer, where his pains mitigated,
and his prayers ended, he became a new creature: choosing rather to die a poor
christian, then to live a rich Jew. A strange sight, but worth the looking on:
but there let me leave him, in a good exercise, and tell yon what followed of
the Broker: that poor man feeing the lawyer, and the usurer, both gone from
the world, and himself left in a pitiful taking to tarry in it, follows
his good masters before him: delivers up his pawnes and his bonds, upon such
reasonable consideration, that within a while he grew out of cre dit with the
money-maisters, and so giving over his shop, and contented with a mean
pittance, lived like a good fool, with his good masters: but since the folly
before men, is wisdom before God, I hold such fools in better estate, then
greater knaves in more reckoning: but when these men had a while talked of the
comfort of their concertion, I scarce turned my head aside, but they were gone.
When presently came in an old fellow with a pen in his ear, and a book in
his hand: who sitting down in a seat, (like a Sumner in a Church portch, or
an A B C schoolemasster) laid down a great book before him, where he read
certain names, but his voice being somewhat law, I could not hear him, but
his words (I take it were after this manner.

William, (I know not what more) of (I know not whence) Gentleman, for selling
of his Land, and putting of it into money, and spendinge of it in the Wars,
and coming home a beggar: entertained for the shadow of wit, the fourth of
April, in the year of Imperfection, show your self in your place: wherewith
comes forth a strange creature, with a bush on his head, and a forest on
his face, a frowning brow, and a leering, Eye, who sitting down on a Beanch,
answered, Zounds, here I am, a pox of all Fools, what would thou? Well
(quoth the old man) enough, Impatience is one badge of Folly: stay a while.

Then he reads Thomas, but no more, of et cetera, that had a good stock of
money, and lost it in play, entertained for the loss of time, come forth:
when presently appeared, a poor man, ill clad, lean faced, and heavy Eied,
biting his fingers, and cursing the Rascal dice, and railing upon Fortune: Oh
God, (says the old man) Fortune is the trust of Folly, an other of my Ladies
Badges, well, sit you down.

Then begins he again: Parnell, of such a place, widdowe, well left by a
kind and careful husband, and forgetting his love, and your own good,
bestowed all, and lost all, upon a Ruffling royster; entertained for the
picture of wilfulness; where are you? When out comes a creature like a
woman, but hanging the head, and wringing the hands, and wiping the Eyes, and
with a deep sigh, saying Had I wist this would have fallen out: Oh, (well said
the old man) Had I wist, another of my Ladies favors, sit of the the other town,
Daughter to Goodmanne Braye-goose, that being brought to good huswife ry, and
for a fidlinge humor, will run from your friends, and learn a Base
occupation, show the fruit of your frauatle; when commes me forth a jolly
brown Wench, with a face a foot long, a mouth, a yard wide, a leg, like a
mill-post: and a foot, of a Giantes last, and with a belly so full, as
threatened two Twins at the least: who holding her hand on her face, said:
Idleness, Idleness, it was my utter over throw.

True, (says he) it is enough: Idleness another of my Ladies badges: Idleness
brings man tonnes, and shame follows Wickedness, the Trulles Trenchiuall:
well, take yourplace and sit down.

Which done, he reads, goodman Rableyes of hollow Grove, and Hobby Noble, of
Low Cross, having spente the profit of your yard lands, vppou trial of the
right in a hey-cocke, where be you.

When out commes twoe country people, one with hob-nailde shoes, and the other
with a patcht Ierkin, and swore, as long as they were worth a groat, they
would try the right of the law, I care not I, so I have my will, both standing
upon one point: well (quoth he) Will, it is enough; a Badge of my mistresses,
that briedes nothing but woe: makes the Lawyers rich, and your selves poor:
good Fools; sit you down.

Which done, out comes a Gallant, richly apparrelled, but meanly moneyed, who
had written on his back, In the midst of my stare. When the old man writ,
Pride will have a fall: a Lordshippe on his back, a huge weight, he must
needs sink under it.

After him follows a fine Minion, that made tweny faces, and thirty graces,
and had so many merry tricks that she made all the company laugh: when
tripping on the Toe, and counterfitting a kind of lispe, for lack of sound
teethe, she thus made use of her tongue.

Oh heavens what a world is this? Nothing but money? Why, is all handsomnes
out of fashion? is beauty at so low a price? a dainesye Wench, not worth the
whissting? is all Grass become hey? Can a dry Summer make such a dearth, that
there is no money to be had for mowers?

Now tie upon green Plununes, in troth they make my stomach wamble: good
Lord, I have so sweat, with making me ready, that if it were not for wearines,
I would not have rose before noone: But I have met with my breakefast: and
therefore I may stay my stomach to dinner: oh the French fail, and the Spanish
stitch the Italian bodies, and the Persian skarfe, I hope I will be furnished to
the proof.

And yet, to say troth, I am so fantastic, that I shall be weary of them al,
within a while: Heigh-ho: well said Sister, (says the old man) fantastic:
another badge of my Ladies; sit you down; which done, came in diverse couples
together, an old blind man, and lusty a young wench, and born before them up
in a shield: A Cornucopia: under with was written, Plenty. Next after them an
old lame woman, and a nimble young man: and before them borne, a Scorpion.

Over which, was written, Poison. Then followed a young man, and a young woman,
both poor in purse, but in good state of body: and before them borne Gemini,
and over them written, Love.

Then followed a Rich Cuckolde, and a poor Whore, and borne them Aries: and
written Patience.

Many other pretty Figures there were expressing the meaning of these Maskers,
which, for lack of a note book, are suddenly slipped out of my memory.

But, when this Mask had once gone about the Room, comes out a Fool in a
pied coat, and tells them, they must make an end quickly, and take their
places, for the Lady was coming, to see an Interlude, and presently a noise of
shames, with an outery of knaves, came out, with such a Shoute, that, (while I
look for some fine matter) wakt me suddenly out of my sleep.

So that I never heard more of any of them, but was ever man so troubled in his
sleep? well I was exceedinge glad when I was awake, I was so well and safely
delivered out of this Pur gatory.

Why, there cannot be such a thing: and therefore as a dream, let it pass: and
so, hoping that if you note well this dream, it will do you no hurt, when
you are awake, hoping you will hear with Sleepers, if any thing be not as it
should be: in some have about other business, I bid you heartily farewell.

FINIS.
