NARBONVS. The Laberynth OF LIBERTY.

Very pleasant for young Gentlemen to peruse, and passing profitable for them
to prosecute.

Wherein is contained the discommodities that ensue, by following the lust of a
man's will, in youth: and the goodness he after gayneth, being beaten with his
own rod, and pricked with the peevishness of his own conscience, in age.

against S. Sepulchers Church without Newgate. 1580.

TO THE RIGHT WORS^^^^full, Sir Thomas Parrat Knight, A. S. w^^sheth increase
of virtues in this earthly habitation, and after the fine of this lucklesse
life, everlasting happiness.
THe Egiptian Lady, ( Right Worshipful) looking earnestly in travail, on the
Picture of Andromida, was immediately delivered of a fair daughter: and Acteon
staring on those Nymphs naked and bare, was tra^sformed into the shape of a
Beast. Pigmaleon so long kissed the bre^thlesse lips of that could Stone his
picture, that he embraced it a living portrature: and that young Iphis
retayning till her marriage day the shape of a Maid, though attyred in the
habit of a man, was then made a husband, for which he long wished, and enjoyed
the company of his beloved wife. The imaginations prove often times of the
full persuasions of the mind, just to the perfect perfection of the honest
meaning: and to like the best of any thing that cannot be bettered, is the way
to be loved, and of most to be liked. You may, behoulding this purging Pill,
dislike it to be any dainty drugge: and yet reading it as you will (with
reason) persuade your self to be a delicate Dishe: for happily what pleases
you, likes not the most: and yet being loved of you, may be embraced of many.
Every man that behouldeth a protracture, cannot draw a Picture: and many eat
a Pear, that cannot make a Plum. A young youth coming into the study of
Thalias, and behoulding (at full) his Library, began to peruse one book, and
then to look in another: but not finding any for his reason, nor so mutch as
one that he could read: I had rather said he, have my books which are toys,
for that I know their meaning, then these which are true, for that I understand
not their manners. Another taking Ciceroes Pen, and beginning to write, drew
foolish sentences, and mishape^ sayings: why? said he, this is such a man's
Pen, and yet see how disorderly it has written? Answered another, but thou
have neither Ciceroes mind on thy Paper, nor his hand on thy Pen: how
therefore could thou write fair, or inue^t finely? What yields sweeter
fruit says Plato, then the wisdom of writing? and what says Anaxagoras,
yields more praise, then the profit of the Pen? but Sir, if you expect
commodities in these my cauils, you are like to be frustrate of your
cogitation: and if you look for wisdom of so wild a wit, you will prove by
his words that he is but a wanton: and no marvel, for the Fletcher makes
two shafts, before one seem sure, and the Scri^^ner may make two Pens,
before one prove for his purpose: expect not then I beseech you of this plant
but of two years grafting, so much fruit, as from the Tree of twenty years
growing: For the Apprentice must cast any bill, before he keep his Masters
book: and the Shoemaker must learn to fashion a latchet before he sow on a
Last. So, this simple Author must lie in Diogenes Tub, before his writing like
his own fantasye, and put on Socrates Gown, before his doings please all
favors. There was brought unto Appelles the head of a Noble man, being slain,
to have his counterfayte drawn, and the favor that his face then retained to
be devised: which he promised to do effectually, and to end it speedely: then
wiping his face, being a little bloody, perceived him to be a goodly personage,
when before he lived, though now (dead) he looked not so lovely: then
behoulding it better, saw in his cheek a little cut with some blow, whereout
so fast as he wiped issued a drop of blood: then he drew the favor of his
face, and the drop of blood on his cheek: said the other, wherefore have thou
made his face so white, and his lips so wan, and yet that drop of blood so on
his cheek? For (said he) were that spot away, they would think he lost all
his blood when he left his life, but now they may see, he inioyeth that dead,
which he possessed living: If then Appelles had controulers, being so perfect
a Painter, I surely shall find cauillers for this imperfect posie: the
simplicity of this work I know will cause it be liked but of few, yet some no
doubt will reed it though but for a fashion: for though Narbonus were in his
youth allured to many wanton lusts, yet once having felt the force of Fortune,
was seduced to an honest life. But as the Crow thinks they are not her own
birds, unless they look as black as her self, and the Eagle imagines they
are not her own brood unless they look against the Sun: so this youth would
not be reformed until he saw his own follyes before his face, nor be
reclaimed till he had tasted some purging Pills for his mad maladyes. But some
(happily) will imagine me to have been in love, for putting here this name
Lust, but rather they may think me to have lived by the loss, that have been
lured so mutch to my own liberty: yet I am like him in this respect that
puts up a Supplication to his Prince, who regards not who dislike him so
it please his person: So, first will I way your proof, and then regard others
propertye: He must I know arise earlye that shall like all men, and he must
write well that shall please all minds: but he that planteth trees in a
Forest, knows not how many shall taste the Fruit, and he that sows in his
garden diverse Seeds, knows not who shall eat of his Sallets. He that
planteth a Vine, knows not who shall taste his Wine: and he that puts any
thing in Print, must think that all will peruse it: If then amongst many
blossoms, some prove blastes, no marvel if amongst many Readers, some prove
Riders: but let them laugh, to see if I will lowre: for who so accepts not my
good will shows himself to have but small wit: But as (all ready) my
assurance is sufficient of your goodness: so therefore am I bold to boast of
your gratiousnes, for the which I present you this rude work: Which, I beseech
you to accept, though it come from a rusticall writer, so may you in time gain
a more stately style, of so imperfect a studient: and so shall you bind me to
blaze your name to the farthest I may, with safetye, and to honor you in heart,
who seems to accept gratefully this my presumptuous proffer. Which seeing it
has so pleased you, I shall not think any one thing to great for your gain,
nor any so worthy, my duty reserved. I obediently bow to the knees of your
courtesy, and yield my self always at your command: wishing you the
greatest happiness your heart desires, and that beatitude post funera: which
your soul delights.

Your Worships duetifully to obey, and most willingly to be commanded. A. S.

To the Gentlemen Readers.
I Stood maruailing Gentlemen, after the vvriting of this troublesome trashe,
and the finishing of this tedious travail, and fared like Alexanders man, who
shiuered in the Sun and svvet in the shadovv: or like the Thessalian Lady
that wept, when she beheld her protrated Picture, and was sorrovvfull when
she vvrote any letter, fering it should be disliked: I doubted, whether best
present this to the Printer to be put in the Press, or give it the Painter to
pin on a Post, but remembering that the Painter, if a man be bald, he paints
him bare: then thought I, this being nothing nice, he will dravv it stark
naked: yet let the Printer have any book, and it shall be bought though but a
babble, and let the Painter have any Picture, and it shall be stared on, though
but a Beast. Seeing therefore Vulcan to be drawn with his foul foot, so well
as Venus to be painted with her fair face, I thought my book might as well
lie in a shop, as other ballads which stand at sale: yet he that puts any thing
in Print to the end to have it praised, is like him that coms into a Church to
have his bravery noted: But Tullie (I remember) the most eloquent, pleased not
al with his svveete sayings: and Crassus so broad mouthed as any, was liked
of some, with his sour sothings. The solacing strings of Orpheus could not
save his life with his sweet Music, yet the Pipe of Pan, was liked with his
rusticall melody: he was regarded in the country, and I happily shall be read
in the Court: he was a stale to many, and I look to be a laughing stock to
more: If the best vvriters have not been liked of some wantons, should my self
think mutch to be loathed of many that are vvilfull. I look not that Fortune
which was never favorable in words of small weight, should now be freendly
in works of great wisdom: And as my ill hap has hitherto been so hard as
anies, so look I not to have it amended by this hereafter. The old saying is:
he that lives in hell, thinks there is no other heaven* and he that daunceth
with the Devil, cares not, so he be loved of his Damme. Augustus said, he
had rather be a Pigge in Herodes country, then a child in his Court: for all
the male children he put to the sword, but Svvines flesh amongst the Jews,
was loathesome and unsavory, and he that shall write to please the faculties
of all fancies, must either reach beyond the Moon, or miss of his mark: And
if any thing be worthy blame, reprove Narbonus who knovves you not, and if
Saker, any way have merited shame, let him be repayed with such sauce, though
he hate you not: Yet had not I liked to love you, this should never have come
forth of my Liberty: and had I not been willing to saluted you courteously,
I should expected to been revvarded as carelessly: and the most that I ask,
is but Bona verba, for my willing mind, and good will for my honest meaning:
if you repay me with less, I must live by the loss, but if you grant me so
much, it is the uttermost I look for: And Gentlemen, if you pardon me, for
this same being the first, I will excuse my self when I present you the
second? which if you deny me, I vovv it shall be the last: And if you gain
say me this reasonable request, I will never offend your ears with so
unseasonable a suit: As for the verdite of fools, I plead not for their
pardons, and for the sottish sort, I mean not to prove them with
protestations: I know some will grinne, but not take hold of my flesh: and
other will snap, but not touch my finger: Gentlemen I know will be ruled
with reason: as for others, I fear not their rigor: for who so likes of my
doings, I shall be bound to commend their demeanours, but who pretends me
faithless favor, I must of force requite with flattring freendshippe.

Farewell.
NARBONVS.
THere dwelt near the City of Vienna, a Gentleman, named Narbonus: of
personage beautiful, and in behavior bountiful: in substance, not superior to
any: yet (...) wit, inferior to many: in goodness, grateful: and to his power,
beneficial: He had left him, by the death of his father, some small
possessions, and a little land^ to maintain his calling: wherewith, had he been
so wisely disposed, as he was wantonly delighted, he might have bragged with
the best, and accompanied the greatest: and had his wit been so well employed,
as his will was euely occupied, he had needed no counsailer for his commodity,
nor any schoolemaister for his humanity: But as he was young, so was he
wild: and as he was wealthy, so was he disposed pleasantly: as he was
ritche, so was he ryotous: and yet as he was wanton, so was he courteous. But
wit is never good before it be bought, and youth never brydled before he have
bidden the brunt: and as the tender twigge will easily be bowed, where the old
tree will not by any ^eanes be bente: as the young Coult will be reclaymed with
a snaffle, when the old Jade will never be manaced with any bridle: as the
young Fawn will be made take bread at a man's hand, when the old Bucke will not
by any means look upon a man: so as yet this Impe was to be grafted to bear
the first fruit, and now began the spring when it should yield the brauest
blossom: now was the sap come into the heart, and now such seed as was sown,
such fruit should be found: such as was the plant, such would prove the pear:
how the ground was tilled, such fruit would come from it: and as the fertillest
fields not well husbanded, will yield the thickest thistles, so contrary,
wrought as it should be, gives greatest increase of corn: the more perfect
memory in any man, the apter to delight in vile vice, which once reclaimed to
honesty, the one blotted out, great goodness quickly insueth: who then Paul a
greater persecutor? who then he a more godly professor? Samuel first called
by God, after chosen his Chaplain: Caesar first a slavish Soldier, after, a
great and valiant Conqueror: as the years do increase, so should a man's
goodness grow, and as strength enters into a man's arms, so should wisdom
enter into the brains: Why does a man grow in greatness, but that also he
should wax in goodness? this youth was acquainted with many vices the which he
accustomed, and nozled in some virtues which he not greatly frequented, some of
his blossoms were blasted, and some seeds prospered perfectly: some of his
virtues were bitten with ^rost, which made no show til they came to the
ripeness: but then flourished fresh and green^: other of his plants prospered
well, and made a goodly show on so perfect a tree as nature her self saw the
growth thereof: The River Nilus ingendreth the foul Crocadile, and castes up
the precious perles: the filthy Toade has a fair stone in her head: the
Serpents skin is very medicinable for sundry things, where contrary, the Be
has Honey in her mouth and a sting in her tail: the swetest rose has some
prick, the clearest Well, some dyrte in the bottom: so the most deformed man
may have some good condition, the vylest nature some good imaginacion: the
greatest pretended mischief, some spot of mercy: the stinging Netle is salve
for some sore: the poisoned Hemlocke retayneth some virtue, and the Poppy seed
is excellent good for many things: but the purest perfection may have some
spot of suspicion, the clearest complexion some fault of favor, the best wit
stained with some devilish device: Narbonus was neither void of humility, nor
ouerladen with amity: not troubled with more honestly then he needed to occupy:
nor charged with more goodness then his body could carry, nor filled with more
feruencie then his stomach could digest: yet his conditions not to be blamed,
nor his inconstancy any ways reproved: being in the Country he wanted no
companions to court him, and spending^ his time so lewdly, lacked no Lovers to
entice him to folly: and though the rusticall Country be not so stuffed out
with swa^hers, as the City is fortified with swearers, yet their fruit is
often eaten with Caterpillars, and more full fraughted then needs with
flatterers: not so full of good nurture, as infected with vile nature: better
fed then taught, and better manned then mannered: This courteous crew that
followed his humor, enticed him sumtimes to follow the hounds, then to fly
with the Hawke: now to rowse the bristlinge Boar from out his drowsy den, and
then to have the bouncing Bucke in chase: sometimes to use the Tilte yardes,
and then again to exercise their weapons, here was neither practiced Geomitry,
nor studied Philosophy: neither Music used, nor Divinity loved: nothing
seen in Arithmeticke, and as little knowledge in Astrology: neither the Law
lyked, nor so much as a book looked on: but all began to go to wrack, and
every good motion no sooner thought on, but as speedily forgotten. He had
dwellinge in Vienna an Uncle of great estimacion, and his credit no less
the^ he deserved, for he was beloved of his Neighbors, and favored of his
friends, commended of his acquaintance, and honored of those that knew him,
lyked of the most, and hated but of few: for wisdom, he was furnished to
serve his turn, and his wit any way merited no blame: for his substance
sufficient to satisfy his estate, and his goods so many as suffised his
calling: for his courtesy he wanted no instructor, and for good
entertainment: to few inferior: and for that he was without any Son, and
unlikely ever to have a Daughter: never a child by nature, nor any kinsman to
his knowledge except his Nephew: He therefore behouldinge the life that he
led, and the folly he followed, the little government he had of his living, and
as small regard to employ it the best way: not regarding any study, and
caringe not whither ever he tumbled over his Books, or never looked on them
again: but apt to follow any wilfulness, and not regardinge to apply any
goodness: waying more the pleasure of his companions, then the furtheraunce of
his own felicity: and an yuche of pastime, was worth an ell of profit. His
Uncle therefore on a time sent for him to Vienna, the messenger certefiyng him
of great business, who willingly condiscended to awayte on his good Uncle,
glad to be at the command of his favorable freendshippe: and in deed
repaired according to promise, unwilling to displease him whom above all
others he favored: but well contented to hear the cause of his sending for.
Where no sooner come, but entertained as courteously as him felfe desired:
where after a few matters of course, and common things of custom: the good
man his Uncle uttered the occasion of his sendinge for, and wherefore he was
cyted to arrive at his house, by these words followinge.

Nephew Narbonus, the longest Summers day has but his limited time of common
course and then the Sun draws toward the western Mountains, clean from
our sight, and we enjoy the uncomfortable night again: the weary winters
night lasts but the appointed time, and we behold the joyful dawning as
before: the pleasant spring sweetly begins, and flies again like a
shadow: the wallowinge Waves having attained their highest, retire to their
former place as before: the grene Grass once grown to the full perfection,
withers to nothing but earth, as at the first: The greatest Monarche that
ever lived, ran but his race, and so his name grew again to nothing,
having the time of his death appointed as well as other men: The happiest
felicity has some fall, and the greatest goodness some dram not very dainty:
the fruitfullest trees are not free from some Caterpillars, and the most
fortunate Weal wrought with some woe: and how long does this tickle state
endure, or this fluttinge fortune remain, when Empires are subverted, and
Kingdoms overthrown: when Dukedomes go to wrack, and Princes pine in
poverty: when the ritchest fall to decay, and the prowdest stoop to the yoke
of fortune: who will rejoice in his welfare, and trust the uncertainty of his
time? who therefore can think he sayleth safely, that is always in danger of
the rocks? who can imagine he trauaileth surely, that is always amongst
thieves? who is safe in warfare, whither he fly or follow, the greatest
certainty is not sure, and the best uncertainty unsteadfast? Who so proud as
Lucifer, who sooner thrown down into Hell? who so high minded as
Nabuchodonozer, but who so changed from so mighty a Prince to a brute Beast?
who so wicked as Ahab, who more severely punished: the strongest cannot boste
of his happiness, nor the mightiest crake of the length of his life: the
prowdest cannot brag of his tyranny, nor the rychest rejoice that he lived
ever the longer: the greatest that ever lived has felt the force of fortune,
and the highest has been made to stoop: though Cacus were a Giant, yet was
Hercules stronger: and though Goliath were high, yet was he made shorter by the
head: and if Samson were the stowtest that ever lived, yet met he with his
match: if not by strength, yet by policy: if not by might, yet by slight: if
not by greatness of body, yet by the sleightes of subtle devices. Ulysses was
valiant, yet won to be a servile subject: Achilles was gallaunt, yet met he
with his peers: though Lemnon were feared, yet was he vanquished. Alas, the
most fortunate is but fickle, and the gretest subject to slavery: thraldom
has happened to the noblest, and bondage to the brauest: the yoke has been
laid on the necks of Princes, and Emperors, led in cheines of Iron: the
greatest goodness that a man gains in this lustly life, is the same that
follows by learning, and the only honor we should hunt after: then the which
what is there greater? then the which, what is there more pro^^table^ then the
which, what is there more estimable? then the which, what is there more
commendable in all ages? then the which, what one thing is there that lasts
after life? And how is virtue attained? or by what means is wisdom found
out? from whence comes the knowledge of all prowess? and how do Kings
learn to bear swaye? is it not the ground of all goodness, and the only hope
of all happiness? Vi^it post funera virtus: and what can a man name ye lasts
after death, or what memorial is there made of any thing whatsoever, after
our departure? do riches endure after death, because they abound in life? no
trust me: every good thing takes the original from thence, and as it has a
beginning, so shall it never have end: who commends not the Books of
Cicero, before the wealth of Cressus? and the wisdom of Solomon, before ye
strength of Sampson? the sweet words of Tullic, before the threatenings of
Minos: and the sober sayings of Anaxagoras, before the flattering tales of
Aristippus: the prudence of Cato, before the foolishnes of Midas: and the
School of Thalias, before the Court of Venus: And for that I know the Country
to be more given to pleasure, then profited by wisdom: better disposed to use
pastime, then to frequent Uertues Schools: more delighted with the love of
liberty, then practiced in the law of ciuility: more pampered in their own
foolishnes, then well nurtured in behavior, or gratefulnes: you are not
ignorant of the great good will, that always was beetweene your Father and
me, not only brotherly love, but also such mutual freendship, as my purse
lay always open at his command: and he to requite me as freendly used like
courtesy in what soever. I lamente your Fathers departure, the more your
loss, ye greater my grief: for kinsmen you have few, but such as for money
will claim you of their kindred: for acquaintance, you have more then is
needful, unless greater for your gain, and more profitable: I only am
left the standerde, and you the second, both which make but half a mess, a
^^mple service for so aunciente a family: as for children, you know none I
have, nor any am likely to get: my possessions are not small, and my lands not
the least, my living more then I spend the revenues, and my credit^ more then
I would it were: but as my charges is great, so my care cannot be little: and as
my substance is much, so the means to leave it is yet to make, and for the
bestowing thereof, the choice is yet in mine own hands: and if duty bind me
to perticipate my lyuinge to you, the only heir of me, for want of a child
to enjoy my lands, yet nature binds me more straightly to beestowe it on
you beeinge the last, or at the least nearest allied to me in line or lignage:
and for that it is common for every man to give to his cosen, when he has
neither children nor brothers, I will not be found to digress the bounds of
nature, or break ancient custom: but if you merit well you shall have
enough, if sufficient serve the turn: know you therefore, that the cause of
your coming, and the business I sent for you, is to let you understand somewhat
for your profit, and a little for your commodity: the loytering life which you
lead in the Country, and the careless consuming of your time, is the way to
weary you, and the means to make you no miser, yet miserabler: of small
credit, and as little calling: better acquainted, then beloved: and better
known the^ trusted: In deed, I confess the Country to be passing pleasant,
and excellent painful: more dangerous then dainty: more maydenly then
mannerly: and more troublesome then trusty: for delights they are not dainty,
and all exercises greatly used: all which are baits to allure a stronger the^
your self, and to win one more wise to delight their wiles^ Of three things
therefore I give you your choice, leave which you list, and choose that which
likes you, whither to be a Merchant, and use those trades which I can
acquaint you withal, or a Studient to follow the Schools, and use the
Uniuersities, or a Trauailer, to see for rain Countreies, and learn strange
languages: and in that your living is but small, it shall be augmented: and the
better to maintain your state, your allowance shall be amended: if you think
good to be here with me, I shall be as well satisfied, as you sufficiently
contented: which if you do, my counsel shall not be hurtful to persuade you,
nor my dooinges a cause of your hinderaunce, but the only means for your
preferment: Here you may turn your Gould to the greatest gain, and your
Silver to the surest safety: use mine, so it be to your profit: and your own
as benificiall as you may: you may walk the City, and tread the streates:
make your Mart with Marchantes, and use conference with Trauailers, debate
with Counselors, and associate the Citizens: accompany Artifficers, and use
the fellowshippe of some faithful friends: and so make your choice, as you
rue not your loss, nor repent your bargain: for all sorts of friends are
here to be sound, both good and bad: both honest and disloyal, both trusty and
faithles: as well the Spider as the Be, as well the Toade as the Turtle, as
well the Woolfe as the Lamb, as well the Fox as the Dooue: As well Jason ye
falsest, as Iesippus the faythfullest: as well Aneas most untrue, as Camillus
most constaunt: as well Cressid forsworn, as Troylus most just of his word.
The feelds yt are full of flowers: are full of weeds and Nettels: and this
City so populous, not without flatterers or dissemblers: the ground yields
as well corn for commodity, as Thistles that are hurtful: the fresh Rivers
breed as well the fleetinge fish, as the sprawling Frog: if you here escape the
Cirtes, you may fall into Caribdis: if you fly the wrath of Jupiter, you may
find the frowning of Saturn: if you escape the Semplagades, yet you shall
come amidst the gaping Cicloppes. You shall hear these Swashbucklers swear,
and these ruffians royst it in their rudeness, who will not stick to crack
out oaths good cheap, and to coin lies for nothing: great acquaintance you
shall find, but few friends to credit: painted sheathes, but rusty swoordes:
fair faces with crooked conditions: those that will laugh in a man's face and
cut his throat: If happily thou find any whom thou like to make thy friend,
and his fancy please thy favor, try him before thou trust him, and prove him
before thou praise him, and use him before thou (...) him: if thou find him
faithful, use him familiarly: if faithles, reward him as slenderly: if
doubtful, be thou dangerous: if subtle, be thou ielous: carry a Ringe in the
one hand, and a Fig in the other: write him but in thy tabling book, so may
thou easily blot him out again: use him as the Irishman does his wife: who
marries her for a month, then if he like her not sends her packing: be
wary therefore how thou dealest, and careful with whom thou do bargain: whom
thou likest, and how thou set him at sale: how his conversation is, and what
his friends are: whither his calling be so good as thine, or unfit thy person:
the subtilnes of some will cause thee dislike of many, and the collusions of
dissemblers, will make thee careful whom thou choosest thy familiars: the
highest flying Hawke, proves often haggardly, and the best conditions ly not
always under brave apparel: the sweetest words may come from faithless
lips, and loving looks often deceive fond fools: the highest hills not
surest to build upon, nor the fairest river surest to swim in: the greenest
grass hides the greatest Snake, and in the richest ground lies the filthy
Toade: and is not the precious pearl found in the molded earth? the Silver
tried out of the sand? the sweet Rose grows on a stinkinge dunghill: where
lodges more honesty, then in a simple couche of straw? where rests more
freendship then in poor apparel, where more virtue then under a ragged
coat? way not the estate of the man, but the man by his conditions: regard
not his goodly personage, but his good behavior: esteem not his great
revenues, but his goodness, being as grateful to his power, as thou art
benificiall to thy calling: thou know the painted pottes have deadly poison
within them, and costly clothes, ragged walls underneath them: and where will
the filthy Spider sooner spin her poisoned web, then in the brauest houses:
and to use the company of thy superiors, thou shall be accounted saucy,
although thou be shamefaste: proud in mind, be thou never so simple in
spirit: haughty in heart, be thou never so duetifull in thy dooinges: the
surest safegards is the merry mean, and the safest sailing in the smoothest
Rivers: If they thy betters, what shall thou do but please them, though thou
displeasure thy self? what shall thou say but sooth them, though a very lie?
what shall thou speak but to flatter them, though contrary thy conscience? if
thou excel them in apparel, they will say thou art proud, in not contenting
thy self with thine own estate: if better monyed, they will immagine thou
come not by it so well as thou might do: if thy courtesy be better
lyked of others, then their curiosity loved of any, they will seek thee some
displeasure, or procure thee some mischief: Where contrariwise, in vsinge the
company of thy inferiors, thy credit will be cracked, and thy good name set
soon to sale: they will imagine their courtesy, worthy to be preferred before
thy wealth, and their virtues to be embraced, before thy riches are to be
esteemed: their honesty before thy behavior, and their goodness before thy
gratefulness: and they will not stick to report, were not my honesty more
regarded, then my riches are to be wayed, I could not have gained him my
freende, who favors me so well: and in so dooinge, does he more then I
deserve? no trust me, nor so much as I mente, for were I not worthy, I should
not be chosen, and were not my conditions godly, my calling could not be so
liked: thus the best breeds thy sorrow, and the worst increases thy grief:
the best forsooth is to good, and the worst to be preferred for virtues that
know not what honesty means, nor never had to do with it: therefore Narbonus,
prefer thy lykinge before my choice, thy love before my desire, thy own fancy,
before my free will: The Mean is the plainest noate, and the surest singinge,
the Base is to low for thy liking, and the Treble to high for thy reachinge:
use therefore thy choice, and take thy own consent, make thy own match, for
thou art like to abide the bargain: l^ke what thou bakest, such must thou
eat, and such as thou take, that must thou stand to: that which likes the,
cannot displease me, so it be honest, and thy living shall procure my love, if
it be virtuous: but sow in any wise the seed of constancy, so shall thou reap
the fruit of thy felicity, and use thy faithful friend with loyalty to the
last of thy life: so shall thou purchase me thy most assured, so long as thou
list: but thy duty always reserved toward me, so shall my goodness never
leave thee, til I forsake my life: and in forgoing my life, thy happiness will
not be procured, though my livings be obtained. Certefie me therefore, good
Narbonus, the full effect of thy purpose, and let me understand the drift of thy
device, which is best thy liking, and what fittest thy doing, I expect thy
answer.

Narbonus stood all this while, sometimes so wrapped with joy, and then again so
moved with obedience: now glad of his good hap, and then maruailing at the
goodness of his Uncle: now laughing in mind, and th^^ weping in heart, to see
the carefulnes he had of him, and the unkindness of himself: but at length
arming him self with boldness, and reiectinge all manner of fearfulnes, he
replied as follows.

Dear Uncle, as I am to thank you for your gracious counsel, so am I
dutifully bound, to obey your excellent devises: and as I am to be blamed for
spending my time so loyteringly, so shall I for ever be at your command, for
procuring my felicity: and what your good pleasure shall think beneficial
for my estate, my willing obedience shall not make any spotte of
preiudicialitie, maugre your meaning: your hoarie hears do hasten my part to
conceive passing well of your determinations, and my mind being mollifyed with
the rules of reason, will easily taste your wholesome lessons, duty binds
me to do no less, and age constreyneth me to my might, yet ability wants
to my willing mind: which seeing it has pleased your goodness so gratefully
to offer, I will not be reproved of wilfulness, vngratiously to persist your
purpose: touching my estate as yet unstayed, and my loytering life that has
unprofitably bin led, has hitherto not bin troublesome to many, nor chargeable
to any, disliked of some, and loved of others, blamed as I deserved, but not
utterly conte^^ted, or altogether reproved: the good demeanor you say of my
Father, has possessed me a place in your heart, and if therefore my soul be
found unmindful of your benefits, I wish to be rejected, where now I am
beloved, your civility (dear Uncle) bewrayes you not only a Citizen in
outward show, but inwardly an helper to your poor friends, and a furtherer
of your near neighbors: but Sir, you condemn the Country causeless, and
imagine their craftiness to be cloaked with simplicity: but talk with a
Clown, and he will better resolve you then my self can certifye you: but this
I know by experience, and that my eyes have seen, my lips may boldly utter,
your streets are stately, our pathwayes are pleasant: your houses haughty,
our habitations handsome: your Shoppes abound in bravery, our Barnes are
filled with fruitful commodity: your Gardens are fine out of measure, our
Fields are fair with all pleasure: your Dames decked in bravery, our wines
wedded in honesty: you want nothing, and we lack not all things: you
confess, our exercises are first preferred, our healthes the likelier to be
preserved: you eat like Epicures, we absteyne like Stoykes: you are cloyed
with the excess of Heliogabalus, we contented with the roste of Romulus: you
the quassinge of Alexander, we never surfeit with drinking fair water: you the
flattery of Aristippus, we the faith of Laelius: you devout Uotaryes, we of
God true feruitours, you the music of Apollo, we the Pipe of Pan^ we Hawk
without hurt, you hunte like Homer: we ride for recreation, you rest for
rewards: we often meet merrily, you oftener manerly: our banqueting brings
restoritie, your feasts are filled with gluttony: you wanton, we warli^e:
we try our strength, you dry your drugges: you fence it, we fight it: though
you want not any thing, yet have we that suffices our turns, you give me
gracious instructions, and godly lessons, in warning me of your wiles, and
telling me of your toys: for (alas) the silly Bird is quickly caughte with
the lime-twigge, the subtle Fox is taken in his own hole, the greedy Wolf
sometimes killed even in the Sheepefold, and no marvel if my simplicity gain
me quickly a place of infidelity: in that there are both the Sirtes, and the
Semphlagades, both Lays and Calipso, both Iesabell, and Jason, alas, how shall
I look? how shall I walk? whom shall I way? whom shall I believe? whom shall
I try? whom shall I trust? whom shall I credit? who will not deceive me?
how dare I? nay, why dare I not? for that dastards are oftnest in greatest
danger: here are the sweet Sirenes, here the meek Mermaydes, here the
faythlesse flock of Flora, but where the vestals of Diana? here is lust
without love, liberty without loyalty, affection without faith, constancy
without chastity, behavior without honor, fancy without feruencie, small
vestalitie, yet less modesty: if happily I choose some faithful friend, I
shall be fearful he will prove a faithless foe: if I prove Damon* he
Damocles: he Theseus, I Ulysses: I Orestes, he Protheus which turns into
every shape: I then shall be sorrowful beyond measure, and my care will be
greatly increased: thus shall I graft grapes, and reap rushes: first must I
prove, then praise: first view, then vaunt: first get, then gain: first
try, then trust: first have, then hold: once gained, never forsaken, and once
gotten never lost: if his birth better than mine, then will he blame me: if his
living greater, then disdeyne me: if he many friends, I beholding to him, if
I few, he not regarding me: if hardharted, then will he hate me: if furious
hasty, faythlesse defye me: but to know, and then to keep, is a peerless
patrimony, and a doubt void of all danger: and what? shall I prove, and not
be proved? nay: shall I not be reproved? trial on any man, is sufficient to
acquit any villainy. Constantius, father to Constantine the Great, to the end
to make trial of his faithful friends, and to repress his faithless foes,
favoring greatly the faith of the Gospel, and loathing those that liked it
not, on a time determined to make known the good will he bare to his loving
subjects, and to repress the rage of rebellious Roysters, putting in proof a
practice, as profitable to his own estate, as commendable in so noble a man as
himself, caused to be bruted abroad and proclaimed openly, that those old
ordinances of the Gentiles, and Statutes of the Paganes, touching Religion,
should in as ample manner be used, with such superstitious Ceremonies of the
Canonical Clergy, and devilish devises of old dotardes, as had before bin
used, and ever till his time maynteyned, which to be performed with speedy
perfection, the forfeyture of fire and faggot was to be rendered to the
resistantes: to the speedy dispatche whereof, the Nobility were first willed
to veil their bonets, and lead the dance, then the Laytie to follow within
the compass of the time allotted. Shortly after, the Emperor held a
general Counsel, and made a solemn meeting, as well the Spirituality, as
also the Temporaltie, where this matter was called in question, and sifted to
the uttermost, all were asked, all examined, all proved, but not all found
peerless: all tried, but not all found trusty: a great number of lusty
gallants quickly consented, yielding to all such articles as were set down,
and agreeing to whatsoever had bin proclaimed, no torture, no tormente, no
fire, no faggot, should cause them recant their sayings, or alter their
determinations. Then were examined the Laytie, and those of the meaner sort,
the greatest number of the which had cast their ancker long sithence, which
should never be removed out of the sands of their souls, without the loss of
life, and the fruition of the last felicity. The good Emperor waying well the
poverty of their penury, the truth of their trial, and the clearenesse of
their consciences, that loss of living, and forgoing this liberty, and rather
the fear of death could not remove their minds, or change their hearts:
whereat these gallantes that had lately turned their tippets, and moved their
minds from better to worsse, laughed in their sleeves, and had the others
greatly in derision, he caused immediately all those turnecotes to be banished
the Court, and their livings to be given unto the others, and if ever they
returned, death was their due, and they should surely have it, made those
Counselors to his highness, and the others rejected for ever out of his
presence: for (said he) these men are fit for so noble a personage as my
self, and worthy my Counselors: such friends I fear me shall I find, who
will groape me for gain, and turn away for every trifle: march in the main
battle, but fly from the fight, look for the spoil, but bide no brunt of
the broyle: lost with an egg, and won with an apple: I as hot as Aetna,
they as cold as Caucasus: I as true as Troylus, they as false as Jason: if I
fry in faith, they will freese in falsehoode: if the company of some virgin do
entice me to like her, and perhaps allure me to love her, I shall hardlye
find a Castor: easily a Flora, sooner a haggardish Helen, than a chaste
Lucretia: sooner a beastly Biblis, than a godly Theocrita: great courtesy,
but little chastity: solemn protestations, but slender perfourma^ces: sweet
words, but bitter in the eating: to flatter is a high poynct, and to gloss a
glorious gain: the one yields perdition, the other brings destruction: to
paynt the^ out in their pride and to carue them in their colors, I should but
incur their displeasures, and do my self small profit: the best is but
badde, yet my self can not make the worst better: yet beauty, the more it is
discommended, the greater desire a man has to behold it: and a good thing
mixed with that which is more vile, makes a better show. Venus seemed most
fair of favor, when the black bearde of Vulcane was always with her: is
not the Rose neatest that grows amongst nettles: the color of white most
perfect, painted upon a black ground. But as all is not Gold that glistreth,
nor all Silver that shines, so cache painted portrature proves not the
purest, nor every sauce that is sauourest the most wholesomest: the sower
broth does as well comfort the stomach; as the sweet sugre seems pleasant
in the taste: the choice of friends are so changeable, and the estate so
unstayed of such young nouices as my self, that thynking to gain the greatest
treasure, I may find but rusty iron, and deluing for the good gold, may get
but colored copper: whom should I choose my companions, when the highest are
out of my reach, and the lowest stand upon the terms of their virtues: to
atteyne the touching of the Skies with my finger I should be counted very
foolish, and so base as to go into Hell, the mind of a miserable man: then
the earth is the only place of my estate, and the seat to prove the penalty
of my fortune: the highest things have the greatest fall, but he that goes on
the ground, can fall but to the earth, and falling no farther, may easily rise
again. Where you will me to use your house as my own home, your habitation,
as my proper mansion, and your goods, as my own gold: the greatest thing* to
requite your courtesy, and the most that I can give you is thanks for your
goodness, and obedience for your desarte: the one I give you so franckly as I
am able to offer, as for the other where my doings shall be found contrary
to your deserts, I pray to be rewarded with shame, and to be dealte withal
according to my doubleness: pleases it you therefore to be some stay unto me,
and a helper, to maynteyne my poor portion, the best I think fit my
calling, and the likeliest I see to be any preferment to my estate, is to apply
the study of the law, and to practice it so speedely as may be. Wittenberge
has the name for good Sudentes, and the better Scholars, the likelyer I,
soonest to atteine the perfection of my study, and the effect of my purpose:
pleases you therefore to furnish me with necessaries, and to provide for my
wantes, my long absence shall not procure my penalty, nor the driving off the
time a hynderance to my studies.

The good old man Henricus his Uncle was as glad to hear his wise answers, as
he was afterward sorry for his lewd behavior, and as well contented to
furnish him with all necessaries, as afterward moved to behold his careless
life, he therefore furnished him with all necessaries whatsoever, and provided
so well for his journey, as himself desired. After a few courteous
gratulations, and sweet embracings, with sugared words, as the common course
of custom is, Narbonus committed his Uncle to the governance of God, and
himself to the favor of the fair fields, and pleasant paths: now is our
young youth in the worn way to Wittenberge, and feeling the hard trotting of
his Horse, our Lady be his speed, and send him as delectable a passage, as he
is a morously minded. When sundry cogitations assailed him, and many vain
fancies flew before his face, which were not so quiclie come, but as
suddenly faded again, flattering himself with this conceyte, and then
drowned in desire with some other, quite contrary: but amongst other thoughts
that assailed him, and devises that troubles him, he uttered these words to
himself: Alas Narbonus, how will God now deal with thee? for other friends
here thou shall hardly find, first deprived of my good mother, the special
friend of my prosperity, and the only worker of my weal, whose secure care in
wishing me well, was as much as nature could give: for the love of the mother
is always greater, than the good will of any other friend, and great reason
why it should be so, for that her travel is the greatest in bringing it to the
world: her care is also the most, in preserving and nourishing it to the best
motion of her mind, and bringing it up most obedientlye in the fear of God,
and dutifully toward all others whatsoever: and had I but retained her, my
grief should have bin the less, and my sorrows not so many, but the
destinies had so appointed it, why then should my consent be wanting, and my
willing mind absente in any respect? then lost I my Father, by whom I enjoy
these small possessions, and little revenues, to maynteyne my poor estate,
God send me no more such fyndings, nor give me such windfalles: his care of
my prosperity was not small, though my disobedience toward him were great,
his great desire that he had of my mayntenance, and the little duty I showed
therefore^ his secure care in bringing me up in learning and good civility,
and as little regard on my part to fulfill his commandments: and the last
words that he spoke to me, when afterward I never saw him open his mouth
more, were, that I should be busy with my Books, and plye them as my most
perfect patrimony: for thy Books (said he) will yield thee heavenly
knowledge, as for all other things, they are but ^a^thly, and therefore full
of vanity: which words come now into my remembrance, and happened by chance
into my head, appointed I think of God, as a mean to help me forward, and a
motion to make my desire the greater: therefore my good will shall not be
found any way negligen^e, nor my mind to be moved with any other delight.
And now have I lost the residue of my friends, and departed the ^ighte of all
my old companyons, whose sights whylest I enjoyed, was comfortable, and their
fellowship favorable: perhaps they will enquire of me, and hearing of my
departure, seem sorrowful, or el^e wisshe me well: but what gain I by that?
or happily desire my safe return: but in the mean time their sight is
absente, and out of sight, will in time he also out of mind: seldom seen,
is soon forgotten, and once gone, and never remembered, which I know not to
be more sooth, than sure, more common, than true: more often spoken, than
always performed: somewhat I know by my own nature, and my imagination can
not be but true: the death of my Father was so grievous at the first, and my
lamenting so intolerable, as if my Soul should have forsaken my Body, or my
life left the habitation where it dwelte: but time makes me almost not
remember his favor, and this long time since has caused me forgette
(almost) an^ethyng that ever he did: shall not my company he then forgotten,
and my remembrance put clean out? shall my doyngs be talked on, or my sayings
remembered? shall any drink to the health of me, or remember me at their
feasts: no, as my departure was suddayne, so will my name be as soon
forgotten: and look as the wallowing waves tumbling over any thing fallen into
the Sea, or suncke down to the botthome by chance, for certain Tides after it
may be seen, or looked upon as it lies, but when the Fluddes have washed
the Sands over it, or made it to be hidden, the very likeness is quicklye
forgotten, and afterward, the very thing it self. Or as the picture of a man
hanging by the walls, decays in couloure, and fades in favor, till all
be consumed, and nothing remains but the bare Table, he is never drawn
again, because the form is forgotten, and the favor not remembered. Or as
the Toome of a dead man long buried, at last fallinge to decay, and being
broken down, is in time trodden even with the Earth, and never after builded,
because both the superscription is forgotten, and the memorial of the manne
lost* even such is my case, and so shall be my estate, thus shall I be
trodden on in mind, and my remembrance blotted quite out. Thus he travailed in
the care of his conceytes, and troubled with those things which long before
were forgotten, at length he came to Wittenberge, a place strongly fortified
with stout Students, and careful Scholemaisters, with brave baristers, and
^aynefull Priests, with painted Prelates, and boisterous Bishops: with covetous
Cardinals, and careless Cloysterers: but these are either the ghostly
Gospellers of God, or the sauerie salt of Satan: these study rather the
Books of Beliall, tha^ the Axiomeas of Aristotle: these candle bearing
taperers, and putrifyed peasants, the insatiable sincke of sin, and workers
of all wickedness, whose lips are always lying, mumbling their Masses, as
though they had already gained the good will of God, when their hearts are as
far from him, as Heaven is from ye Earth* My young master saw these their
sleights, but followed not their fashions: looked still on them, but l^sted not
greatly for their companyes: was contented to behold their mischiefs, but
regarded not to do after their requests: but the silly Fly buzzeth so long
about the flame, that in the end she is scorehed with the fire: and the
crafty Mouse catches so long at the cheese, that she is taken with the
trappe: the Frogge leapeth so often up the bancke, that the Crow catches her:
so fared Narbonus at the first, laughed at their wa^tonnesse, but in the end
was enticed to their wiles: he looked so long on their bravery, that he was
taken with their pride: he gazed so long on their deynties, that he filled
himself with their drugges: now the Tennis courts were claymed his
possessions: the Dancing schools more deyntie for so lovely delights: the
Theaters most grateful for this gaynefull guest: now began he to pluck his
head out of the collar, and pulled his powle into his hoode, renounced all his
forepassed preachings, and denied all ye brag boastings against the
bountiful bravery of Venus courtly crew: and he who was lately so sure a
resistant, is now a faithful defendant contrary his profession, and clean
against the articles of his late belief: he that so lately would watch with
careful Chrisippus, does now sleep with drowsy Endimion: who lately was as
Carterly as Diogenes, is now as Courtly as Paris: he that lately was as loyal
as Laelius, is now as careless as Cresside: but as the kernel must be thrown
into the ground before it will grow a Tree, or like as the Milk must be
bruised before it be Butter, or the tongue of the Parret cut before she will
prate, so must manners be reformed, where remedy is resistant, and affections
brideled, where folly is the foremost, and fancy defaced, where pleasure is the
president: so must the Spanyell whelp be taught to carry, before he assay to
take the water: the Ox to draw with his fellow, before he take the yoke
alone: the Horse ridden with a cloth on his back before he wear the Sadle:
in like manner this tender twigge would yet be bent with one finger: the
roots not run so far into the ground, but they might easily be plucked up
again: the sprigges not yet sprouted so far out, but they might be lopped at
leisure, or proyned at pleasure: but here he was daunted with the blazing
beauty of young Damsels, and regarding the flourishing faces of manerly
maidens: now he beheld runnagate Atlanta, and then the alluring face of lovely
Lays: now the fashions of fine Flora, and the^ the devilish desires of
unfortunate Phaedra: now the filthy lust of beastly Pasiphae, and then the
insatiable desire of baudy Biblis: these filthy factions made so strong a
breach into the tender heart of this youngling, and so broad a battery into
the bowell of his mind, as he imagined himself wrapped out of Hell, into Heaven:
or raised out of the Grave into Paradise: or waked out of a careful slumber,
into a quiet cogitation: now away with these babbling Books, and to what
purpose serves the paltrie pen? now for the study, the Stews: for the chaste
chamber, the choice of chamberers: for ye Studients gown, the Castilian
cloak: for the civil cappe, the flaunting feather: for the comely apparel,
the Italian waste: for spiritual, temporal: and for civility, the
domestical doings: for the seeds of virtue, the blossoms of beastlynesse:
this was the estate of his study, and this the depth of his devises: this the
determination of his dooinges, and this the desperate desires of his dotinge
desaster: this the vnstayednes of so retchles a companion, and this the
sicklenes of so foolish a fondlinge, who would not stick to gage his gown for
a penny worth of pastime, and to burn all his books for a cast at Cards:
neither unknown of the goldsmithes, nor unacquainted with Tailours: as for the
Mercers, either always in their books, or never without their bills: for his
Host^, he could handle him so cunningly, and flatter him so finely, but
rewarded as slenderly, as the husbandman was by the cold Snake that he laid
by the fire: and for that his riches would not reach, nor his substance extend,
to maintain a Pesaunt, or to keep a man to wait on him, ye Sergeants refused
not to take so much pains, or bestow a little labor to wait on this weery
wayfarer, where place did proffer so just an occasion, or time permit to bestow
their diligence: But for that his Uncle was neither unknown, nor he unseen,
his liberty was licensed, and his word taken of his creditours. But as at one
time Phillip lost al Macedon, Antiochus all Asia, the Carthaginians all Libie,
so my young Master with one years study, lost all his Books and sold all
his Lands, which before his Father had so carefullye gotten, and so
custodiously kept for him: and in spendinge thus ydelly his living, he had
almost won the ill will of his Uncle, then the which, there was not any one
thing more against his profit, nor whatsoever otherwise so prejudicial his
estate: all went to wrack, all went to havoc, all goes to decay, all goes
to the spoil: nothing is gained, nor any thing saved: here was bravery,
without honestye, and finenesse without prudencye, coyness not without great
cost, and niceness not without great disprofite: haughtiness with a pennyles
Purse, and stoutnesse, with small wisdom: this was the fashion, this was
after the cut, this was the newest device, and this the dayntiest dealinge:
this the greatest for his credit, and this would purchase him some Privilege:
and if a man should have demanded the cause, or asked the meaning of his
pretense, his answer should have been: his Uncle was commended for so
maintaining him, and what was spente, was for the credit of his Uncle, and a
great praise in himself: his Uncle for maintaininge him so gallantly, and he
for spendinge it so bravely.

O fool, was not this thy discredit? and a greater grief to thy Uncle, to
see thee so fondly given, and to lay the blame upon thy dear freende, who was
so glad of thy well dooinge, and reioysed when he saw thee honestlye given:
thou wast indeed, young of years, but younger in thy dealinges: a Nouice for
thy age, and a child for thy living: green in perfection, and very foolish
in thy outward dealinges.

Behold here Gentlemen, the libidinous lust of licencious liberty, and the
unstaid stedfastnes of a foolish youth: the outrageous rigor of a stately
studient, and the bold blindness of Bayards brat: the unreasonable desires that
drove him forward in this wicked working, and the filthy factions void of all
honesty, and without either mean or measure: the sweet instructions were now
forgotten, and the goulden mean was quite rejected out of his mind: greedy
desire passed the one part of him, and deep disdain was always on the other
side: then belike the Devil daunced just in the middle: and who so fit a
friend for so careless a companion? such Master, such Servant: such Chaplain,
such Parishioners: such Sheep, such a Shepherd: now the dycing houses retain
him, and then the Tauerns hold him: never godly disposed, but always wickedly
minded: never better then mischieuously bente, nor at any time other then
enuiously pretended: as prodigal as could be desired, and as malicious as could
be imagined: and prodigality is commonly the means to pennury, next Neighbor
to beggary, joined with misery, and friend to infelicity, the helper of
licenciousnesse, and neighbor to all wickedness: there he^ plays, there he
prates, there he sweates, there he swears, there he stampes, there he
stares: God is never out of his mouth, and the Devil never from his thought:
he throws the Dice, and the Devil iogges his elbow, then coms sice sincke,
and wisshes the Devil take them, and he stands behind, ready to receive him:
Here flies the Angels without feathers, and there goes the Gold away in
gubbes, the Silver is so slipper that it cannot abide in his Budgettes, and his
coin so cold that it must seek some warmer corner: The Theaters could not
stand, except Narbonus were there, nor the plays go forward unless he
trimmed the Stage: the match was never made, till he was come thither, nor the
bargain any thing worth, till he him self was in place: he must see and be
seen, gaze on others, and be gaped on him self: sometimes to laugh at others,
then to lowre at his own conceits: sometimes to gester, then to use gravity:
sometimes to rejoice, then to be ielous: sometimes to make signs to some Minion,
and then to talk with a trull of trust, who would offer three for one, and for
every stroke strike twice: Here marched Master Cutpurse about so maidenly,
and looked so mannerly, as though wealth were his worste, and coin his smalest
care, yet your hand no sooner plucked from your pocket, but his would be in
your purse as ready as might be, and as diligent as a man would not desire: so
lusty a look as if he liked no such lures, and so stately a countenance, as
if he needed no groates: here walked another mannerly mate with a pair of
blanckes, and a pair of flattes, a pair of langrets, and a pair of stopped
Dice, a pair of barde quater treies, and other Dice of vauntage, they would
give you a cross cast over the thombes, and such a blow on your back, as they
would leave never a penny in a man's purse, but go home with as many faces as
a Sheep: then these consuming caytiffes, and canckred Caterpillars, who would
exchange Gold with Counters, and Silver for counterfeytes: these had also a
place amongst the best, and bare a brain amidst the brauest. Then were there
these bitchlike beastly Bees, whose noses would be slit for the Glanders, and
their tongue cut shorter, that they might prate the better: these would bring
you a bonylasse to your bed, or send you to some good house of credit: these
toys used my young master, till he was as wise as a Woodcocke, and as rich as
a red hearing: his lands were morgaged, and his livings lost: his money al
spent, and he almost at the last cast: and for lack of other exercises, and
wanting other recreations, he practiced the song Schole, and raught so high a
note, but that he mistook sometime his Cliftes, and gave his notes wrong
names: for sol, he sang soulde: for la, all, and for fa, forfayted: all was
sent going, nothing left behind to give his friend: as well monyed, as he that
had just never a Denire: this was the good dealing of my gracious youth: this
the good study he employed: this the gain of his going, and this the profit
he reaped for his liberal lauishing: now he must practice some new devise to
get more coin, and seek some way to put more pence into his pocket: some
subtle shift, or any crafty conueyance, some cast of his learning, or trick
of his cunning: but the Goldsmithes were his friends, and would lend him to his
cost: he paid for his borowing, and those were dear bargaynes: and one amongst
the rest set him so far over the shoes, as he could not get out of the mire
in a long time after. But his Uncle more gracious, than he deserved, and more
beneficial than he merited: more bountifully dealing with him, than he was
courteously able to requite while he lived: more happy was his estate, than
ever he expected it should be: the worst was not ill enough for so careless a
carle, and the most unfortunate too happy for so doltish a dizzard, that
regarded not his living, nor wayed his wealth: regarding neither the spending
of his own, nor the careless consuming of his Uncles. Thus proved he more
lascivious than well studied, and yet better learned, than well nurtured: and
yet his nurture so far excelled his nature which was changed from better to
worsse, as a man would rather have judged him a Homicide, than a Scholar: a
lewd liver before a sure student: a vile loyterer, before a good Doctor. His
Uncle seeing his shifts, and marking his manners, regarding his dealings, and
viewing his naughtiness: looking on his misery, and lamenting the leesing of
his liberty: sometimes thought to use him with rigor, and then again moved
with pity: sometimes thought to forsake him, and then again remembering the
youth of his years: sometimes determined to banish him his sight for ever, and
then again calling to remembrance that his was the motion of his going,
therefore he worthy to be blamed for procuring him to it, doubtful whether to
write or send, yet send he must perforce, unless he would behold his utter
ruin, and not regard the decaying of his estate: he therefore directed by the
messenger a Letter, which more moved Narbonus, then ever any thing that was
said to him before, which was delivered with as great speed, as it was hastily
written: the servant after delivery made of his superscribed Letter, went to
dispatch some business in the Town, promising to return so hastily as he
could dispatch speedely: Narbonus repairing to his Chamber, opened the Letter,
and found that which he before suspected, the tenor whereof ensues.

Sir youth, is your manerly modesty so soon changed to malicious insolency?
your fair words to such foul works? your dutiful obedience, to such filthy
unthriftiness? is your sweet tongue become your bitter bane? your sugared
talk such deadly poison? your plain parting, such deep dissembling? your
godly protestations to such devilish imaginations? Have you thus requited the
guerdon of my good will with such insatiable desires, to spend your living, and
discredit my loyalty? to consume your own portion, and make my name be
called in question, as a maynteyner of your mischiefs, and a partner of your
practices? was all reason banished your breast, and such vile vices possess
the place of your privilege? was neither the fear of God before your eyes?
nor any care of your own state that could turn your heart? was wisdom quite
exiled? and naught but foolishness assailed your society? you a Student? you
one of the Stews: you a Scholar? you a Carter: you a Doctor? nay, a Devil
rather: for these are works of his invention, and matters of his making: you
must fly with Icarus, and fall into the flood: run with Atlanta for the
Golden balls, and leese your Silver substance: vaunt it with Paris, and yet as
poor as Job: Would it fared with thee as it happened with Stilpo, the Town
being lost where he was brought up, and burnt by ill hap, as often come such
chances, seemed neither very well contented, nor greatly displeased: being
demanded how he could take his hapless fortune so patiently, and his unlucky
liberty that was lost so gently: replied, he lost not any thing: for his
riches he carried always about him, which was his learning, but thou have lost
thy living, and found no learning: thou have sucked poison, where thou
should gather honey: reaped thy destruction, where thou should have gained
thy felicity: Has my good desire bred thy bitter bane? my honest wish, thy
hapless woe: my good demeanor thy manifest misery: thou would be at
Heaven, before thou art from the earth: in Paradise, before thou taste any
pleasure: a Prince, before chosen a Magistrate: Thou playest Aesops Dog, lost
the flesh to find the shadow: what should I marvel be the deapth of thy
device, or the fullness of thy pretense, to spend all in hope of nothing, and
to never spare, till all was clean gone: is this the life of a Scholar, and
the profession of a Protestant? the trade of a traveler, and the gain of a
Merchant? the choice of thy doings, and the greatest device of thy meanings, to
set all at sale, and to play all for paltrie, to set up thy rest till
nothing he left: to lay on so lustely, till all be lashed out: thou to
harbor a handsome harlot, have gained the ill will of thy glorious God, to
prancke up thy pride in peeuishe apparel, have lost thy living, and forfayted
thy freedom: thou to please the foolish fancies of some thy feigned friends,
have undone thy self, and won me thy ilwiller: now prove to borow, and see
who will bargayne with thee: those that have gotten thy gold, prove if they
will proffer thee pence: those that thou have laid thy Land to, ask if they
will credit thee with Silver? no trust me: they will pluck their heads out of
the collar, and not know thy name, give thee a gentle gleeke for thy gracious
goodness, and a faithless farewell for thy fond affection: the little Ant
provides her store in Summer, against the biting of Winter: the hiued Be
searches in Summer all the fine flowers, and provides meat enough to serve
till that season return again: the loathsome worms provide against Winter a
hole or house, where they couch them close? why if these simple things without
sense so can serve their own turns, how much more thy self, being one of
the reasonable creatures of God, to whom the imperial seat is given ^uer
other things. Fortunate were the days of thy fostering, and greatly wast thou
delighted in by thy favorable friends: shall therefore the days of thy youth
be lawless? and thy golden time spente in vile vices? God grant thy Senectus
be more satiable, or thy white hears will come but miserably to the grave.
Have thou so soon forgotten thy fathers bounteous blessings, and his careful
constructions, so quickly to have his doings in disdeyne, and to cast behind
thee such sweet sayings? Have thou ere this disliked of thy godly purposes,
not long sithence moved by thy self, and so soon forsaken to tread the path
of thy profitable patrimony? the day draws near the end, when the Sun is
setting, and thou beginnest to walk in misery now thy living is lacking: can
the shaft fly that wants feathers? and what will thou (...) wanting thy
wealth? can the Ship sail surely that has not a helm? can thou wander as
heretofore, lacking thy substance? can thou walk Wittenberge, thy liberty
not permitted, the catchpoule caytiffes will quickly catch thee, and well
worthy of woe, that seeks not his own weal: thou have but thy deserts in
purchasing the prisons, and gettest but that thou long gapedst for in loosing
thy liberty. Though Aeneas lost Tire, yet gained he Libye, and in losing Libye
he found Latium: though the Romans lost the Rhodes, yet retained they the
remaynder of their revenues: though Venus lost the vale of Smirdo, yet gained
she the mount Pelion: had thou kept some parcel, thy loss had bin less
lamentable: and had thou retained but a little of thy portion, the residue
had bin more easily redeemed: The Wine in the vessel will quickly be emptied,
being always drawn on: and thy bags had they bin greater, would soon be
pennylesse, taking out thy money by handfuls: the great Oak once cut up by the
roots, never springs more, but presently dies: but proyne off the sprigges,
and there will grow others green in their places: A little breach in the wall
may be manned to defend a certain space, but the whole wall down, no
remedy will give rescue: a cut upon a man's leg may be healed up again,
but hit at ye heart, naught ensues but present death: but too late comes
rescue when the field is rendered: and not in sufficient time is the man at the
gate when the Horse is out of the pasture: too late comes the pardon, when
the thief is hanged: and too late the clubbes when the fray is parted: too
late it is to plead when judgment is given: and away with the Physician when
the man is dead: But I wear my words in vain, and talk to my self, the
hour is past when the clock has stricken, and now too late to call back
yeesterday: I make strong reasons, if happily they do any thing avail: but
in that there is no remedy against forepassed faults, and recording of
offenses do but wear away the time, use hereafter your self more honestlye,
and I will not utterly reiecte you: learn to bridle your affections, and
content your self with so much as is sufficient your appetite, and forget this
boulstering in bravery, for not to any purpose serves it, but to thy
discredit and my shame. Your years I confess are young, and the government of
your self but small: your weakness therefore shall be borne withal, in hope of
your amendment. My will is therefore, that you make your repair home with
speed, and spend no time in musinge upon matters of nothing: mean while, my
provision shall be prepared for your coming, and what you want, shall be
necessarily provided: Thus for all my sharp sawces, I wish you sweet Sugar,
and after your melancholy meat, pleasant Pills: for in reproouing your vices,
I favor your welfare: and if I cared not for you, I would not have spoken one
word: for though I cast you a bone to bite on, yet would I not have you
choked: and though I have used severity in my sayings, yet wish I you no
cruelty in my dooinges, which you shall try by my goodness, and acknowledge by
the effect of my dooinges: so your manners be reformed in an other kind of
order, and your dealings prove more benificiall to your self, and of greater
credit toward me. Hasten your journey, and post with speed.

Farewell, by your louinge Uncle Henricus, at his house in Vienna.


NArbonus having read the Letter, and wayinge the effect of the contents, his
eyes burst suddenly into a fountain of tears, making a little river, upon
his watery cheeks, looking upon him self, as uncertain whither the Letter
were presented him from his Uncle, or that it were but the flying fancy of
some dream: but perceiuinge it to be true in deed, and no deceiuinge device
that beguiled him, he wept so bitterly, as a man may immagine Peeter did for
his Master: so fast the tears ran from him, and the grief was greater then
the anguish of him that receives judgment, or has his condemnacion
pronounced against him to yield to the torments of death, or to pay his life a
ransom for all wicked doings: his heart did so languish his ill hap, and lewd
life, and his soul lamented his froward fate, and dangerous destiny, as if no
pardon should acquitted him, or any ransom set him free: his soul for a
season in an ecstasy, and his mind so amazed, as if in lamenting, he should
have died, and in dyinge, made some atonement for his sins: such was the
extremity of his passion, and so great the grief of this new received
Letter: for his conscience was guilty, and therefore yielded to the force of his
fancy, led as it were by a legion of resolucions, which way to take, or what
was best be done: but in the end, perceiving his own folly, and musing at his
madness, in that children do cry, and Women weep: not men to complain in such
order, or lament with ye leesing of a few tears, but should bridle up their
affections, and moderate their maladies in such order, as their weepinge will
neither avail in their demeanes, nor tears be any testimony of their
treacherous toys: his thoughts altogether inflamed with fury, and his mind
moved with the measure of his malady, uttered these words to himself, and
spoke as follows.

And is it true Narbonus, that thy Uncle has dealt with thee after thy
doings, and rewarded thee according to thy works? and if he do so, is it
more then I merit, or other then my deserts are? no trust me, nor so much:
for were it so, how could I ever look upon him again? could my heart have
power, or my lips be so bold, to crave a thing so unreasonable? or to ask
that, which in conscience I cannot desire, his pardon to be granted, which
will not be denied, durst I attempt it, or put it in practice, whose care has
been so comfortable and aid fo assistaunt, in all these my doubtful
dealinges and desperate desasters: how shall I utter one sweet word? no it will
be so sour, as he will hardly digest it: can I imagine any collusion to
cloak my craft withal, or frame any excuse to hide my folly: Why had I not
been called? I had stayed in the Country, and not come to Vienna: but my
calling was for commodity, and willed for my welfare: but being informed of
my wanton life, was wished to spend my time more honestly: but I was sent to
Wittenberge, to learn the Law, and to profit my self in learning: but my
sendinge was not to learn wit of a Woodcocke, or wisdom of him that knows
not what it means: but I was sent like a Trauailer, therefore my expenses the
greater, but my living should have bin like a Citizen, and so my credit been
made larger: but had I not been caused, I had consented: but the choice was
mine own, and the refusal was in my making: but had I not bin exhorted, I had
stayed at home in the Country: and had I stayed at home, my living had not
been lost: but mine was the consent, and mine the motion: mine the
demaundinge, and mine the requestinge: mine the wishing to obtain, therefore
mine must be the blame, and mine the shame, and mine the repentance, for none
shall smart but my self, nor any feel the foil, but he that began the
battle. The spending of my lyuinge, has proved me a lewd loyterer, and
the losing of my lands a right Abbey lubber: first I should have gotten, and
then freely spent: first spare, then used: first gained, and then gratified:
first found franckely, and then laid on liberally. But caitiffe that I am, and
most wretched, amongst other unfortunate: now I speak what I should done, now
what my pretense might have been, now I speak my mind, that it is to late,
and utter what before was to be remedied: And why could not my estate be
stayed as before? and my doing dealt in so good order as before they were? now
shall my own rod, be the remedy for such a royster: and my own staff my
stale for so foolish a harbinger, the stay of my simple state stolen away, how
shall my life be prolonged? what shall I but morn in misery, and pine in
perplexity? But were these Letters sour? and were they not also sweet? if
they were bitter, yet were they tooth some? and though they were sharp, yet
were they comfortable: he began roughly, but ended gently: reproved me sharply
at ye beginning, but entreated me favorably at the end: though he began with
rigor, yet ended he with reason: with rigor, nay with justice rather: for to
punish offenders is a thing commended in the laws of God, spoken by his own
mouth, and affirmed in the holy Scriptures: why then should I escape, or be
forgiven? why should I not be paid my deserts, and repayed according to
justice? my case deserves to be for ever rejected, and never to atteyne the
friendly favor of my gracious Uncle again: but seeing his goodness (...)
offered me such favor, his friendly countenance so requited my unjust deserts:
he like a good Shepe^ear^e (...) called me home one of the lost flock: I
receive his grateful good will, and rejoice so in his good offer (...) erst I
despaired ever to atteyne his favor again.

Sailing amidst these contrary cogitations, and blowinge the coals of his
boiling breast, his Unckles man, who had dispatched his affairs, and ended his
business, entered the Chamber, finding him more pleasantly disposed than he
looked for, and yet perceiving by his countenance that he had read the contents
of his pasported letter, and found that which both comforted his stomach, and
griped him at the gall: both eased his malady, and increased his grief: both
moved his patience, and framed his welfare, to whom Eubulanus his Unckles man
spoke as follows.

Sir Narbonus, you have I trust this tractable time of my absence, and the
while of this my long delay deliberated upon the contents of my masters
letters, and found at full the effect of their meaning, pleases you therefore
to reanswere them, I purposely stay upon their speedy dispatch, for to defer
time serves now to small purpose, and to stay longer than the importance of my
business requires, were great charge^, without likelyhoode of any profit: he
willed me to make have, and not to stay longer than of necessity I must, or
forced to expect your answer: for (said he) my Nephew will come I think with
you, and will not cause you stay upon any matter, or prolong any time about any
thing, whatsoever: which if you purpose to go, or have set down with your
self to put in execution, I beseech you let it be with speed, and applied
with have the greatest that may be, for the sooner we are going, with more
speed will be our ariuall, and the longer we stay, the more will be our charge.

Gramercies, good Eubulanus, answered Narbonus, for thy dutiful diligence in
doing me this pleasure: and I thank thee for the secret care thou had in the
delivery of these my Letters: as for my good Uncle, I find this his
goodness so great, and his kindness so much, that so far as my life shall
reach, and the uttermost bounds of my health permit howsoever, I shall be
found ready to die at his feet, and to offer my soul a sacrifice, to do him
such small pleasure, as my little life will permit: as for thy great pains
and careful diligence, shall be referred till some other time, and driven off
for a more grateful good turn, till God grant me somewhat more liberally to
bestow on thee, and send me to requite the uttermost of thy good will:
meanewhile, take ye forfaiture of my faith, and the troth plighted of one yt
will not deal double, as a most just gage, and a perfect pledge to pleasure
thee howsoever.

Sir, reanswered Eubulanus, these small deserts and little gratulations which I
dutifully have done, and obediently fulfilled, were forced by fear, and
constreyned by commandment by your Uncle, and my Master, which of duty
extended so far, and therefore could do no less, except I should have showed
my self undutiful, or restreyned my service: this therefore, neither meriteth
praise, nor deserves any favor: but if fortune be so friendly, or my hap so
happy, that in matters of magnanimity, or works of weight, my simple service
might be seen, or my willing mind made manifest, the duty to my master
reserved, and my obedience toward him excepted, you should not find any want
of good will, or my duty worthy blame, so far as my small power were limited,
or within the compass of my life whatsoever.

Narbonus giving him the choice of a thousand thanks, and offering him any
courtesy for his great good will, showed the effect of his hasty letters, and
the posting speed that they required: that his Unckles pleasure was, he
should with speed come to Vienna, and not to make longer tariance, than
necessity required, or the cause of the staying would permit: they therefore
causing their Horses to be in readiness, and trussing up such trinckets as
they could, departed the morning ensuing, almost without taking leave of any,
or giving a friendly farewell to his old friends, and ancient companions.

These wayfaring travelers, and rank riders, on their way toward Vienna,
and some part of their journey passed, discoursed of sundry matters, and the
estates of diverse towns, so of their own Weal public, and of the Town of
Vienna, then of the Father of Narbonus, and so of his Uncle.

Sir said Eubulanus, this your journey was framed in have, and furnished in
post: no sooner determined, than ended, and no sooner thought on, then put in
practice: but had you known before the law to have bin so laxatiue to your
pursse, and so perverse to your purpose, I think you would either have
constreyned the country to kept you, or bin content your Unckles house should
have holde^ you.

Truth Eubulanus, for the law is laborsom, and very tedious, and no loytering
lozell may atteine unto it, or any trifling student ever come near ye
perfection thereof: as for the country, my care was consolation, and my hardest
hap blisseful bale, the worst weal was great joy, and nothing contr^ried my
purpose, or disliked my doings. But Sir, if your study had bin strained, and
your wit rejected, you might have atteined, which now must uneaths be
gainsaide.

I Eubulanus, had Alexander known after his valiant victories, and great
co^quests of the third part of ye world, he should have left his life so soon,
or bin poisoned in Babylon, he would never have entered ye walls, or come within
the gates: and had Narbonus known yt Wittenberge had bin so full of wiles, or
this study any thing so tedious, he would never have tarried the turning over
of three leaves, or the reading of one Author.

Truth Sir, but you have bought your wit before it was taught, and paid for
your learning more than is worth: but the coult must be used to the bitte
before he come to the saddle, and the wanton whelp must be taught to carry a
glove, before he diue at a Ducke.

I Eubulanus, had I been restrained like a Coult, I had not proved my self
such an ass: and had my liberty been lackinge, as wisdom would it should: my
dooinges had not proved so foolish, nor my pretenses so vain: but as I pay
dear for my learning, so is my sorrow the greater: and as my cost was
chargeable, so is my mind moved with the spending of my living: but time
already passed cannot be called back, and the Tide tarieth not the leisure of
any man.

Well quoth Eubulanus, your fall will prove your felicity, and better now be
taught your trick of training, then hereafter have proved your painful
repenting.

In deed answered Narbonus, first wit, and then wisdom, to have is good hap,
and to hold fast a great virtue: for Narbonus could have said thou have it: but
now he can not say thou hold it.

Truly Sir replied the other: Your Unckles careful consideracion, will be the
cause of your consolation: and to submit your self duetifully, will both
purchase you pardon, and make you be deemed of, as your self will desire.

In deed answered Narbonus, he that yields, is often saved: but I will not
only submit my self, but also duetifully do whatsoever my good Uncle shall
command me.

With these pretty propoundings, and pleasant replies, their journey seemed
shorter, and their travail not so tedious: but when they arrived at their
iourneyes end and came into the house of Henricus, Narbonus was doubtful what
to say, how to frame his words, or in what order to utter them, in what manner
to submit him self, and how his Uncle would take the matter: but spying in
the end his Uncle coming toward him, could not hold his eyes from weeping,
and his heart from throbbing, to whom he spoke.

Sir, the prodigal child, after the ri^tous spending, and wilful wasting of
his careless goods, humbly submitting himself, and craving pardon for his
faults, was received into favor as before, and obtained pardon, that deserved
for ever to be rejected. Alexander the great never put any to the sword that
yielded to his person, or asked mercy at his hands. Anthony submitting
himself, and offering to die before the Emperor that sought his death, and
pronounced his punishment, was received into former favor, and restored to his
ancient dignities. My merits dear Uncle deserve no less than for ever to be
rejected out of your favor: and my doings if right were rewarded with justice,
have gained me your everlasting displeasure: but presuming upon your patience,
and suing my pardon before so merciful a Judge, I need no solicitor to move
my case, or any Attorney to answer but my self, but that your goodness has
gained me undeservedly, that my ungraciousness should never have merited: and
with those words, the tears trickled so fast down his cheeks, and his
thoughts so troubled his guilty conscience, as he could not speak any more, or
utter the effect of his meaning.

His good Uncle at the sight whereof was so moved with compassion, and touched
at the quick, as his inward grief did counteruayle Narbonus outward tears,
he therefore embracing him, and holding him between his arms? said:

Dear Nephew, that which is passed already, can not now be called back to be
amended: and that which is done, can not be undone again: to record them
therefore in order, or turn them over from point to parcel, would be a great
grief to you, and not any pleasure to me: My self I know was sometimes young
as thy self, and no doubt those pleasures then liked me, which now do delight
thee: but let herafter my wisdom rule thee being unreasonable, and my
instructions persuade thee being holesom for thy health: for that which is
past, I drown it in the flood of forgetfulness, and never pretend to make
rehearsal of it again: comfort therefore thy weery spirits and be careful of thy
own safeguard, so shall thou find me a faithful friend, and one yt seeks thy
wished desires as well as thy self: Thus was his good Uncle pacified with his
humble submissio^, and him self contented to hear his pardon pronounced.

Thus is Narbonus now in Vienna again, free from the checkes of any, and
clear of the penalties done to his creditours: where he turns over his
time, and accompanies some of equal disposition to his own, and some
contrary his calling, yet some flatterers, some foysters, some coggers, some
cauellers, some brablers, some brawlers, some dissemblers, some dangerous,
some Caterpillars, some courteous, some faithful, some faithless, some
honestly disposed, some maliciously minded, some sure friends, some rank
rebels: There resorted to him as well the Droane, as the Be: as well the
Spider, as the Fly: as well the Kyte, as the Dooue: but Narbonus had learned
his stop Galiarde, and could as satiably sooth, as soberly solace, for he paid
for his practice, and lent liberally, for small usury: Among the rest of the
fragrant flowers and sweet Uiolets that followed Narbonus, and accompanied him
always: there was a Gentleman named Phemocles, of behavior honest, and of
grace grateful, for Parentage one of the best, and for wit sufficiently stored:
with lyuinge well furnished and with good qualities very well endued: These two
Youths grew into acquaintance and familiarity, and so into lykinge and love:
and from well lykinge to such amity, and confederacy of fidelity, as they
missed not one day where there was not some gratulation or a little feruency of
fidelity demonstrated from each to other. On a time taking the holesom air,
and walking in ye wild feelds, where not so much as a bush should be partaker
of their prayers, or a bird be acquainted with their doings, Narbonus spoke
unto Phemocles as follows.

My beloved Phemocles, as there is not any weal which is not mixed with some
woe: no felicity, but some way federated with instabilitie: no ancient amity,
but tied together with some treachery, by reason of some freendly foes: or by ye
mutability of fickle fortune: so we whose weal is not ye worst, whose happiness
not ye lest: whose freendship not faithles, must fortify our fantasies against
dangerous dealings, as we neither be drawn with their drugs, nor enticed with
their trumperies: neither allured to their lusts, nor infranchised to their
follyes: neither won to their wiles, nor wedded to their wanto^nes: neither
trusting to their trifles, nor tied to their toys: If they assault us with
society, we will keep them company, and dissemble our amity: if they seek us,
we will shun them: if they follow us, we will fly from them: if by chance
against our choice, we willingly walk with them: we may protest our old
profession, and fained some fickle excuse to depart, and avoid them: for where
there are many, there is maliciousness: and where great company, small
constancy: When we are in the Town, we must walk ciuely: when in the Feelds,
disport our selves with honesty: when in the streats, talk soberly: when close
in our Chambers, use mirth and melody: when amongst company, fare as if we
loved al alike: when by our selves manifest the depth of our desires: the one
will be greatly for our credit and honesty, the other will double our joys,
and put all suspicion to exile and infamy: I speak Phemocles by experience,
as I proved smally for my profit, as you are not ignorante, for that my
doings are manifest. When I was in Wittenberge I wanted there no wayters, we
here in Vienna need woo for no suitors: you see what resort we retain, and
what fellows do fawn on us, what a train does tr^upe by us, and how many
hang on our sleeves? more for favor, than for fancy: more for substance, than
for our safety: more for gain, than for goodness: more for that they think
to coin some commodity, than truly to testify their faithfulness and
honesty: in time they may win us to their wills, and allure us to their
alleageances: in time they may cause us to like that we hated, and loath that
which we loved: in time they may frame us to their follies, and gain us to
perform that which we utterly rejected: to avoid therefore an imminent
danger, is a warrant of wisdom: and to fly the faculties of flatterers,
deserves no little praise, but great commendations: we may bear a fair face
to all, but not join in amity with any: welcome all, but bid none stay
dinner: embrace all courteously, but reward all slenderly, for our own
affairs, and our own business whatsoever: what my little help may stand you in
stead: what my small substance may pleasure you: what my devices may profit
you: I shall be as willinge to employ, as you are to crave my help: as gladly
to obey, as you gracious to command: as pressed at all times to fulfill al
things: as you desirous at any time to compel me whatsoever: and for my faith
toward your favor, you shall find it as bountifully bestowed in every
respect, as your heart can wish, or your self desire: And if Damon were
faithful to Pithyas: if Lepidus to Laelius: if Pilades to Orestes: In like
manner shall Narbonus be faithful to Phemocles, while life does last, and til
death separate our two bodies: in pawn of which pledge, I can gage you no
other but my hand in the habit of my heart, and were my heart so franckly to be
offered, as my hand ready to be rendered, it should be as bountifully pawned, as
I have dutifully demonstrated.

Phemocles long expected this maidenly motion, and harkened a great while for
that preached Sermon: and at that very instant had resolved him self, to have
made the price, if he had not bidden so fair for the bargain: but his
determination bare always this imagination, that to resolve was better then to
propound and pay for the price, easier then to set sale in a Market, to whom
he repaide this resolution, and gratefully requited with this courteous Conge.

Sir Narbonus, you made the demand, and I am to reply an answer: which had
you not asked since we made our meetinge, I should have requested before our
departing: your instructions are so comfortable, and your meditacions so
medicinable, as I may neither leave the one nor forsake the other: your perfect
approbations by experience of your bought wit, and my wisdom unpaid for,
do serve for a profitable prerogative, for so simple a Sophist, as has
neither learned his rules of Rethorick, nor discovered his card of Collusion:
our Town in deed is so fraughted with a frontire of fools, so larded with
lubbers of the laieitie, so tapistred with shiftinge shauelinges, and nosegay
Nuns, and so powdered with pickthankes in their public profession, that when
a man thinks he has God by the hand, he has the Devil by the heel.
Thus we live like the bird that is nourished under the Crocadiles mouth, when
we think our selves most sure, then in deepest danger: and when our state
most staide, then most tickle: As for you that have felt the hand of Hercules,
may easily endure a tacke with a twigge, but Phemocles whose physic has no
need to be tried by purgations, nor certainty, proved by any manner of
subtlety, is so tied to your trustiness, and bound to your bosom, that
distill him what drench you will, and he is content to drink it, or prove him
by what means you list, and he is willing to abide it: and this town
retayneth Doctors physical, and Physicians crumenicall, the one for the bodily
pain, the other for the pursely pleasure, whereof though you wanted not in
Wittenberge, yet we will avoid them in Vienna: my proof is no privilege, and
my knowledge without practice, the one I learned but a little, and the other I
have it by heresay. To acknowledge acquaintance, is a motion that proceeds
from the heart of some. Again, others make an outward show, when they mean
nothing less: for my part, your goodness has gained so deep a devotion in
the bowels of my heart, as the doors shall never be opened to any other
whatsoever: and as the wife of Demetrius, who disdeined not to run Lackeylike
by the loving side of her sweet husband, in that tedious time of his
turmoyling travel: in like manner shall Phemocles not refuse to carry the
cross of Narbonus in his unfortunate afflictions, but take his teritorie
toils, tempered with the state of instabilitie, as a platform of prowess in
so simple a Souldioure, that works without the wiles of crafty coniurations,
and deals without the counsel of any fine Southsayer: And as your friendly
faith is federated without any spot of infamy: your dealings, without deserts
of my doings: your aleageances, without my alurements: your perfect promises,
without my painful perfourmances: so as far as my rules will reach, and my
mind move me, my fidelity shall show my fancy: my trial shall pronounce me
no Traitor: my faith vnfalsified, shall manifest me no other, than a trusty
Troylus: though I soar high, yet will not I prove haggardlike, but stoop to
the lure of loialtie, to the very feet of your courtesy: but to daunt of a
man's doings is varletlike, and to boast bravely, in faining to be friendly, is
foolish faith without any sign of feruencie, and a coining of curiosity, with
show of little performance as may be: but yet think not that I can either lie
for my liberty, nor prate partially: neither argue agility, nor stain
sternitie: nor proudely perticipate my periudicialitie, nor ranckly royst it
with beastliness and bravery: but assure your self, that my doings shall be
joined with the hope of honesty, to do the duty of a devout Uotarie, and in
place of Agere, to put Satisfacere: with might and maine, with heart and hand,
with tooth and nail, never cease to serve you, and never leave off to
prosecute your pleasure: and if the imperfection of my ability may
sufficiently satisfy the desire of your loyalty, believe me if you list, no
one in ye world whomsoever, shall cause me change my choice, nor retire in my
reentrie, selling my self slave unto your person, and yielding you that which
no others shall possess: for ye faithful perfourmance of which promises, and
the true meaning of my clear conscience, take here my right hand, that member
next my heart, a reward altogether insufficient, and too simple a dish for so
worthy a Master: and could I give you better, you should not have worse God is
my Judge, whom I call as witness, to testify my troth, and manifest my mind
plighted to your person, and rendered to your gracious goodness.

Behold here Gentlemen a lincked league of amiable amity, with a quick
confederacy, and speedy dispatch of two friends erst unknown, now so jointly
joined, and so perfectly united, as no means shall make mutabilitie, or any
device dissolve their amity: no bale, that shall be bitter, n^ fortune froward,
no chance that shall be chapman in their choice: no grief aggrauate their
glory, nor any diuelishe deeds of dissension sown amidst the forrowes of
their faith, that shall hinder the fellowship of their fidelity, or by any
means undo the linckes of their loyalty, but that which shall grow for their
greedy gains, and certainly serve for their security in what affairs
soever, frowning fortune be interchangeably annexed.

These plights of parliance ended, with the contents of covenants, and the
joining of hearts and hands, they both departed the floured fields, and
pleasant pastures, as well contented, as they desired, and as fully satisfied,
as they both wished. Going into the Town to dinner, they fed on the
confections of their preter promises, and glutted themselves with their former
talk, the rest of the day they spente in their antie^t customs, and sweet
talkings. Drawing toward night, and that the day waxed near spent, each gave
to other ye Baselos manus, and a freendly farewell for ye night: and hard it was
to be adjudged, whether Narbonus for his peereles purchased friend, and loving
co^panio^ were best contented, or Phemocles for ye inward insolutio^ of his
preoptated desire, or most favorable felicie best pleased: but this is most
certain, and the truth very manifest, that the interior instigation of the
habitation of the heart, or the resting place of the thoughts was so ravished
with the remembrance of their most delightful daliances, or new conceived
joys, that their hearts could wish to have, or their souls desired to see,
was for the time so senseless, or void of any feeling, as if the mind moved as
it were with heavenly motions, or filled with angelical contemplations, were
drawn from earthly thoughts, and called from terrestrial cogitations, into
the heavenly harbor of al happiness, or the private Paradise of most deyntie
devises. But having put on their former perplexity, and digested those
pleasant drugges, they were after so armed with amorous amplifications, and so
drowned in their former preambulations, as melancholies for a season was
utterly abolished, and all bitter heaviness vanished out of their stomachs,
and their thoughts dropped with honny, that erst were gorged with gall: Thus
fared it with our two friends, and thus swamme they in their secure safeties:
Narbonus would not have changed his choice, or sought such another friend, to
gain so much goods as he before forfaited, or to find more jewels, than his
back would bear: As for Phemocles, his case better liked him, than if he
should have gained all the wealth of Cressus, or had all the passing pearls of
Arabia.

Narbonus came to his Chamber after his former fashion, and old accustomed
manner, thinking to try the strings of his loving Lute, or to fill his ears
with Music as he had done, but his heart hopped so without a Harp, and
dau^ced in delights without a Musition, as if he had then bin married with some
dayntie delights, or using something for his felicity, the greatest in the
world.

Phemocles departed also to his stately stacion, or earthly mansion: where in
stead of rest, he was received with rejoicing: and for his bed and boulster,
the late battle of their imbracinges bounced so in his brains, and troubled
so his toyish thoughts, as he iested of his joy to him self, and laughed
with inward lust of his happy felicity: if the one were daunted with
inestimable desires, and drowned in the dew of terestriall triumphs: the
other was fatted with the fruition of his fantacies, and abolished the beauty
of all other braueries, bathing himself in the beatitude of that protrated
picture, and seemly Saint: which though he bare it not in his shining
shield, yet he ware it in the womb of his heart, and kept it in as privily as
a Jewel of great price: Who can best say for others safety, and best praise
others perfection, spares not for speaking, neither tarieth for entreating:
and the more to augme^t their antiquity of amity, and prolong the length of
their loyalty, they were not every hour in their Oratories, nor every morninge
in their meetinges, not every day in their daunces, nor always in their
daliaunces: for who has not the faculty of this facility? or who not the
knowledge of this plain misery, that a little absence makes a deep desire,
and the restraining of being together, makes the meetinge more joyful? for
they so tempered their affections, and so dyeted their desires, that every
meetinge was as gainefull as the first, and every greeting as benificiall as
the frontire of their felicity: If they met, it was by mere chance, and they
never poynted any time of parlyance: their departure was with ^aynefull
protestations, and their encountering with amiable affiances: they took their
leaves, as if they should have left their lives, where at their next meeting,
their hearts hopped like the careful Captain coming home with conquest, or
reioysed like him that had escaped the hands of his enemies: for, is the
extremity of the passion of the Citizen comparable the unspeakable rejoicing
of the Souldioure? no trust me, for the joy of the one is at all times alike,
and not greater this day, than the morrow following always without danger of
death, and ever without loss of living: but the other having escaped the
scouring, or bidden the brunt, returns with triumph, furthered with felicity,
revived (as it were) from the grave: therefore rejoices without measure, and
his gladness as much as may be thought. But fortune disdayning their happy
felicity, and envious at their prosperous proceedinges, murmuring at the
multitude of their mirth, and hating their heavenly happiness: frowning at the
goodness of their gladness, and having in contempt the depth of their
desasters, caused their separation by a quick dispatch, and provided their
departures so suddenly, as might be, found a means to put the one far enough
from the other, and had a device to make them part company, imagined a craft to
make a dangerous distance of their merry meetinges, and invented a drifte to
drown their doing for a time: And no marvel if it were so, for what is
otherwise? is not the flower to day finely flourishing: to morrow stamped under
feet? the tree in summer fresh and green, in winter naked, and bitten with
frost? the Heart with his haughty horns, fat and fair, shortly after cold and
ready to sterue: the man that to day bounceth in bravery, to morrow marches in
the vale of misery: do we not commonly see the stout tyrant to day persecuting,
to morrow to stand to the mercy of his inferiors? to day in Fortunes lap, to
morrow in the mire of misery? We have but two chances, and both we cannot
enjoy together, good, or evil: happy, or unfortunate: blessed, or cursed:
wisdom should either show us thus much, or reason rule us to understand this
secrecy: to day we have, to morrow we had: to day men, to morrow lumps of earth:
to day in the highest habitacion of felicity, to morrow in ye lowest sincke of
adversity: the infant dies, the old fool tarieth still: the green grass
withers, the toughe old tree abides still in his place: as commonly goes
the little Lamb to the slaughter, as the old Ox to th butchery: let us not
be deceived with the mutability of the one, nor beguiled with ye uncertainty of
the other: after the uncomfortable night, comes the clear day: after
wallowinge waves, and sturdy storms, quiet calmes, and sweet gales: after
tedious travails, temperate tastes: after misery, mirth: after Melancholy,
melody: after bitter bale, blisfull beatitude: as we cannot enjoy both, so
must we perforce want one: our lincked lovers, whose fancies were their food:
whose delights their desires: whose wishes their welfare: whose joy was the
greatest: and whose gravity the least: swam all this while in the seas of
security, and marched in the frontire of felicity, were forced to fly the
feeld of their confederacy, and resign the banners of society, to time the
only means to enjoy their ancient amity, and to find out the happiness of
their former felicity: they had all this while tasted the apple, but not
touched the rind, cracked the nut for the curnell, but let fall the shell:
gathered the grapes, and left the leaves: But now ye Drum sounds, and the
Pipe plays lofte to depart: for ye father of Phemocles envying at the lasy
life of his loitring son, and desirous to have him better busied in the
spendinge of his time, determined to send him to Naples, to learn the Italian
tongue, which would greatly profit him as he imagined: to whom findinge at
convenient leisure, and time to unfold the effect of his meaning, he spoke
as follows, and uttered these words.

Son Phemocles, he that always abides by the fire side, or in the warm
house, little knows how hardly he can abide the freesing frostes, or cold
blastes of winters winds, to remain always within the City, or to abide
still in the Town, is no means to prove a good Courtier, or to see such
service as the Prince desires: to march in a Meddow amongst maidens, or to
lie lulling in the lappes of Ladies, is not the way to prove a good Soldier,
or to be practiced in the feats of Arms, thou fightest here but with thy
fancy, and striuest with thy own estate: thou always hopest, but never
gainest: you think, to attain somewhat, but find just nothing: the
fruition of thy freedom, is no light of thy living, nor the inioyinge that
thou already haste, a mean to make it more, unless thy vsinge were put to
working, and thy sauinge to encrasing: the money in thy pursse will not
increase, but the bay salt will grow as it lies: thy little knowledge seeking
for no more experience, will profit very slowly, but thy wit being wrested,
may in time win thee great wealth: the wearing away of thy goodly years
without commodity, and the leesing of thy time without any utility, thou
will hereafter repent, and wish thou had bin forced more for thy felicity.
As thou want knowledge, so lackest thou also wisdom, and with the
atteyning of the one, thou shalt easily find the way to gain the other: and
as thou want understanding, so must thou prove with pains, and not think
to win it with wishing: I speak not to the end to have thee either
Souldioure or seruitour: neither rouer nor royster: neither Courteour nor
Caterpiller: but in going, thou may gain, and yet not get without pain, and
thy pain doubtless will prefer thee to profit, and thy profit will prove so
for thy pleasure, as thy gain shall not seem painful, nor thy profit
hurtful. Understand thou therefore, and be it known unto thee, that the
better to talk with strangers, and the easier to answer many demandes, the
more profitable for thy parentage, and the greater comendable for thy Country,
the more to pleasure thy self, and the better to delight me: then take thy
journey to Naples, and leave thy natural seat this City, there to learn the
Italian tongue, and to see the fashions of that Country, a place as I imagine
as likely for thy learning, as prompt for thy profit, yet perhaps more
beutified with bravery, than subject to the rules of honesty, exceeding full
of courtesy, and filled with filed flattery: more coy then comely, and yet
more comely than commendable: their faces painted like ye Appothecaries pot,
shines outwardly, but poisoned inwardly: and were their doings correspondent
to their sayings, their companyes were to be craved, where now it is to be
hated. When thou shalt be come thither, and stayed in the Town, look not on
their painted posts, nor have any regard to their wanton windows: gaze not on
their garish girls, nor listen not to their Sirenes songs, whose Lutes will
entice thee to lust, and their music move thee to do that thou after repent:
thou shall find there new fangles, and trifling toys: tibbes and trulles:
knauerie and bawdery: villainy and variety: But as thou have eyes to behold
these things, so have thou also a Soul to think upon to save: for let it be
no sooner known of thy arrival, and judging thee to be a stranger, but the
next morning, or happily that same night, some Curtizan will salute thee with
a sweet song under thy window, or else with a Citherne at thy Chamber door:
but give no ear to such gratulations, nor have any regard to those
salutations, reward her slenderly with some little piece of Silver, or pay her
that shall not counteruaile her travel, so may thou perhaps be dispatched
of a Strumpet, and leese the company of a beastly body: but if thou seem to
dally, or to make any account of her, thou shall ever be troubled with her
sight, or mollested with her sound, won with her sweet words, or allured
with her loving looks: deceived with her painted pride, or delighted with her
pretty posies: her eyes as good as fishing baits, and her hands hold like
limetwigges. If society assail thee to crave the company of some trusty
Titus, or gain the good will of some faithful Iesippus: thou must bear two
heads in one hoode, or be repaied treble for single: and once gained love
that he likes, his lover excepted, or his Lady only restrained, and then,
except thou can flatter, thou must not live, and whom thou acquaintest thy
self withal, or make thy companyon, will look to crow over thee, or go
about to maintain some mischief against thee: therefore to live without any
of them, and to use them al alike, were the best in my mind, and the surest for
thy safeguard. Could thou so temper thy traditions, and frame thy fragilitie
to work thy utility, for let him disdeine thy doings, or loath thy loyalty,
if in working thy own welfare, thou unwillingly trouble his testy temperance:
if in gaining thy gracious glory in any respect, you gratify not his gredy
gulf, to his co^tentment though smally to thy easement: if in talkinge thou
trouble him, or in walking thou wring him, in speakinge to any thou give not
him leave to be before thee, or in saluting thou suffer him not be first
satisfied, thou shall purchase thee his displeasure, and win him thy ennimy: in
banquetinge thou must spend franckly, and in feastinge feed him finely: one
way thy courtesy will increase thy care, and the other way thy loyalty augment
thy sorrow: thou must sooth him sweetly and praise him with perpetuity: bear a
brain as if thou would banquet him, and make boast of his bravery: flatter
him to his face, and dissemble with him to his very lips: For if by thy honest
behavior thou purchase him thy peer, or by thy goodness thou gain his
gratitude: by thy loyalty, thou purchase his liberty: by thy honest deserts,
thou win him as thou would wish: Alas, when thou have fished so long, thou
shall find but a Frogge, and gained what thou can get: thou shalt^ have
but a flittinge freende, or a faithles foe: thou shalt reap but Cockell for
thy corn, and Thistles in the stead of Grapes: Brambles in the place of
Apples, and Briers in the room of Figs: for when to do him any pleasure thou
may, thou shall happily displeasure thy self, the least look, or the
smallest word, the least dicurtesie, or the smallest qualitye, the least
frumpe, or the smallest froward face will procure him practice thy perdicion,
and sell thy self to some Lozell, hired for a little lucre, and rather then
fail, or be deceived of his purpose, he will himself under the pille of an
Apple, convey a dram of poison, or foyst some Fig to seal thee a Pasporte of
farewell to thy friends, or give thee some drench of little delight, good for
the Bottes, but ill for the belly: then must his hair be curled after the
cut, or frizled after the finest fashion, his Mouchachos, Turkylony like, and
his Beard his God, his belly boulsfred as their fashion is, and his Rapier
after the newest device: his face must be washed and froathed, and his ruffes
seemly set: his Hose brusshed, and his Shoes wiped: then walks he so
mannerly, and treads so stately: marches so warily, and saluteth so
courteously, that you will say he resembles a Saint, when in troth he is
as proud as Lucifer: if he espy you to talk with his wife, to use conference
with his Lover, or to move any question to her whom he calls his friend, you
may then look for his rusty Rapier to rumble in your belly, or his stubbed
Poynard to give you the Stabbado, you never the wiser, and he little the
better: I speak not to this end Phemocles, neither imagine my meaning to be
such, that thou should refrain all company, or remain always in the
Melancholy chamber, but admonish thee whom thou intertayne, and of whom thou
art entreated: with whom thou accompany, and with whom thou art acquainted:
whom thou choose thy friend, and how thou shall find few faithful: As I would
have thee liberal, so would I not have thee lauishe: as spend, so not spoil:
as willinge, so not wilful: as for play, I know thee to be no gamester: and
for drinking, no Tavern hunter: thou may for recreacion use the Tennis
Courts, and the dancing Schools, to refresh thy weary spirits: but the
Theaters in any wise refrain, and all such mischeuous motions: and here in the
benificiality of my blessings, and as you will retayn me your fatherly friend:
refrain the company of Curtizans, and disdain the fellowship of Harlots, who
will quickly peer in your pocket, and empty your purse: laugh in your face,
and cut your throat: profess you great good will, and work you some villainy:
to abandon your body to their bravery, you shall sell your soul to the Devil:
I will therefore with your consent, and in that it is likely to be profitable
your estate, that such necessaries as are wantinge be with speed provided, and
those things which you have not, may hastily be made ready: for in prolonginge
your pilgrimage, you do but delay your desires, and the thing once gained
that you go for, so speedy return may be made as shall seem good in your
likinge.

Phemocles stood all the pronouncing of this penalty, and the reading of this
enditement, like the picture of S. Peeter, or the image that Pigmalion wrought:
for this he wayed in his wavering mind, and cast these doubts in the
habitation of his head, that to depart from him whose company he craved so
much, and to forsake that good fellowship of his late purchased friend, for
whose sake, he would with Orpheus have gone down into Hell, or have ventred to
gain the golden fleece, or to have tried his strength with Gorgons head, to
have had his happy desired freende with him, or to use his good instructions
in that tedious travel, and long voyage: then contrariwise, the request of his
father was so prestricte, and his commands so straight, to deny which motion,
or to gainesay his pretense, would cause him be disliked, which before was so
well loved: he armed therefore his amorous mind with the heritage of hope, and
fenced his fancy with the friendship of a favorable return. So soon as he
had bought his bargain, or learned his lesson, yet the time he knew would
seem tedious, though it were but half a year, and that too long, had it bin
less, but that he minded should be the most, and the uttermost day should not
be more, but he reckned without his host, and told his cards false, the more
his grief, as afterward it proved, and the greater his sorrow, as after it
ensued, he shaped therefore this resolute answer, and replied as follows.

Dear Father, I should seem either very prodigious to renounce your
reasonable request, or very mallaparte to brag before I have bidden the
battle, either very foolish to deny your demaundes, or very doultish to drive
of doubts with delays: either very froward to frown at your francke proffer,
or very lowtishe not to listen to your lessons: for dutifully to obey, is but
the part of an obedient son, and to gainesay the institutions of so tractable
a Schoolemaister, were the part of an untoward Scholar, and a great sign
never to prove a Doctor: the one will yield me contentacion, and give me
delight, the other drown me in despair, and be a mean to cast me into the
exile of your freendly favor, then the which, no one thing can be more
hurtful to my estate, or greater against my profit and preferment: for
having lost your favor, and gained your displeasure, who will procure me a
plaster in my greatest grief, or yield me remedy for my frailty in the
multitude of my miserye: by you I hold, by you I hope: by you I enjoy that
which otherwise I had not: by you I live and lack not: by you I wish and want
not: by you my care is comfortable, which otherwise should be incommodious: by
you my health is happy, which otherwise should be dangerous. How happy is the
unfortunate child which has a careful Father? and how blessed that Son
that has a gracious Patron? but how much is Phemocles bound to the celestial
God, whose Father is as faithful as careful, and more careful then his
courtesy deserves, or are ever likely to merit. But Sir, if I miss not my
mark, and that my Card deceive me not, my vnremoouable mind in this respect
is fully resolved to prosecute your pleasure, and to spend that my troublesome
time in such honest order, and so for my profit, as may redound greatly to
your good likinge, and not a little to my preferment: pleases you therefore to
lend me that liberty, and to grant me which erst you promised, that my
tongue once attained, and my study finished, I may return as hastily, as now
I must depart speedily. I am ready so soon as it pleases you to furnish me,
and stand at your gracious command ready to depart: As touching the T'rulles
of Naples, and their trifling toys, I shall perhaps be in their Aue maria, but
I will never proceed so far as their Creed: they shall not look so lovingly,
but I will bend my brows as bitterly: they shall not talk so sweetly: but I
will answer as shrewdly: they shall not singe so pleasantly, but I will feign
as flatteringly: if they haunt me, I will hunt them: when they call quickly, I
will come as slowly, and rather I will be tied to a post, as was Ulysses, or
stop my ^ares as did his men: then be either lured with their looks, or won
with their wiles, their flattering shall not make me feign, nor their words
cause me be wanton: their looks shall not win my likinge, nor their lust get
my loyalty: their bravery shall not cause me to blaze in beastlines, nor their
paintinge to be proud in peevishness. As for their gallants the ( Neapolitane
Gentlemen) my acquaintance shall not be costly, nor my meeting stately: let them
prance it in pride upon their pounced pantaffles, I will bounce it after our
fashion with my shoes and buskins: let them bumbast their bellies, I will
retain my slashed hose: let them wear their glistering Rapiers, I will wear
my short sword: let their Ladies use the vanting of Venus, or the flattering of
Flora: the lewdenesse of Layis, or the unshamefastness of Mirrha: the
filthiness of Pasiphae, or the devilish desires of Heroydas: al their
trumperies, all their toys, all their protestations, al their prerogatives,
all their sorceries, all their sophistries, al their haggish harmony, all
their devilish melody, can not stir the mind of Phemocles to a Strumpet, nor
entice him to the treachery of a Traitor: But happily you will thus reply, or
make me this answers: Phemocles is flesh as well as others, and made of the
substance of other men: flesh indeed, but yet no morsel for such deintie
mouths, nor food fine enough for such trim trulles: they shall try me ear
they taste me, and in eating they will hardly digest me: one cause is, because I
am not powdered for their purpose, nor crammed for their chappes: the other,
that in tasting, they shall find me as bitter as gall, and in drincking a dole
drench for such doltish dotards. But alas Phemocles, thou layest on load now
the enemy is away, thou throwest down Mountains before thou came near
them: thou will kill the Devil, yet never dealtst with his damme, God grant
thou be not bewitched with their wiles, nor weand before thou have sucked: the
little Lamb skippes and leapes, till the Fox come in place, then he quiuers
and quakes, trembles and shakes, craves help so well as he can, and makes
moan after his manner: thou pratest before thou prouest, and tatlest before
thou triest: thou dreadest no danger on the dry ground, but on the Sea,
Shipwreck makes thee shiuer: the tree makes no noise before it fall, and thou
do not complain, till thou art caught: the Bear danceth before the Dogs
are on her back, and thou regardest not thy money before thou come into the
hands of Thieves: thou here in Vienna do vaunt with any, when thou art in
Naples thou will cry creake like a Cock that is crauen: in Naples the fruit
is outwardly painted, God grant it be inwardly putrified: the Damsels in Naples
are as dainty as sweet meats, but it is well if they prove so wholesome as
sower sauce: the men ruffle in their robes of purple and veluets, yet I fear
me they carry double. P. about them, and never a Pater noster, God grant thee
Phemocles to bargain with neither of both.

The good man his Father all the time of this treatise, and the saying of this
Sermon, stood listining to the lure of this trained traveler, and hearkening
diligently to that which he had spoken: and when he had ended this his
Oratorie, and declared the effect of his meaning, his Father granted for his
return, the choice to be in himself, and that gained which he went for, to
come so soon as he would: fortifying therefore himself against all the furies
of his fancy, he put on the armor of forgetfulness, and so marched under
Captain Contentus, not so well pleased as he would have wished, nor so surely
eased, as he would have desired. His father for his speedy dispatche
prepared every particular thing for so contrary a journey, and all
necessaries whatsoever for his speedy dispatche: but amongst other
extraordinaries, his friend Narbonus, had he known how, or by what means,
he would gladly have put him into his portmantue, or trussed him up in his
pocket. But, alas, this journey was so soon chopped up, and provided with such
have, as not so much leisure was left, or so much time spared, as to give a
friendly farewell, or bid adue from one to the other, which no doubt was great
grief to their galled consciences, and a heavy burden for them equally to
bear: for Narbonus was at that unfortunate time out of the Town to dispatch
some business for his Uncle, the grater his grief, the more the others
sorrow: and Phemocles when he was taking his horse, and even upon going went to
take leave of his second life, and to give the farewell to his dear freende,
but he was quite beside the cusshion, and his expectation was frustrate, which
increased his iolytie like the panges of death, and revived his spirits, as if
he should have received his last reward: for he was now on horse back, and
had taken leave of his Father, therefore to write would but breed some
suspicion in his Fathers ielous head, and to importe his message to any, he
imagined was but a device of small certainty: therefore resolved him self to
defer that determination, and stay his writing till time would better serve,
and place more fit to use his practice: he therefore departed smally satisfied,
and as ill contented.

Now is Phemocles in his wide study, as broad as the high way to Naples,
greatly troubled with the leauinge of his new faithful friend, and then the
departure from his Father troubled him somewhat: the^ was he not unmindful of
his old acquaintance, and of the residue of his kinsfolks: now he thinks
on the bravery of Naples, and then of the comely Curtizanes he should behold
there: then of their rich apparel, and so of their painted pride: now of the
vsages of their Clergy, and then of the orders of the Laicitie: now of the time
he should gain his study, which as he thought would be but half a year,
then of his return how he should be received home again? These contagious
cross cares afflicted his fancy, yet caused the way to seem somewhat shorter:
and after this his painful Pilgrimage, he arrived at Naples, the place he so
long desired, where he found the instructions of his Father to be nothing
contrary, neither was he deceived in his own imagination: for the painted
walls brought him into a great admiration at Naples: then the wrought
windows, whereout he might behold a flirting fisgig singing to her Citherne:
then the bravery of their apparel, which was so far unlike his attire: then
he marked the deuoutries of their devotion, and then their brave exercises for
recreation: almost ravished with these subtle sightes, and welnigh forgetting
the effect of his coming, yet framed he in the end his fangled fancy to
beat his brains about his business, for which he had taken so tedious
travel, and wandered such a weerie way.

Narbonus at his returning home, after the dispatch of his business, and being
enfourmed of the sudden departure of Phemocles, and his hasty voyage the
which he was gone, was stricken into such a dump, and moved so with
melancholy, as he seemed drowned from any delights, and exiled from all
pleasant conceytes: first he recorded to himself the ingratitude of his
friend, and the small regard he had to participate it unto him, that he would
seem to depart without taking leave in his own person, or not so much as
manifest it by some ragged letter: then again calling to remembrance the
obedience toward his father, and that it behooved him to do no less: than
that he was at his Unckles house to seek him, but could not hear of him, he
let fall that fancy, and entertained another in the place thereof: then his
own ill hap troubled him, for his unfortunate being out of the Town: then
this grieved him that so foolishly he had put away all his old friends, to
enterteyne him a stranger, but then thoroughly acquainted, and so soon to start
away: these perverse cogitations, so troubled him, and his own contrary
imaginations so begiled him, as he fared not so well as he might have done, nor
liked so well of the matter, but that his inward greefes appeared by his outward
shows: which his Uncle perceiving not only by his doings, but also by other
manifest signs, who loved him so dearly, and had his health in so great
honor, yet not knowing to remedy his malady, or what dre^ch to give him for
his disease, but used many sweet word^, and fair motions, to understand ye
effect of his heaviness, or ye manner of his grief: but he prevailed so much in
his purpose, and gained as much by his enquiring, as if he should have looked
for some famous act of a dead man, or heard some sweet sayings proceed forth
of the mouth of a newborn infant, which grieved him at the gall, and
displeased his patience not a little.

Not long after this new received grief, and sudden gained sickness, Henricus
was requested by a special friend, and moved by one whom he could not deny, to
help celebrat a certain feast, and to make up the mess at a banquet, which he
gladly answered to be there, and that he should command him a greater matter,
but that his Nephew, his only comfort and greatest joy was troubled with a
melancholy disease, and a fit of frowardness. Reanswered the inuitor:

Why sir I beseech you let him accompany you, and be your guest, for that ye
small company which shall be there, and they my special friends, will be
pleasantly disposed, and pass the time merrily: to ye which he willingly
agreed, and gave his full consent, on ye condition his Nephew would bear a
brain, and be merry in that pleasant passance, and place of recreation:
whereto Narbonus consented more to feed the humor of his uncle, tha^ for any
affection he had to the feast: for his stomach was yet full of his new
conceived delights, and his mind glutted with their remembrance, which feebled
his body, and altered his favor, in so much, as he looked very ill, and his
stomach was very bad. But this banquet procured ye which he never suspected,
and changed this new corsiue to an old sore: for thinking with melody to put
away melancholy, he brued a bitter bane for his own drincking, and took so
much, as he could not digest it in a long time after. The appointed day come,
and every thing provided, these invited guests all resorted, as well Henricus,
and Narbonus, as also those other which were bidden: where amongst this cumlie
crew, and courtly companions, there was a young Gentlewoman which gave Narbonus
such a glance with her eye, as she pierced a piece of his heart: and the more to
increase this new desire, and to kindle these glowing coals, he was placed so
right over against her, as he could not but cast some cou^tena^ce of favor, or
show some sign of courtesy. Thus sat he gazing first at the heavenly hue of
her beauty, then on the excellency of her bountiful bravery: then wondered he
at the greatness of her exceeding courtesy: then marvelled he at her passing
good graces: then mused he at ye specialtie of her fine behavior: then was he
rapt with ye angelical hue of her fair face: the^ was he astonished to behold
the intermixed colors of her roseal cheeks, then ye twinkling of her eyes
did so put out his small lights; as he could neither behold the^ loking on
her, yet durst he not reprove the^ for shining in such order. Thus fed he on
ye feature of her face, and could eat nothing, but lokes of love, nor drink
any thing, but ye dra^mes of his desires: sometimes when by chance she met him
with a look, or gave him a counterbuffe at ye middle meeting of their eyes, he
would blush, as if he should not so presume to look without license, or droupe
down his head, as being sorry if he had offended: then musing by what means he
might have occasion of parlea^ce, or use the means to bewray his woes,
suddenly loking that way, was not fully in the face, and still pierced farther
than at the first: for drincking too often he wanted no cups, and for always
being carved unto, no meat on his tre^cher: and amongst other that troubled
his tre^chers, Fidelia, for so was the Gentlewoman nominated, reached him the
wing of a Partrich, and laid it before him, which he so gratefully accepted,
and thankefully received, as if it had bin Manna sent from Heaven, or some of
the meat yt the Goddesses fed on: and had it bin poison coming from her
hands, or some deadly draught, she giving it, I think he would neither refuse
to eat ye one, or denied to drink ye other: for he who as yet never laid his
lips on ye law of love, nor never before felt one fit of Cupids craft, was now
limed like ye little bird, or taken in ye snare of her beuty: Thus sat Nar. as
though he had looked on ye head of Medusa, and bin turned to stone: or as if he
had always bin fainting, and never fallen: But if Nar. were ravished: Fidelia
was also betrayed, for his looks as much procured her delights, as her eyes fed
his greedy desires: for every look she repayed him a liking, and for every
sign she gave him a cross greeting: for every glance she gave him a gleeke,
and for every cast, she requited him with a conge: for every sigh, she yielded
him a blush: and for every look of love, she reanswered him a dram of
desire.

This feast ended, and the clothes taken away, thanks given to God for his
goodness, and courtesy yielded for their friendly favor, the old Gentlemen,
and most ancient company fell first to disporting themselves, and to use their
recreations, some to Chests, some to Cards, some to hear music, some to
sober talking, some questioned of their estates, some talked of strange
Countries. The younger sort used other exercises, and deused more youthlike
pastimes: some passing the day with pleasant discourses: some with propounding
queint questions: some with fine songs: some with tattling tales: some fell to
playing: and some settled themselves to dancing: amongst which company,
Narbonus made up the number, and served as one not to be spared amongst the
rest: by which means, he thought to find opportunity to talk: and time to
utter his mind to her that he served, and the seemly Saint that he held his
Candle unto: the instruments sounding, and the Music beginning to move them,
the other young Gentlemen in order took every man his mistress, and Narbonus
amongst the rest would not stand to strain courtesy, but led Fidelia by the
fair fist, who seemed not greatly unwilling, nor striued much to refuse his
ientle courtesy: the Almaine ended, and the Music ceasing to sound, Narbonus
could not restrain any longer, but spoke as follows.

Mistress Fidelia, presuming upon your courtesy, and nothing doubtful of
your friendly favor, more boldly perhaps than wisdom would I should, yet
not more earnestly than reason willed or would, moving you to take a little
pains, and to walk after your late received appetite, which may it prove to
your contentment, and be grateful to your goodness, Narbonus sufficiently
satisfied, and in mind passng well pleased: as for the courtesy of your father,
the procurer of my coming, I stand bound to do him service howsoever, or to
pleasure him after my small power.

Alas good Sir, replied Fidelia, this small pittance and little alowance which
you have here tasted, and fed perhaps a little, will suffice where there is
no better, or hold life and soul together for the time: but for any deinties,
or plenty of fine cates, if you did either expect or look for, you were
deceived of the one, and missed of the other, I the more sorrowful, and my
father the worse contented: but my fathers willing mind and great desire to
gratify his friends, is in deed to be excepted before superfluity of fare,
or choice of dishes, which seeing it has pleased you so courteously to take,
and so gratefully to except, he I am assured is sufficiently requited and
repaid with advantage: as for my courtesy it is so small, and my gratitude so
simple, neither framed after the finest, nor used any way more than ordinarily,
but that you are content to yield me more commendations than I deserve, or more
praise than I am worthy to have, which seeing it has pleased you to bestow
so bountifully, I accept them as willingly as they were meant honestly.

Then the Uialles sounded a new Measure, which forced them to stay their talk,
and to leave in the middle of their bargain, which ended, and that the other
company also talked, Narbonus spoke as follows.

Mistrisse Fidelia, to yield you ingratitude for your kindness: or
frowardnes for your freendlines: small curtesy for your great liberality, and
little thanks for your great deserts, were the part of an unmannerly mate, and
a certain show of small gentilitie, and as little honesty: for the greatness of
courtesy is not mixed with any quantity of curiosity, neither is honest
behavior to be requited with faithles fidelity, neither assured affiaunce to
be measured with so slender sinceritye: if the cause be commendable, the
qualitye cannot be but reasonable: by boul^ly vntertakinge this venterous
voyage, and coming to your Fathers house, I have gained that which I never
expected, and found that by chance, which of free will I should never looked
for, seeing that by the force of fortune, which I hope will breed my bliss,
and grant it bring not my bale, if happily I obtain it, I gain my life: if
unfortunately I loose it, I get my death: the end whereof will yield me
either everlasting happiness, or seal me a quick dispatche of my unfortunate
luckines: If Fortune be so favorable that by hap I possess it, I pass
into the earthly Paradise, amidst the greatest joys that may be: if
contrary, my willinge desires not enjoy it, I shall sink to the bottom of
despair, and so end my unhappy days.

Alas Sir, replied Fidelia, I am not a little sorrowful but greatly grieved that
your coming has been so uncomfortable, and my fathers house such a harbor
of your unhappiness, your entertainment so unprofitable, and your small
courtesy, to breed your great perplexity: your pains so prejudicial to
your profit, and your pleasure to be enterlaced with the loss of liberty: for
look by how much the more your care is increased by the means of my Fathers
homely house, by so much the more will he be discontented, to be the
occasion of your manifold miseries, or the first founder of your happlesse
infilicitie: If any thing whatsoever have been offensive or by misordringe
disliked, it shall be amended with reason, or corrected to the fashion of your
fancy: if he have hurt you unwittingly, he will heal you gladly: if harmed
you unwillingly, help you speedily: if not thankfully gratified you, yet
willingly you ought to prefer his willinge mind before his wishing desires:
for could his will been agreeable to his wish, and his wish consented to that
which he would: you had neither missed of fine fare, nor been deceived of
good entertaynmente: not so gladly have requested, but he would more willingly
have performed: not so soon have sued, as you should speedily have obtained:
not so inwardly have been moved with desire, as he would outwardly have
contented your meaning: But where there wants wealth, there of force lacks
will: and where there is will without wealth, there also is wishinge, but no
obtaininge: For my part if any way my means were unmeasurable, or my
sayings insatiable: if my dooinges were reproouable, or my dealinges
doubtful: if my delights were not dainty, or my mind any way moved then
otherwise it ought: if any fault were framed by my procuremente, or any device
done not agreeable your moved mind: I either beeinge the Author, or
yeeldinge my consent, I desire but due for my deserts, or punishment for my
offense, whosoever be Judge, or what ever be my crime: and as I am sorry that
my Fathers insecuritie has bred your infelicity, so am I not glad that my
misdemeanour has brought you to bed with the Mother of Melancholy.

Then stayed they the sounding of an other measure, and daunced about with the
other company, which ended, and the Music left sounding, Narbonus touched at
the quick, and galled near the heart, spoke these words, his patience being a
little moved.

O good Mistress Fidelia, cast me not forth to marringe, before you have
first put me to making: single not out my siftinge, before you have heard my
pleadinge: arraigne me not with rigor, before you grant me to answer for
my self: for trust me you have mistaken your mark, and shot at a wrong
Sayncte: it was your Fathers house louinge Lady, and my own self that I
blamed worthily, and entreated wilfully, neither did I quite condemn it, or
utterly dislike it, but said it would procure the one, or grant me the
other, and why then may it not yield me the best, as likely as grant me
the worst: bring as well my beatitude, as drive me my death, and gain me my
glory, as get me my grave: do you think me so far to stray out of the
bounds of honesty? or to give such judgment for my entertainment, to render
diuilishnes, for receiving such deserts, or to repay a mouth full of
maliciousnes, for gaininge my heart fraught with happiness? truly my good
Mistress, you conster wrong, and give no right interpretacion: for your
Father shall command Narbonus, who is bound by duty, and that not in matters
of mean measure, but so far as the bounds of reason will permit, or he give
willinge consent for me to put in practice: but would God grant me that
goodness, and fortune be so favorable unto me, that my willing mind might be
showed, or my simple service seen, or performing that you would command, in
pleasuringe your person, or making some show of my simplicity, I would vaunte
of my good fortune with the happiest, and boast of my blessedness with the
brauest: and in that you imagined me discourteous toward your sweet self, and
to repay your goodness with ungratefulness, I call God for my witness, and choose
him my record, that my desires were vanquished by your deserts, and your
deserts have so drowned my desires, yt without your helping hand, I must
perforce fly the field of your favor, which to do you pleasure I would
surely prosecute, though no one thing more contrary my heart: But contrariwise
all the Hagges in Hell, nor all the superiall Sprites shall ever hunt me from
your habitacion, nor frame me to follow any other felicity, but the hope of my
happiness, which is the grace of your goodness, graued in my heart, and rooted in
my interior parts: and seeing I have made so fair an assault, I will prove
to enter the breach, where I will either leave my life, or gain the goal. Be
it known therefore unto you, that not procured with better, nor moved with
worse: but even the bright beams of your virtue, and the good graces of your
personage, which to beeholde I stood amazed, and altogether for the time
senceles: when so soon as I had again recovered my spirits, and won my
forelost wits, I began first to gaze on your beauty, then to peer on your
personage: then to stare on the fine favor of your face: then to gape on your
good graces: then to marvel at your maydenly modestye: then to mu^e at your
entertainment: then to delight my self with those sweet words, which
proceeded from your dainty mouth: always intermedling my honest meaning with
your virtuous imaginacions, all which I think would ravish the hardest heart
that ever breathed, or melt the congealed mind of the greatest Tyrante that
ever lived: therefore your beauty have bestraught me, and your virtues
vanquished me: it lies in your liberty to make me the handslaue of your
sweet soul, and under your correction to grant me my freedom: which if you
wit me patiently to possess, and quietly to enjoy, I shall think all
terestriall toys, far inferior to your heavenly delights, and all earthly
pleasures but patterns of pain, to the great goodness it will importe: where
contrary, if you think me unworthy to bestow that sweet joy on, and not fit
to possess that your fair favor, I will not perforce live any longer, nor
draw my breath in this bitter bale, but yield my luckles life to the loss of
my self, and surrender my soul to thee.

And with that word, wringinge hard her hand, and casting his eyes into her
body, his wanne cheeks, with his pale lips, resembled but ye similitude of
his picture, or the counterfaite of his favor, as if before his lyuinge life
had been fled to the celestial joys, or his immortal soul had forsaken
this terestriall state: so droupinge down his heavy head, and lullinge his
unstayed body to one side, his senses were seduced into the entrails of his
sounding soul, and all his members dismembered, not having any force or
feeling: thus feebly faintinge, and falling in deed, but that he was stayed
by Fidelia, and held in her tender arms, at the view of which sight, and that
part of ye tragedy now before their faces, the other company came with helping
hands, and his Uncle ran hastily seeing him falling, for that he would
willingly have borne a part, and lent his lyuinge soul to accompanied the
late fled life, as he thought of his beloved Nephew, and Fidelia would rather
have been first in the grave, or enclosed in the body of him, rather then
stayed after the departure of Narbonus, and so left him without the company of
her self: but tempering with his pulses, and froathinge his forehead with such
distilled waters, and other devices, as there was plenty of the one, and
sufficient of the other, he recovered his spirits, and stood again upon his
stalkinge legs, lookinge round about him, and staringe on the company, at
last espied Fidelia, on whom he spente the bestowinge of a pair of eyes, and
such a glauncinge countenance, as was able to perce the armor of Achilles, no
marvel then if they ran into the heart of Fidelia.

His Uncle sorrowful to see this euente, and to play there a part
altogether unexpected, especially for his own safety: and then that he had
troubled the company, so well disposed, and so pleasauntly minded: taking
therefore his leave of the Father of Fidelia, and so of the other company,
thanked him for his courtesy, and gratified the other for their company.

Narbonus gave the adue also to them all, but especially to his beloved delight.

The assembly sorrowful to behold this cross blow, and moved to pity to see
his ill hap, giuinge judgment that this his disease proceeded of Melancholy,
or happened by the reason of his cold stomach not able to digest his fore
passed fare, or distempered with their hot drinks: others answered that
heretofore he had bin evil at ease, and kept his Chamber till that day, which
then might proceed by taking the open air, or some such like thing to be the
occasion of this inward influence, but Fidelia amongst the rest shot fairest
at the mark, and in deed hitte the very white.

Henricus walking homewardes, earnestly entreated his Nephew the cause of his
new conceived corasiue, and from whence it issued: but he must either reach
beyond the Moon, or be never the nearer his purpose: for Narbonus soothed him
up with some contrary instructions, and forced him believe that which he
fained, answeringe as contrary from the matter, as he was judged of by the
other company.

Having recovered his Unckles house, and entered his Chamber, he powered
forth these pitiful plaintes, and uttered these waywarde words to him
self, as follows.

Alas Narbonus, and is it possible that thou should so soon loose the
company of thy sweet Mistress, and so quickly forgo her sight, whom thou
preferrest before thy own life, and in whose hands but lately thou did
march so mannerly? Oh Fidelia, Fidelia, thou brookest thy name in every
respect, and wast not Christened contrary thy deserts: Alas that thy beautye
should work m^e this treachery, and thy sweet countenance procure me this
malady: my lookinge has made me mad, and my gazinge stark staring blind:
O how happy are those that do daily enjoy thy sight, and are always where
they may at the full behold thy face? was this my coming, and this my
calling of my Uncle? was this the fruitefulnesse of the feast, and the
lookinge glass of my lascivious lust? nay, was not this rather the effect of
my felicity and the manner of my fisshinge, to hap on so lovely a Lady, and
to find such a Frogge as Fidelia? But how am I deceived? and in what order
beguyled? thinkinge to enjoy her, or to catch where I never craved, or to
angle with my hook beeinge vnbayted: my Uncle procured me a little to
hastily, and willed me somewhat to speedily, to make sale of my safety,
before my former recovered maladye: but his meaning was medicinable, though
my pain prove unprofitable: by proouinge to salve my sore: he has festred my
fresh wound, and in thinking to gain me my health, has lost me my liberty.
But blamest thou thy Uncle, and reprouest him that honors thy health, and
whose welfare he wishes, who delights my desires, and craves my happiness:
who hates my misfortune, and is sorrowful to see me weep? can thou then
blame thy loving Uncle? and why not condemn the eyes of Fidelia? for had not
she looked, I had not loved: and had not she wincked, I had not woed: had not
she cast glances, I had not made semblances: and had not she infected me, I had
bin whole, where now I am sore: pleased, where now I must be plastered:
sound, where now I am wounded: and free from servitude, where now I am in
bondage. But what say thou? do thou rave, or art thou set to rail? do
thou rage, or beginnest to roar? art thou beside thy self, or does some other
speak for thee? are thy wits thy own, or have thou borrowed them of some
other? thou speak not by proof, but bablest as thou have heard thy
neighbors? did her beauty so blaze in thy eyes, that thou could not see?
nay rather did not thy own sight make thee blind? yes truly, thou can not
deny it, and if thou do, thou flatterest but thy own affections, and leadest
thy begun love, to a new lust: has her fair face made thy fortune frowning?
and her lovely lights made thee grope in darkness? has her modest means
caused thy immodest manners? and her sweet conceytes bred thy cursed cares? no
Narbonus, Fidelia is fair, so is she friendly, amorous, and amiable, pleasant,
and pitiful, loving, and loyal, modest, and maydenly, handsome, and honest,
comely, and courteous: she wants no gifts of nature, and needs no nurse for
nurture: do thou think that under so comely corpse can lodge any lust of
disloyalty? or in so beautiful a personage can remain any spark of
dishonestie? no surely, she was not framed for fashion sake, or made for that
there were no more: O how her sweet words did revive me, almost drenched in the
dyke of despair, and how her chaste countenance pierced me being almost dead:
Happy art thou Narbonus that layest thy love, where thou must leave thy loyalty
in possessing thy hope: but thrice happy shall thou be, if thou attain that
Jewel, which though thou carry not about thee, yet wearest thou it in the
bottom of thy heart: but I should not praise her before I know her, but I dare
compare her, before I am acquainted with her. Does she not in hue resemble
Hester? and in chastity Susanna? in beauty Bersaba? and in judgment Judith?
in sobriety Sara? and in wisdom Minerua? in comeliness Diana? and in
heauenlynesse Castor? But why could not thou for a time dissemble thy
danger, and keep close thy grief? but being perceived of all, they will laugh
at thee in their sleeves. Behold here the extremity of love without the
consent of lust: I crave but her seemly sight, and ask but her bare company
to comfort these my pernicious perils, and relieve these tossing torments: her
help would make me hole, and her stay would make me strong: why then should I
not enjoy her? because honestly I love her: for in loving her, I leese my
liberty, and in forgoing my liberty, I may happily gain my delight, and in
obteyning my desire, I care not the^ how speedely I gain my grave: if in dying
I yield my last breath in her bosom, who shall be more fortunate than my
self? if in living I enjoy not her company, whose death shall be more
speedily? like to the budding blossom bitten with the frost, so do I fade: or
as the Apple eaten inwardly with the worm, and never appears outwardly, till
rotting, it drop from the tree, or consumed, fall to the earth: or as the old
tree consumed, and hollow within, never appears in the wind till it fall to
the earth, or consume as it stands: so shall I fade, so shall I fall: so
shall I droupe, so shall I die: so shall I rotte, so shall I be bereaved of the
rarest Jewel that Europe breeds. Alas, are these the rewards of love? and
the recompenses of my good meaning, to hazard my life, and to die unwounded:
but do thy eyes pierce worse than arrows? and thy sight infect like the
Basalik^? If one enemy hurt another, he either seeks a present salve, or
gives him his speedy death. If a Dog be bitten by another of his kind, he
licketh himself whole again. If the fleeting fish be wounded, he heals
himself in the running River. But does not the lamenting Dear, the arrow
sticking in his side, repair to some thick groaue, or busshie lawne, where he
moorneth till he die, and walks himself, till senseless he fall dead to the
earth? Alas, is not my case such, and my wound in like order? my careful
Chamber yields me small comfort, and what reap I here, but the fruits of
infelicitie? but thou Nouice, did she give thee this gleeking gall? nay, was it
not thy own eyes? why then blamest thou her whose faith is thy felicity?
whose countenance thy comfort? whose loving looks the prolonger of thy life?
whose amiable grace the greatness of thy goodness? and whose sweet words the
very restoritie of thy mutabilitie? complain not then on her, who was not the
causer of thy malady, for had not thy own eyes bin the instruments, she had
not procured thee: and had thou not looked, thy love had bin little: and had
not thy love bin so great, thou had bin loose at liberty, where now thou art
tied to her courtesy, and bound to her beauty. And what if thou be so tied,
repentest thou thy bargain? or art thou sorry for thy choice? no, no, the
fair Rose has a sweet smell: the Uermilion violet a most pleasant sent: the
white Lilly, most amiable to behold. Do we not daily see that misshapen
things have as deformed conditions? and the brauer the beauty, the finer the
quality: the fairer the face, the more fruitful the fancy. Can there lodge
in Fidelia any mistrust? or any deceit? any dishonestie? or any envy? any
malitiousnesse? or any wickedness? not in so excellent a creature, or in so
goodly a personage, in whose feature, and in which formal body, the Creator
showed the third part of his cunning, and Nature I think envied she should
have one degree more: for had she bin celestial, as she is but terrestrial,
the heavenly Goddesses would have envied her, for excelling their favors, and
passing them in beauty: her excellency is the cause of my imperfection, and
were she not so heavenly, my desires would be but earthlye: her Angelical
face has infected my ill favored feature, and her sweet graces bewitched my
sottish senses, and in my mind, it is one of the wonders of the World, and
one of the rarest matters that may be, how she that has bin beheld of so
many, has not bin loved of all: but no doubt, her manners draw the hearts of
others, and make their maladies not unlike to mine. How could they in her
Fathers house behold her, and not love her? with what face could they look on
her favor, and not blushe at her beauty? would not her words melt in their
mouths? and her sweet sayings move their modest minds? Narbonus thou art
deceived, the Devil loves a Collier, and the Crow thincketh her own Bird
fairest. The sotte is sooner won to lust, than lured to love: the more noble
mind, the more worthy enterprise: the valiant, fears no frownings, nor the
worthy, dreads no danger. Will the Faulcon pray upon a Crow, or the
Gossehauke cease upon carrion? the Eagle on a dead Horse? or the Tassell on a
starued Dog? The Lion will devour no dead thing, nor the foul Bear touch a
man lying on the Earth. I know there are more maidens than Malkin, and more
lovers than Phillis, yet but one that likes me, or any that shall love me,
but Fidelia. But what shall I do, or what means shall I make? to whom shall
I bewail my want? or who will help me? who will relieve me? or who will
assist me? who will further me? or who will take my part? who will solicit
my suite? or who will plead for me? my case shall be manifested to my
Uncle, who will as contentedlye assiste me, as I willinge to crave help.

But thou Fool, what know thou whether he will like of thy love, or
condemn thy madness? perhaps he regards some other, and will counsel
thee to match after his mind, and to love after his liking: and if happily his
liking be so, and that contentedly, he will consent, as gladly as my self:
shall he therefore be my spokesman, and break the matter first? then will she
think he loves not my loyalty, or regards not my chastity, for then would
he not spare to speak, nor despair to speed: is not his cause best heard
that pleads himself being plaintiff? and does not he most prevail that
pitifully moves the Judge himself? yes trust me, that way is therefore the
worst, and that invention without a good device: why? the assault is already
given, and the breach is begone, yet have I not looked the enemy in the face,
or know how I shall speed: yes, I have seen him that hurt me, and scared on
the party that wounded me, yet know I not whether he will bandee or yield: if
he fight mine is the foil: if I be overcome, shall I turn home like a
coward, or be driven back like a dastard? no trust me, yet will I rather
choose a honorable death, than a reprochful life: rather a fair Hearce, tha^
a defiled body, and sooner a glorious grave, than a miserable estate: thou have
indeed begun blessedly, and thy inception not to be disliked, God grant thou
persevere as happily, and the end not to be detested: but what did thy dying in
her hand betoken, and thy fainting in such order presage? was it not a sure
sign thou should leese thy life for her sake? and seek her Soul as Aeneas
sought Dido in Hell: but she fled from him, and he never recovered her sight
again: but if her soul fly from me, and depart my sight, I will never
cease but seek her, and never leave, till I find her: thou diuinest like a
Doctor, God grant thy imagination prove thee not a Sophister: thou stand
here upon law points, and driuest doubts unlooked for, leaving the principal
to feed thy fancy: the more speedely thou speak, the more hastily thou
shall be answered: and the sooner thou do solicit thy suite, the sooner
shall thou receive judgment. Well then Narbonus, this device shall breed thy
delight, and to put this in practice, will yield thee thy contentation: let then
Paper be thy messenger and declare thy mind, and Ink thy Secretary to devise
thy meaning: so may thou manifest the inward motions of thy mind, and make
it known how dearly thou love her, which to look on thy self, thou can
not but blushe, and hold down thy head at her wise answers: In these careful
cogitacions, and amidst these sundry inventions, the day appeared in at the
little creuises, and the light brake in between the Curtains: he therefore
resolved him self to forsake his sluggish bed, and buckled on his Buskins,
where no sooner ready, and all furnished in his apparel, but he began to
write, and so to make known his secrets: yet this device seemed doubtful,
and as he imagined might breed danger, for that the conueiaunce of his
letters could not be without some suspicion, and the messenger as yet
unknown: at the last, this fancy as he imagined might breed his felicity,
and this device answer him as himself would desire, which was to requite their
courtesies who before had feasted him, and to inuit them, by whom his Uncle
was bidden, which was not so speedily of his Uncle demanded, as he with
hasty condiscending had quickly performed.

Now Gentlemen, you must imagine if Narbonus were pricked, Fidelia was also
galled: if he complained, she rejoiced not: if he languished, she laughed
not: if he were sorrowful, she was not merry: and if he complained not
without a cause, she lamented not without occasion: and if he diued in the
depth of his desire, she swam not in the sea of Security: and if his health
were denied, her life was not prolonged: You shall therefore understand that at
the departure of Narbonus and his Uncle, the one in an ecstasy, the other
amazed at the event, the rest of the company brake, and ended that days work,
which better pleased Fidelia, then if they should have stayed longer: the
assembly clean gone, and all departed, Fidelia entered her Chamber, as if she
should have gone into her Grave: where being alone, and bereft of any company,
she uttered these words.

O Fidelia, how froward is thy fate, and how unfortunate thy fall? how
lucklesse thy lotte, and how immodest thy maladye? how miserable thy estate,
and how pitiful thy complayntes? though thou werte at a Feast, yet did
thou fas^e: and in that there was plentye of Wine, yet I fear me thou haste
drank naught but thy destruction: Alas Narbonus, was thy hap so hard, and thy
chance so contrary, to catch here a corasiue incurable, and to find in
this place the fine of thy felicity: I pray it be not so badde, and wish
earnestly it be not worse: but if it be so, and no whit otherwise, who is to
be blamed, or who to be reproved? whose was the cause, or whose the
consent? whose were the deeds, or whose the dooinges? whose demeanor, or who
the occasion of so beeinge bestraught, but thy own self Fidelia, and thy own
devices? shall thy love cost his life, and thy beauty breed his bane? shall
thy brauerye cause his bannishmente, or thy eyes breed his death? shall thy
graces increase his groans, or thy countenance procure his pennaunce? no trust
me, if he loved thee a little, thou shalt love him as much: and if he lyked
thy face, thou shalt embrace his favor: does not his courtesy, exceed thy
curiosity, his behavior excel thy handsomnesse? his deserts drown thy
desires? O yes, his talk has taken me tardye, and his sweet words, pierced
my sour lips: happy art thou to gain such a freende: but thrice happy to
find such a Jewel, who is content to leave his life for thy love, and to
go into Hell to get thy freendly favor, to render the remaynder of his
life, to procure thy felicity: and shall he not then be requited for his
courtesies, and repayde for his good deserts? Yes, my health shall hold him,
and my joy relieve him: my felicity shall cause his happiness, and my goodness
requite his gratiousnesse: my life will I forgo to pleasure his person, and my
honesty of more value, then all the rest will I importe unto him, rather then
be deprived of his sight, or berefte of his company: do thou not freese for
fear? and art thou not cold to to think on thy conceytes? nay, do thou
not rather burn in desire, and art as hot as a toste: Fie Fidelia, forbear
these fond imaginacions, and forget not thy welfare to procure thy woe: but
alas, how can thou forget thy sweet freende, or put out of thy remembrance,
him whom above all other thou honor: if thou would, thou may not, and
were thy consent granted, thou can not: for if it were in thy nay, should he
have denial? no trust me, my truth shall be manifested by my trial, and my
trial shall not procure his treachery: but why did I hold him from falling,
and took him up from stumbling, when he told me my Fathers house, and hear
he had gotten his bane? Alas, because I love him should I always kiss him?
or because he is my friend, should I naught but flatter him? I hated him not,
in that I reproved him, nor disdayned him, because I consented not to to him?
could I say l^sse for my Fathers honesty, and used fewer words for my own
credit? either I must have tied up my thoughts, or trussed up my tongue: yet
my words I confess might have been more freendly, and my sayings more
satiable: my words more pleasauntly pronounced, and my doings more daintely
devised: But what amends shall I make? or what reward^ shall I render? what
ransom shall I pay? or how remunerate his demeanor? might my portion pay
the perfection? or my means any way mittigate his rigor? my desaster should
be death, and my life not enjoy my liberty, unless to lincke with him in
loyalty, and to yield him that patrimony, which al true Lovers merit: whose
lyberty is my life, whose welfare my warrant, whose happiness my gladness,
whose joy my desire.

In the middle of these her meditacions, and now in the very bowelles of
love, she was cyted to Supper, but not made partaker to such a Feast as she
was at lately before: which courteous request, more to avoid the spite of
suspicion, than for any desire of deintie meats, she dayned not to perform
his last demanding, or to give consent to ye request: but she fed more upon
fancy, than glutted her self with any cates there present: more upon dainty
devices, than any parcel of repast: for this meat forsooth was mawmish, and
this melancholy: this dish would drive her to drink, and this cause her to
dry: this was rhewmatike, and that would increase fleame: this cholerike, and
that heavy to digest: her mind was on her maydenhead, and her thoughts ran
on former preambulations: As for her heart, that had Narbonus, and as good will
he had to like it, as to leave it: to wear it, as to want it: to enjoy it, as
to be without it: her eyes tumbled and rolled now this way, then on that side:
now on this dish, then on that device: now she marked the place where Narbonus
sat, and then the spoone he eat withal: now the cup he drancke of, and then
the trencher he was carved upon: now she remembered his dancing, and then his
dalying: now his parling, and last of all his departing: her eyes ran in
every place, and she eat as much as would suffice a Sparow: she thought that
supper longest of any that ever she was at, when her dinner was four times so
long. The Table therefore taken up, and her obedience done to her father, she
departed to her Chamber, thinking to banish these toys, lying on her soft bed,
and resting her head on her comfortable pillow, but no sooner laid, but
assailed in like manner as before: then seeing no sleep would enter into her
eyes, and that perforce she must yield to her fancy, she uttered these words
following to her self, in like manner as ensues.

The toil is set to take the Dear, the hook to hang the Fish, the trappe to
begile the Mouse, the limetwigge for the Bird, and the net for ye Fox: and was
not Narbonus the^ a sufficient bait to take so simple a maid as my self? how
should I avoid it? or how should I not be taken, that have already yielded, and
never striued to make my flight? and having yielded my self prisoner, and
aba^doned my body to the enemies courtesy, no doubt but my life shall be
redeemed without ransom, and free liberty yielded at my entreating, as if thy
life were at his courtesy, and thou receyuest thy death without his loyalty.
But why denyedst thou him at the first motion, and did not grant when he
offered thee so fair? to yield at the first sight, had bin the part of a light
huswife, and yet in making denial, I fear his life be denied him: where the
Town is yielded at the first assault, there are but fainthearted Souldyours:
and had Fidelia consented at the first demanding, he might have judged me
common: that Colte that will take the bitte at the first manacing, is likely to
prove but a jade: and the Tassell reclaimed at the first lure, will prove but a
Haggard in the end: and had Fidelia condiscended at the first request, he
would surely imagined her a Strumpet: after drouping clouds, the Sun
breaks out into a blaze: after my sour sauce, he should have had sweet
sugar: the frost lasts but in the night, and in the day the thaw comes: my
heart was not so frosen, nor my mind so congealed, but had the Sun of
sufferance stayed a tide, or the heat of his desire bidden the brunt of his
bargain, but it would melt like wax, and thaw like Snow: the grass must have
a night to grow, and I one day to love: But as the ill favored Horse seems
fattest in his masters eye, so seem I most fair that do best feed his
fancy: and as the ground shows rich in the masters sight, when but barren
in the eye of another man, so does my face please his favor, although he
dislike another feature: yes doubtless, my trial is too true, and my proof
too plain, but loyalty is my life, and chastity my choice: if I leave the
one, I can not live with the other. Lucretia might have dissembled her
rauishmente, and so saved her life: had she yielded, she had not bin forced,
and had she not bin forced, she might have condiscended, and in yielding,
procured the death of him that caused the loss of her own life: but as she
yielded to lust, so did she also yield to death: she dyed, why should I live?
and had not she died, should not I therefore dye? yes surely, and dye I would,
but for doing him service, whose health will cause me to live in happiness, and
whose death will cause me to die in desperateness. Alas how I fade, how I fall,
how I look, how I lack, how I love, how I like, how I dying, faint for fear,
and how I fainting, am ready to fall: to remember his wanne face, with his
pale lips: his cold cheeks, with his staring eyes: his dying head lolling
down, and my hand held hard in his fingers, with my heart in his habitatio^,
which I could willingly consented, should have departed with his: yet durst I
not bewray my thoughts, yet durst I not cry, yet durst I not scritch, yet
durst I not complain outwardly, yet durst I lament inwardly: did I not quake,
and did not my heart droupe? yes surely, I would not have lived to his loss,
nor die to his hinderance, I think he would neither request the one, nor
desire the other: he fell like the blossom, and faded like the flower: he died
like the Daisie, and fainted like as a babe sleeps: he dyed like the
condemned, that lays his head on the block, and dies before the blow come:
but Narbonus dyed before he had his condemnation pronounced: he dyed between
thy arms, and in thy lap: When ye Rose is blowe^ to the full, it falls
from the stalk, but Narbonus died before he came to the full perfection, and
yielded before his life was in danger: But reap up thy remembrance, and pull
up thy sprights, did not these hands stay him falling? and these eyes behold
him recovering? these eyes indeed, and these hands, but from such holdings
God grant I be delivered, and from such sights defended. Could I blush to see
my own heart blood? or could I languish to see my life linger for ye grave?
could I weep to want the greatest welfare in this world? or could I lament to
behold so pitiful a tragedy? In seeing thee despair I saw my own death, and
in seeing thee breathless, I saw my own bane: in seeing thee pine, I saw my
greatest pain, and in seeing thee go to the grave, I saw my self giving up the
ghost. Could Phillis hang her self, and could not thou kill thy self? could
Andromeda dream so pitifully, and can not thou bewail thy fancy as
lamentably? could Prolixena prolong her life after the loss of her lover, and
can thou draw forth thy days, thy desires being detained? could Bacchir bath
her self in the boule of her blood, and can thou bless thy self in the
beatitude of thy bargain? was Dido content to die the death for yielding to
the deapth of her desires, and can not thou be content to sacrifice thy soul
for the satisfaction of that sweet Saint? But how did he withdraw himself out
of my danger, and how faded his face from my fancy? with heavy cheer* and
with moorning melody: with mestfull joy, and with little iolitie: though he
came in the common Cocks path, yet went he home by weeping cross: how did he
look when he badde me farewell? and what a countenance he did cast on me most
sorrowful? O those eyes, his eyes, Narbonus eyes, nay my eyes, my weeping eyes,
the eyes of Fidelia, were they not mine? yet he gave them me, but where then
are they? my heart harbors them, and I bear them in my breast. But where
art thou now Narbonus? and in what place rests thy bestraughted life? if
safe, I not sad: if merry, I glad: if helthy, the^ am I hole: if sick, I
sorry: but my divining may breed my decay, and my bewailing proc^re my woe:
for though he fainted, did he fall for me? and though he la^guished, did he
lament for me? though he soothed me sweetly, he may use me as sourely: and
though he praised me passingly, yet may he hate me heartily: though he looked
earnestly, yet may he love me slenderly, for some sullen sickness was the cause
of his sounding, and some old foistring disease did begin again to renew his
wonted course: he faynted for fear, rather tha^ feared my favor: he yt was
before sick, how could he be then sound? and he that was before infected, how
could he here be healed? why do I not then reject him, and remove him out of
my mind? his fancy shall not breed my fear, nor his favor begile my
feature: I will root out his remembrance, and burn ye bil wherewith I bid ye
bargain: his heart shall be out of my habitatio^, and my liberty not detained
with his love, let him look some other lover, and find some fitter friend:
prove some other Priest, and parley with some other Prelate: try some other
more trusty, and love some other more loyal: know some other more kind, and
serve some other more faithful: the surest will prove but sour, and the
sweetest but sauce: thou have deuined right Fidelia, and spoken but the very
truth: bid therefore thy careful bed adue, and write to him of his wanton
wiles, in seekinge to mollify so modest a maiden as my self, and to mingle
such mischief to so unfeigned a friend as Fidelia: then she left her careful
couch, and began to write as follows.

ANd could thou for my so great courtesy, requite me with a congratulatio^
of perjury: although I looked on thee, yet lusted I not after thee: and though I
daunced with thee, yet was I not bereft of my honesty: thou have wooed in
Wittenberge some wantons, wedded to thy wiles, and thou look here in Vienna
to lure me to thy lust: but alas, thou castest thy baits in a dry Ditch, and
if any bite, they will prove but Frogs: Is this one of thy School tricks?
and this thy lesson, learned so earnestly to carrye two heads in one hoode,
and two faces in one body? two tongues in one mouth, and two hearts in so
little a lump of flesh? No no, go fish amongst foolish Friars, and singe
thy Sirens songs amidst the fellowship of Flora: I would thou knew, Diana
is my Mistress, and for such cutters as thy self, they come not in our crew: I
am one of those which have vowed vestality, as for thy lyking, thou may seek
the layety of Layis: go find out some flirt to bestow thy frumpes on, and
make love to some Lozell like to thy self. O how thou would die (forsooth)
and lead Apes in Hell: thou did fainte, because I lowred: and thou would
sell thy soul, because I would not make sale of my honesty: did I hold thee by
the hand when thou dyinge saydst: and if no? and so did fall fainting. But
out (alas) Fidelia.

And with those words, the tears flowed down her face, and her head ran
round she knew not how, her senses were drowned with despair, and her soul
sanke softly to the ground: for she slept see^ely for a s^aso^, and dreamed
not of any her desires: who then had beheld her, would have thought her life
had been ^led to Limbo Lake, and her soul gone to wander amongst the infernal
ghostes: But when she returned to her former imaginacions, and had fully
possessed the freedom of her self, marualli^ge what she had done, and into
what place she had ^eene transported, began to gaze on the walls, and to
stare on every place: then she beheld her bed, and mused whither it were her
own or not: then erecting her body upon her fallen feet, and turninge to her
window, looked on other things: then seeing her glass, looked into it, where
perceiuinge her watery eyes, and her bubbles ^heekes, her hair about her face,
and her head so out of order, was ravished to know the cause, and amazed at
thi^ sight: the^ leaning on the side of her window, and turning her self to
the other part, she saw Paper scribled on, and Ink standing by it, whereat
catching hastily, she red the effect of the prescript: where seeing her own
folly, and sorrowful for that was done: she began again so lamentably to
lamente, and so bitterly to weep, as though her soul should no longer have
lived in this painful pilgrimage, and as if sh^e would at that instant forced
her self to die: then taking the paper written on, she rent every piece, and
every parcel: every word, and every letter, which her imaginacion did give
her to bewray any thing, or her fancy thought would be any way perceived: and
in this outrageous rigor, she spoke these words.

Had this writing ever been seen of any other but my self, or been red of
any but me, unfortunate wretch, the hand that wrote it should have been carved
with as many cuttes, as there were letters written: the mouth that spoke them,
should so have been rent, as never to have spoken any more: as for the head
that invented it, should never made me such inventions.

O Fidelia, whither were thy wits wandered? and into what place thy right senses
seduced? to devise so mad a mystery, and to inuente so diuelishe a device? to
preach so shameless a Sermon, and to sound such Hellish harmony to that sweet
Sain^t, whose life is my lyuinge, and without whom my careful carkas shall
prove my pe^^ry, in yielding my soul into the body of him, whom no one thing
in this world is to me so dear? Therefore, come hap, come ^eauinesse: come
sorowing: come ^olacinge: come sorrow: come felicity, come adversity: come
Hagge, come Hell: come death, come Devil: I will write to him my weeping will,
and send the effect of my meaning: let him take me, or let him turn me away:
let him love me, or let him hate me: let him accept me, or let him forsake
me: the worst that can come is but death, and I look for no less, neither
do I deserve more. What care I if death end my days, and that my life be
now at the last cast, so I may dye to serve him, whom to enjoy, I would not
fear to fetch the Goulde^ Apples from the Dragon, or to pass amidst the gulf
of Caribdes: then she took other Paper, and began to write as follows.

WHen as Narbonus thy freendly face, and louinge countenance presented the
pattern of the perfectest picture y^ Nature nourishes, or at the least ye
only form that Fidelia honors: I incensed with the light: then pawsing a
while, and reading it over again, she blotted it out and began a new.

Of all the humayne creatures that God wrought, and of all the works that he
made, man he framed after the form of his own Image, and the feature of his
own face: gave to him a soul, to live again after this terestriall travail:
and besides, lent him a thing in nature, which exceeds all others in this
world: which is the inward influence that proc^edes from the very heart: then
stayed she there, and readinge what she had written, dashed it out again,
and wrote afterward as follows.

THe pleasant Spring procures the delight of every Beast of the Feeld, and
of every foul of the ayre^ and man is renewed, as it were, and again formed:
after the cold winters blaste, and frozen fields: when the fine sweet
flowers do beautify the Forests, and deck the lawndes, every beast
reioyseth: the flickeringe birds make their musical melody: and man is
recreated, as it were, and begins again as at the first: each Bea^^
chooses his best beloved, each Bird his match: but the nature of man that
way is framed contrary for that all: Then perusing what she had written, she
blotted it clean out.

And standinge amazed, to think that she had thrice written, and neither had
pleased her, she began to renew her sorrows a fresh, beeinge uncertain what
to d^^ ^ for one way she doubted how they would be taken: and a^ other thing
troubled her, which was the secure delivery of them: in the end, resolved her
self to let them alone for that time, and to be better advised before she
wrote: which imagination took so good effect, as thereupon she went to dinner
better contented, then when she arose in the morning.

As for Narbonus, he devised first one thing, and then another: first some
ill device, and then a worse: which framed so ill, and proved so contrary, as
he looked as ill as at the first, and rather worse then likely to amend:
which his Uncle perceived at all times so ill disposed, and to have so little
appetite to his meat, spoke thus unto him.

Nephew, the Pot goes so long to the water, til it comes broken home, the Cat
plays so long with the Mowse, that at length she eats her: the Frogge
leapeth so often up the bank, that the Kite catches her: the Fly buzzeth so
long about the Candle, that she is brent to ashes: does not the Sun as well
thaw the snow, as dry the dyrt? does not ye fire as well melt the wax, as harden
the sappy wood? I fear me thou will dally so long with the fire, as you wilt
be burnt with the flame: the dawning of the day breaks out softly, increasing
till the clear light be discerned, but when the Sun shines out, what can be
hidden from the sight thereof? thy disease grows by degrees, and increases
like the waxing of the Moon, for first it troubled thee alittle, but n^w it
restreyneth thee of thy meat, whereby thou should live, and prolong thy
life. Can the Horse live without prouender? or the Lamb without the wate of
her damme? the child without the breast of the Nursse? or a man without his
natural food? can thou live, and lack the maintenance of thy life? thy
days must perforce be shortened, and thy wind wast away like the water
bubbles: and thy life lost, how shall mine be ma^nleihed? if thou enjoy not
thy desire, why should I enjoy my health? therefore Narbonus, as duty binds
thee, and as I think entirely thou do love me, put away this pens^uenesse,
and drive away these dumpes: fly from these fancies which will shorten thy
life like a shadow, and consume thee, like as the Caterpiller deuoureth the
blooming blossom: if there be any thing, whatsoever, spare for no speaking, and
thou shall not miss for obteyning: make manifest thy misery, and then if I
procure thee not a plaster, let me not bear the name of thy faithful Uncle,
that will not seek to salve thy disease.

These sweet words made so satiable a sound in the ears of Narbonus, as he
had almost bewrayed the weerie wandering of his wavering wit, but yet stayed
his tongue to some more temperate time, and to a season more fit the grafting
of his words, he thus replied.

Dear Uncle, can the Infant go so soon as he is borne? or will the Tree
sproute again so soon as the old leaves are fallen? when the Tide has
flowed to the full, must it not have a time to ebb again? and when the Moon
is waxen to the full, must she not have her season to waine again? can my
disease be dried up in one day? or can I be cured with one pleasante conceyte?
as i^ increased, so must it decrease: as it grew, so must it fade: as it came,
so must it go away again: my grief began with groans, but I hope it will
end with gladness: does not the cold increase, as Summer wears away? and
as Winter decreaseth, do not so the sprigges sproute? does not the silly
Sheep quiver and quake, deprived of his fleece? but once grown, he dreadeth
not the weather as before? the bouncing Bucke deprived of his goodly horns,
keeps the lawnes and groaues, which once grown again, he shows himself
as before. So must Narbonus comfort himself with his close Chamber, and use
his consolation in his quiet Cabin, till his malady be amended, and his
conceytes cured. But Uncle, to drive away all doubts from your desires, and
all suspicion from your presumption, I neither am infected with frenzy, nor
mad above measure: but my fever is faintness, and my pensiveness
melancholinesse: no other disease, nor any other device, no other sickness,
nor any other sainctlinesse: no other infection, nor any other consumption:
And seeing you have so courteously offered, I will as shamelessly demand:
which is, that I may enjoy the company of some pleasant disposed companyons,
and the sight of some honest merry meetings: and in that you were so friendly
invited, I beseech you as courteously to entertayne, if it shall please you
that comfortable company where you were so friendlye feasted, and so
bountifully entertained, for that they are good and honest, courteous without
curiosity, and pleasant without partiality.

To the which request, for that it seemed neither unreasonable, nor very
unprofitable, he willingly condiscended, and with speed made repair to enuite
his former banquetters, who as courteously consented, as he friendly entreated.

Now let those that have bin bitte with the Bolt of Cupid, and tasted the
conceytes of love, justify their judgments, whether these copartners fellow
lovers were incensed with their enflamed fancies, or bereaved of their right
wits, or drawn with the desire of mutual confederacy, or to make manifest
the meaning of the mind, and the other to take delight in the lips of her
lover. Fidelia for her part spared not to bounce it in the brauest manner she
could, nor looked that any one thing should be contrary her calling: no
wrinckle awrie on her kirtle, no spotte stained on her coat: every finger
she thought was fifteen, and every toe twenty: her glass was oftener gazed
in that morning, then looked on half a year before: her comely head decked
with fine flowers, and her gloves perfumed with sweet waters: As for those
things which were nearer her body, I trust lacked neither Musk, nor wanted
Ciuet, nor any sweet smelles to delight her dearling, and to feed his fancy:
As for other deinties fit for such a banquet, and other delights perteyning
to a lovely feast, she conveyed in her bosom a Casket full of kindness, the
Till filled with temperance, and the sides painted with security: the bottom
full of embracings, and both ends full of honest enticings: the hinges hanged
with harmony, and about that place delighted with melody: within the lock
stood loyalty, and hard by chastity hand in hand: on the hooks
happiness, and the inner sides lined with liberty: on the top was trust,
who held truth by the toe: on the feet was fancy, looking in the face of
fidelity: underneath was Venus sitting in the lap of poultfooted Vulcane,
and not far from thence was Diana dancing with her naked Nymphs: and a
little from them were placed Faith, Hope, and Charity: Faith was painted with
a smiling countenance, and friendly favor, looking so feruentlye upon Hope,
and so sweetly, as though ye blowing breath had proceeded forth of her
mouth, giving the one hand to Hope, and with the other hand she beckned that
Charity should come to her: Hope held a Hawk upon her fist, which seemed as
if it had bin flying away, and with the other hand she caught it again: from
one eye ran down the trickling tears, and the other looked lively, and her
countenance as though she had laughed: Charity looked full in both their
faces, and in one hand she held a Dove and a Dog, the which she presented
to Faith as her fee, and in the other hand she held a Sword and a golden
Apple, the which she gave to Hope: Hard by these was Envy, with a knife in the
one hand, and a rod in the other: then next to him was placed Disdeyne, who
stood vomiting and sla^ering out of his mouth: then was there Despair, who
fared as if he had bin running amongst the Nymphs naked: and Death following
him with a great many darts, and one of them he threw, which did stick in
the buttock of Despair: This was her Casket of conceytes, and this she carried
to prove which of them would represente her purpose, as for Rings and
Bracelets, Jewels, and Cheynes, Tablets and such like, I trust she rifled her
cofers, and left none of ye best behind her.

And if Fidelia were so ^^ne in her fancies, Narbonus was as trim in his
trumperies, and by that time he was thoroughly furnished of his attire, and
fitted of his necessaries, the long desired guestes approached: who were not so
soon come as welcome, and far better welcome was Fidelia, than either her
Father, or any other friend. Narbonus courteously saluted them all, enterteyning
them with so good grace, as showed him to be no Nouice that way, or needing any
tutor to teach him tricks: he gave to the Father of his Saint great thanks
for their late received gratulations: then saluted he the Gentlewomen orderly,
so came he to Fidelia, and kissing his hand, laid it on the fair fist of
Fidelia, and then kissed her hand: as for his eyes, he laid them under the eye
liddes of hirs, and gave her this salutation.

Mistress Fidelia, mighty Princes and great Monarchs are of duty bound, and
in conscience ought do no less then yield thanks to God for their
dignities, and praise him for their received riches: but much more I, for
inioying this benifite, and be holdinge this body, your only sweet self: to
the which all earthly thing^s are in respect but loathsome, but I prefer it
before my own life, but for suspicion, he neither durst stay to speak any
further, nor abide to hear the reply of her answer.

Henricus shortly after, placed this courteous crew in such order as he judged
best, and allotted every one their places, according to their calling.

Narbonus was content for that time to bear the office of Gentleman Sewer, and
I think could have been contented to have held a Candle at the trencher of the
Saint he served: but so soon as the first course was in, he took his place
appointed by the Master of the Feast, where he fed on a dainty dish, that
he would rather have bestowed in an other place then there: if she looked
merrily, then did he laugh: if she lowred, he frowned: if she scowled, he
was coy: if she were pleasant, then was he merry: he fed neither on spoone
meat, nor boiled dish: neither on baked, nor roasted, neither the Partridge,
nor the Plouer: neither Crane, nor Quail: neither Heathcocke, nor Mallarde:
she looked on her lust, and he beheld his life, for her lust was his love,
and his love her life: the other spent the dinner time with eating and drinking
but they with lookinge and lyking: But when the feast was finished, and the
clothes taken from the Table, after duty done, and courtesy yielded, they
arose to pass the rest of the day in pleasant pastimes, in dauncings and
dallyinges, every one was busied with talkinge, or communicating of some
matter, and Narbonus was talking with one of the Gentlewomen about common
matters, and of small importance, where after a small season and a ltile time
spent, he espied Fidelia without any to keep her company, and leaninge out at
a window: whereupon he left off with advantage, and departed where he began,
then taking Fidelia by the hand as she stood leaning, he spoke as follows.

Mistress Fidelia, to stand upon tackes of tattling, and terms of long
discourses, were but the prolonging of a painful pilgrimage, and the spending
of time without profit, now so good an occasion is offered, and that this
place will permit us a little to speak, and yet the Harbinger cries have,
have, and the messenger biddes post post: I could aleadge many circumstances,
and make many protestations, use many fair flatterings, and give many
gleeking gloses, much courtesy, and more curiosity in the working of my words,
and the placing of my parleance: know you therefore that the heavenly virtues,
with the which God has adorned you, and nature has decked you, have at the
first view of your beautiful personage, and the first sight of your fair
favor, so ravished my mind, and stolen my heart, as I who before was never
subject to any such suggestion, nor never assailed with any such malady, was
so entangled with the heavenly hue of your bright burning beauty, and so rapt
with the superexcellencie of your sweet self, as come all the torture, and
all the torments that ever were devised by any humayne motion, or invented by
any notorious Tirant, I will die the secret servant of faithful Fidelia, and
awaite on your person so long as I live: will you? will you? I will either love
you living, or follow you dead: pleases you therefore to retain so simple a
servant as my self, and to command me your slave, I shall be bound to you in
body, and honor you with my heart: And for my loialtie, if it be not
comparable to any that ever lived, and my love as much as any that ever
breathed, I pray here from the bowels of my soul, and from the inner part of
my heart, God the Judge of all secrets, and the acknowledger of all thoughts,
to pour his plagues as thick as Hayle, and his punishments as plentifully as
rain, and after the leaving of this life, all the Hagges in Hell, and all the
Feends wheresoever, with Fire to torment me, and with their Forkes always to
pursue my sinful soul. You judged, I am sure, my inward grief by my outward
sorrow, when I was at your Fathers house, and in the deapth of my dancing, and
had I then ended my days, and lost my life, I should have thought my hap
comparable to any, and inferior to none, where now if I possess not my
desires, nor obtain my felicity, my life will be more loathsome, and my death
not so acceptable: stand not therefore upon delays, neither use any lingering
excuses: pronounce either my happy felicity, or death my earthly destiny,
which if you give me, I shall as willingly. I ca^ not speak more before you
reply.

Sir Narbonus answered Fidelia: your words are precise, and very prestrict to
answer your demands at the full, and to reply in such order as you will me, I
stand amazed what to do, and yet fully you must be reanswered: you prefer my
personage (you say) before al other earthly creatures, and in doing so much, if
you perform what you say, you do but your duty, and requite but my courtesy.
You love me so well as ever wight was beloved, and honor me as the habitation
of your own soul: I will not say I love you better, nor that I honor you
more, which if you do not in every respect perform, and to the uttermost of
your power seek to mainteyne, you wish to be punished with plagues, and the
Hagges of Hell to haunt you, God guide you from them hereafter, but whilst you
are here, I hope to defend you. You are content to sacrifice your soul for my
sake, and to have your body suffer the torments of death in my behalf: the
common saying is: after you is manners: but I will be first in this respect,
then use your own as you list. My Fathers house you say was a sign sure
enough, and that I saw your love sufficiently well: O Narbonus, had thou then
dyed, or there left thy life, thy Soul should not have wandered without the
fellowship of faithful Fidelia, nor gone into the grave, without the company of
me thy most assured till death. Thou willest me not to drive off with delay,
for that tomorrow breeds sorrow: know thou therefore Narbonus, that Fidelia is
vowed thy faithful feere, and thou the only Saint that I will serve, and the
barking of fearful Cerberus in Hell, or the gaping of that Dragon of
Hesperia, shall never cause me forsake thee, or ever force me fly from thee:
the which to confirm somewhat more surely, and to bind as we are willed with
the bonds of amity, take here my hand, otherwise my heart shall seal me a
speedy pasport: therefore give me quickly my death, or yield me the thing,
without the which, I will never after this day behold the sun, or look up to
Heaven, which is thy sweet self, and no other thing.

Narbonus you imagine, or else do I quickly gave her his hand, and would I
think have died in her embracings, had not the company bin there.

O faithful Fidelia, the freendlyest that ever breathed, and the sweetest that
ever lived, how am I rapt that erst was bestraughted? and how revived, that
but now was at deaths door? am I in Heaven, or do I hold my ancient
habitation? thy life my joy, and I will not live, but to die with thee, nor
die, but to do thee service.

But Narbonus, as I have yielded thee my life, and as thou love me, use
secrecy, and hold thy hand on thy mouth, til such time as our joys may be
obtained at ye full, and our marriage rites celebrated to the depth of our
desires.

The rest of the company had spent this time in pleasant talk, and now were
set round together, where they al co^discended that every man should tell a
pleasant tale: to ye which Narbonus was enuited, and Fidelia willed to make up
the mess, who came as joyfully as they were requested earnestly, and it was
allotted a Gentleman of ye company should begin, and the other consequently to
follow, who began thus.

THere dwelt in Venice a Merchant, Marcellus del Hespado, and Madona Maria.
whose credit carried some port, and his word was worth much. This young youth
longed belike to be in love: for in every corner he was wooinge, seeking
always some one honest woman, and sometimes amongst the maidens of Flora: he
was moved too much with diverse honest men's daughters of great calling, and good
behauior, but none liked him, or pleased his fancy, but one of his own
choosing, and not of any others. Thus fed he his fancy, now with this Dame,
then with that Damsel: now louinge, then lustinge: now suing, then serving.
After this lawless life led by the space of certain months, and that he
waxed weerie of this diet, he fell in love with a manerly maiden, as he
thought, but in deed such a one as was hired for every man's silver, and set
to sale at a certain price, and long it was ere he could get grant of her
consent, or win her to his Wife, yet another man might have borrowed her good
cheap, or at the least of an easy price: she so flattered him to the will of
his fancy, and so bragged always of her honesty, which he thought to be most
true, and that he had found some singular piece: and to make him believe the
better of her honesty, and to think that she could not be but good, she would
hit him in the teeth with some one man of his profession, or some woman so
honest as her self, that had bin plagued for their wickedness, and punished for
their sins. My master Merchant thought her penny good Silver, and that
there was no better hay in Denshire, determined therefore to abide the brunt of
this bargain, and to dispatch his marriage: which ended, and that he had
certain days used her company, he suspected that which was so indeed, and
believed that which was so true as his Creed, for he perceived her tricks
and her toys: her becks and her glauncings: her paynting, and her paltring:
and though it be a matter merely mistrusted in Italy, to conference and
familiarity of a man's Wife, yet used she her former fashions that way, and
denied not to talk with any: but she had a wrong Sow by the tail, for that he
was acquainted with these caruers before: he therefore bewailed his unfortunate
wedding, and wished it had never bin done: but seeing no remedy, and that
necessity is lawless, he determined to put away his Wife, or else to put away
himself: then to put her away, or to cast her off, the discredit would be as
much to him, as now the ill name was to her: and to retain her, and not to
forsake her, every man would laugh him to scorn, and point at him in the
streets: he devised therefore this practice, and put it straight in proof,
his Lands he was content to leave with his Wife, because they were not easy to
be carried, and to sell them, would breed great suspicion, and to morgage them,
or borrow money on them, his ret^rne was uncertain: therefore so he would not
deal, but took up of his creditours to the value of three hundredth Ducats,
or near that quantity, thinkinge to see some change before the consuming of
so much coin: as for his wife he made her privy to none of his dealinges but
pretended a voyage into the Country, where he would shortly return, and four
days should be the longest he would stay: But the old Be his wives Mother,
doubted of his driftes and perceived his shifts: the night before he should
go, he pounced his Portmantue with Portigues, and stuffed it with Ducats,
laying it in his Chamber, as if there had been no such matter: his lawles
Mother, or Mother in law, when he was soundly sleepinge, (not without the
consent of his Wife) conveyed closely out of his Chamber his packet, and
brought it into her own, where she oppened it, and found that she suspected:
she therefore took out all the Portigues, and plucked out all the Ducats,
except a just hundred, which she left to sustain his want, and conuayed
therein by weight so many Counters, and in the same place where out she had the
money, and afterward laid it where ^hee found it, as if no man had seen it:
in the morninge he rose early, and took leave of his now wife, promising to
return shortly, and in deed he returned sooner then he was minded at his
goinge. Then did he secretly convey himself into a Ship, ready to sail
into Spain, who stayed but his coming, and then hoysed sails: no sooner on
ship bourd, but they wayed their Anckors, and sailed so prosperously, that
within a short time they arrived in Spain, at the appointed place of landing:
my young Master had some money lose in his pocket to pay his Boat hire, and
to serve certain days after: coming to his Inn, he delivered his carriage
to his Host, desiring him to be careful of it, for oppening it (a little)
showed, saying there are thus many Ducats, and so many Portigues: and Fortune
was so freendly, and his hap so good, as the money lay right against the
place he opened, and his Host saw nothing but Gold: then his Host took it
in his hands, and judged there was so much by the weight thereof: promised
therefore warrantise for the safety thereof, and that he would answers what ere
was therein: My young Master went into the Town as well to see, as to be
seen, making him self so merry as he might, and delighted him self so well
as he could: the charges for his diet was marvelous great, and his expenses
more then he thought they would be. One day askinge for his Casket, to reach
out some money, which delivered him, he took out above twenty Ducats,
openinge but a little hole to put in his hand, and that right against the
place where they lay: for had he put his hand on the right side, he had pulled
out Counters: and had he put his hand on the left, he had raught out
counterfeytes: but he closed it up in the sight of his Host, and his Hosts was
there present, rendering it to be kept again, which was laid where as before:
the good man of the house retained a servant, to do^ such his businesses as he
appointed him, who espying his pray, and thinking the money had been much,
pretended a voyage into Portugal, to see his old friends, and to speak with
his father before he dyed, who as he said was very old, and that long
since he had not seen him: his Master gave consent, and speedily procured
him a Pasporte, who no sooner had it, but the day following departed, and took
the Budget with him: This trauayling Traitor, and master filcher, three days
on his journey, and far enough from their getting, this Casket was missinge,
and every corner sought, and every rush removed that was suspected, or where
they thought it might be hidden: but all to late, the money was gone, and the
man was away: the good man was sorrowful beyond measure, and knew not what to
do: the day followinge, and dinner ended, his Host questioned with him of
this thing: then demanded he of some other quite contrary, and amongst other
matters, of his Casket, and the sum of money therein, who answered there were
three hundred Ducats, where out he had taken twenty: well Sir, said his Host,
more or less, whatsoever there was it is just all gone, not so much as one
piece left: whereat my young Master half dead to hear these news, and
sorrowful beyond measure, told his Host that he should answer him so much,
or else the Law should yield him nothing: his Host fearful to have this
treachery known, for that the discredit would be his, would gladly agreed to
any reasonable matter, and to some agreement though with great loss: entreated
therefore his guest to take part of the money, for the principal pa^rimony:
the other liuyinge the weight of the matter, and foreseeinge how troublesome it
would fall out, consented his Host to give him one hundred Ducats, and he to
discharge all his debts, and to make clear with the house: my young Master
by that time his diet was paid for, and the house quite discharged, had left
but fifty Ducats, much less as he imagined then he brought forth, but the
more wrong had my Host, and yet the greater his grief: This slave, servant
to his Host, and well moneyed as he imagined, arrived in Italy and landed at
Venice, where when he opened, and found but Counters, he was almost mad, and
more then half foolish, for that he had forsaken his own Country, and left
his good Master unacquainted there, and not knowing how to get into service:
but forcinge him self to do that he never thought, and puttinge that in
practice he never looked for, offered his service to many, and diverse
motions were made, but none accepted, nor no entertaynment could be had:
passinge alonge the Streates, and runninge thus up and down, he happened on
the house of Madona Maria, the good wife of my young Master: she because he
was a stranger thinkinge he should some way delight her, entertained him, and
received him into service, where he bestowed his stolen Budget in his
Chamber, the which he thought would never be seen of the right owner, nor
marked of any. The creditours of whom this money was borrowed, and where he
received his Crowns, came at the appointed day, or shortly after: Mistress
Maria with that sum her mother had taken from her husband, and with some part
of the revenues of his Lands, paid the debt, and received a bill of discharge.
Sir Marcellus del Hespado, my young master, his Crowns welnye consumed, and
his pursse very thin, saw no other shift, nor could devise any other means,
but to repair home, and that with speed: taking therefore Ship with a
Merchant of Venice that was traveling homeward, making a virtue of necessity,
questioned by the way of diverse matters, and en^^^red of the estate of Venice,
then he asked him of such a street, and for a Ge^tlewoman dwelling there,
named Maria: the other answered, he knew the Street very well, as for the
Gentlewoman, he hard that good report, and that it was most true that she was
counted a light woman, and one of a very ill name: but now so loathing that
which was reported she loved, and hating that which it was said she embraced,
there is no one in the Town better disposed, nor any that does live in better
or more honest order: and you shall understand, that being beautiful, and also
very fair, yet her conditions at that time not honest by report, nor so good
as they might have bin. One Marcellus a young Merchant of good calling, and his
credit inferior to few of his years, first liked her, and after married her:
when afterward suspecting that which was sometimes true, and imagining that it
could be no other, departed from her almost a year since, his departure
unknown to any, from which time, her life has bin so honest, and her doings
so well liked of, as she is beloved of many, and lamented of all that know
her: and were her life known to her Husband, and her doings manifested to him
by any means, he would post home with speed, and have to have her honest
company.

Marcellus at these words his ears so glowed, and he was so ravished with joy,
as he thought long till he came on shore, and desired to know the certainty
of this matter: once safely landed, and gotten into the Town, to be more
certain of that he had heard, and in no wise to be beguiled, went to an
unknown place in the Town, and where he was unacquainted: The next day
disguised him self, and wore a heard borrowed in such order, as he was not
suspected of any, nor beknowen to his wife: goinge to the house of Maria,
always in the eueninges, and when it was dark, who first enquired for her,
and soon obtained to speak with her: then making love to her, brake the
effect of his whole mind, and plied the matter very hard, but no grant of
good will could be gotten, nor any favor showen: but answered he would not
be, nor be shifted of by any means, except he obtained his desires, and
gained that, for the which he made such suite: She seeinge he would in no
reasonable matter be persuaded, nor answered with reason, disdained to speak
with him, and forbad him her house, except his pretense were less prejudicial
to her purpose, and more benificial for her honesty: but she not knowing how
to shifte him off, nor what way to leese his company, practiced that her Maid
should lie with him and use him knauishly: at his next coming, he found her
more tractable then before, and seemed to condescend upon certain conditions,
and so consented he should come that night, appointinge him ye time he should
repair: who presently departed, thinkinge all had been but lies reported to
him: he therefore procured two knaves hired of purpose, and such as were
contented to do any thing for money, thinkinge now to take a sufficient
revenge, and by this device, to put her away. At the hour appointed, and within
the time she had limited, my young Master came marching to the house, and
these Ruffians with him, who entered the house so cunningly, and conveyed them
selves so closely, as they were not perceived of any, nor known that they were
within the doors: Maria welcomed this forlorn guest, and brought him to his
Chamber, where she willed him to vnray his Robes, and go into his bed, which
done she promised to come quickly to him, but the Candle must be out whilst
she made her unready: mean while the Maid shifte into the Chamber, and went
into the bed to him: her Mistress conveyed her self into her own Chamber,
and left her maid in bed with her Master: he dallyed and embraced her a
certain space, but yet could not obtain the thing he proffered so fair
for, but was as much satisfied when he laid him down, as when he arose:
they had not been laid the space of an hour, or little more, but these
hirelings had lighted their Torches and found the way up, came into the
Chamber, and so to the side of the bed: then Marcellus leaped out of the bed,
and pulled on his beard: now Minion said he, I perceive that to be, and with
that looking full in her face, and seeing her not to be his wife, held down
his head, and had not a word to say.

Then the Maiden looked so pitifully, and began to weep, affirminge that what
she had done, was to save her Mistress honesty: I am never the more
dishonested for lying with you, neither would have been had you continued till
morninge: you may use me at your pleasure, and deal with me as you list:
but before you get my maiden head, or spoil me of my virginity, you shall
deprive me of my life, or thrust your Sword through me.

Marcellus gave these Torche bearers their hire, and rewarded them with a
little piece of money, and made them swear, never to utter this to any, nor
ever to speak more or less of it.

They departed, he shut the doors after them, and certified the Maid that
he was her Master: and for that her honesty, and because she loved her
Mistress so well, he rewarded her so bountifully, and gave her so liberally,
as she repented not the bargain, nor was sorry for that was past.

Then he willed her to take the Candle, and to go toward her Mistress
Chamber door, where she knocked softly, and made but small noise, yet awaked
her Mistress who lay for that purpose: she arisinge, and openinge the door,
espyinge him coming in, whom as she thought would have lain with her: began
to cry out, and to rail on her Maid: but he desired her to be content, and
showed her that he was Marcellus, then he craved forgiveness of her, and
desiring her to forget what was past, protestinge ever after so to content her,
and to blot out this his foolish devices, as she should not dislike of his
loyalte, nor blame his ingratitude.

She then embraced him, and willingly consented to agree to what he would have
her: all that night he never made any motion to her of his borrowed money,
neither told she him how it was discharged: her man she had sent into the
Country not far off, the day before, who made have, and posted so quickly,
that he came not home that night, nor the next day till toward the eueninge:
in the morning Marcellus rose and looked about his business, searched up and
down the house to see how orderly all things were used, and how his wife had
handled the matter, but he found every thing so well, and no one thing
otherwise then it ought, as he rejoiced that he was come home, and was
sorrowful that he stayed so long away: goinge from one place to another, and
from chamber to every corner, he espied the Budget in the chamber where his
man lay, and found that which he never had thought to known: he let it lie
still where it was, and said never a word of it, before night her man came
home, having dispatched his business: then Marcellus asked him if he had
never seen him before, or if he were not a Spaniard borne: whereto he
answered that he was borne in Spain, but he never saw him before: then
he had the Maid fetch a Budget, lyinge in such a Chamber, which brought,
he asked him if it were his, and where he had it? he answered that it was
his, and that he brought such things as he had in it: then he asked him if
he dwelt not in such a Town in Spain, and were not servant to such a man?
whereto he answered, that he was such a servant, and in such a Town: now
surely said Marcellus thou shall be hanged, for thou meritest no less: this
Budget was mine, and thou had three hundred Ducats therein, then she winge
it to his Wife, she affirmed it was so: The fellow fell on his knees,
beeseeching him of favor, and desiring mercy of him, and he would show the
effect of the matter: then his wife whisperinge in his ear, and calling him
aside, told him the whole matter, and confessed the conueying in of the
counters: the fellow thinkinge he should surely be hanged, and that there was
no remedy ^or the loss of his life: they busy in talking, and he watching
his tide, slipped out of the door, and was never seen after. This is most
true said the Gentleman, and not invented by my self, for the Gentleman is yet
living that knew both the Merchant, and had seen his Wife.

This tale contented the company a little, but would better have liked them,
had it not been so long: then Narbonus was requested to be the second man,
and that his turn came then about: whereto he made no great denial, nor
seemed very well content, but would gladly y^ some other should have spoken
for him: yet willing to do as the company would have him, he began as follows.

THere dwelt in the I Will of Rhodes, a certain Pirate, or Rouer on ye Sea, who
many years had used this kind of life, and fortune seemed always mutable in
his dooinges: for sometimes he was ritche, and sometimes pinched with poverty:
sometimes his bags filled, sometimes his Purse pennyles: sometimes he
bounced in bravery, and sometimes he marched in misery. On a time his hap
was to loose all his gooddes, and to sink his Ship, drowned many of his men,
and escaped hardly with his own life: and likely then to come to greater
penury, and to wade farther in the Sea of (...), except he provided better for
himself, and looked more earnestly to his business: bethinking ((...)) what
was best to be done, and how to deliver himself from danger, remembered he had
there a brother of great calling, and his credit very much, determined to
repair (...) him, to prove how he would pleasure him. Traveling certain
days on his voyage, and almost wierie of his life, ^ith the forow he
conceived, found (by good hap) in the way a bag of Silver: who joyful for
this good turn, and merry in mind that he spedde so well, determined not
withstanding to repair to his brother, and to spend the rest of his life with
him, never to profess the life of a ^^^er again, nor any more to delight in
such (...). Marching on his way, and mana^^ng thus his (...) stoppes, not far
now to go, and within one (...) journey of his brothers h^^se, he found a bag
of Gold, heauie^ than the first of Silver, laid down the (...) and took up
the Gold, for (said he.)

With that looking on Fidelia, he (...) staide, and could not ^tter one word
more. The company earnestly entreated him, and courte^usly requeste^ him to
(...) that was begun, and not to flee touch in the middle of the matter: but he
craved parden, and desired so earnestly til some other time, as they were
contented, and would not ask him any more: whereupon the company all rose up,
and forsaked that kind of sport, and devised some other to pass the time as
pleasantly, and to content all as quietly, for too much of one thing is
unsavory for anything, and too much pleasure is ill for profit.

Then the music sounded, and they all fell to dancing, first the old
Gentlemen, and then the ancient Gentlewomen, so the young youths, and then the
manerly maidens: every man led a Gentlewoman by the hand, and Narbonus
marched in the fist of his Mistress: always as the music ceased, the
company talked, every one told his Gentlewoman some tale: and Narbonus shriued
his Saint as follows.

Mistress Fidelia, whether this motion be Heavenly, or Angelical, (...) he by
the Gods or terrestrial? whether by the spirits internal, or by the divine
powers, I know not wh^t this love i^, neither whereof it is derived: but
surely, in my judgment, and according to my small skil^ it is so secret a
thing in nature, and proceeds in such order, as all the writers can not
sufficiently point the perfect proportion, or all the Divines atteyne to
manifest the ground thereof. I know not how the desires of other men are moved,
and so am I ignorant, whether their appetites fall out in such order as domine,
but for my part, the more I look, why the more I love: the greater fight I
gain, the greater is my desire: the more the company that is with me, the more
inwardly proceeds the motion, so as t^ all other desires, and for every other
sight, this far differs, and is quite contrary: the mutual friendship
made her (...), and the ^o^^ of parents toward their children seems quite
(...) to this, and altogether differing: Then speaking softly in her ear,
because none should hear. In my tale (said he) coming once to Gold,
esteeming that to ^e of most value in this World, and the only thing that all
men desire, looking then upon you, and beholding your fate, more precious than
all the Gold in the World in my eye, or of more estimation, than the greatest
jewel whatsoever: not able to speak one word more, or to make some end of
that which was begone, pardon me therefore I pray you, and let it not offend
you, for when you shall please hereafter to command, I will fully resolve
you, and perhaps feed your fancy with some other delighte more pleasant,
and make you merrily disposed with some toy more pretty: And for that the time
requires not now to stand upon trifling toys, and too shorten this time with
troublesome tales, for that our matters are of more importance, and our
affairs of greater weight, your council in this case must be comfortable,
and your device paid of danger, for that lingering may import disliking, and
delays breed doubt: ^oo dot (...) or experien^^ teach us, and do we not see
it our selves, that boiling lead will ^e as cold as stone: first let us
vanquish those thoughts, which other wise will breed our decays, which once
repressed, and trodden under (...), we may b^ast with victory, and triumph with

blotte out their rage, and to put their deeds in t^o ^li^ (...), he undid
himself, and move the (...) destruction. Had Romeo (...) first, and manifes^ed
the intent of his (...) done very wisely, and (...) license for the (...) of
(...) faithful friends, and if Narbonus take (...) it is time he must stay the
fall, and abide the (...) Therefore Fidelia* for the inward (...) love, and the

be uncertain of the (...), and not sure of the other, put down therefore your
mind with my determination, and what you shall think good, I shall not think
ill: what you desire, not disliked of me. Fidelia therefore, framed her self to
make him an answer, and sp^ke as follows.

Beloved Narbonus, fully to satisfye you what the substance of love is, or to
wade that way farther than I may safely come back again, my senses are
altogether unable, and my wit too wanton to make you a warrantise: but as my
skill was never schooled, and my mind unmortified, my rimes must be without
reason, and reason not so reasonable, a^ sufficient to satisfy: yet thus much
my brain can hol^ forth, and this I dare presume to say, the richest and the
greatest, the highest and the lowest, the proudest and the poorest, the
strongest and the stoutest, not only men mortal, but also Gods divine, have
bin entangle^ with love, and pric^ed with his piercing Dart. (...) under the
likeness of a Boy and such like t^ke (...) upon him, to inuest the virginity
from us simpl^ (...) ascends from the heart, and does enfl^me the mind, a
mixture in the heavenly (...), and a (...) and (...), where the favor of the
(...) and complexion of the other, is added to coequall substance (...) an
every respect (...) examples of the (...) of (...), and the (...) of ^^^oures,
we have a number to^ great to recite in a day* and more than now reason would I
should name: as Dido, Deianira, Procris, Phillis, Bacchi^, Prolixena, with
others too many for their pr^fites, and little to the pleasure of others:
whatsoever it is, or how the meaning is, let it be what it can be: you have
tasted a little, and I have tried, somewhat, as for drifts (indeed) breed but
doubts, and delays commonly bring dangers: when the Sun is set, it is too
late to call back that day again: and when the clock strikes, the hour is
passed: when death is in the dish, i^ boots not to bid him tarry: and when
the man is dead, what should the surgion do? all Trees have their times, and
all seeds their seasons: all plants their planets, and all beasts their
bearing: all Fowls their feathering, and all fishes their engendring: When the
Eagle has cast her old bill, she can not put it on again: when the Snake has
left her skin behind her, she can not creep into it again: when the Hen
has hatched her Chicke, she can not put it into the shel again: and when the
Bucke has cast his horns, he can not put them on again: every propert^^ has
his portion, and every suit his season: every fashion his action, and every
quality his cause: every profit some discommoditie, and every good motion
entangled with some ill meaning: the Sun rises, but falls not there at
night: the Moon increases and decreaseth not in one fort night: the Clouds
that rock to the East, return not presently thither again: the tide must be
taken at the full, for time tarieth not for any. Because therefore, time shall
not try us Traitors, nor prolonging shall not cause repenting: you shall
understand that I will pretend a voyage, and frame some excuse therefore, a
little into the Country, about four miles from the town: where for change of
diet, and altering my fare, where in steed of Partrich and Quayles, I shall
find Cruddes and Cream: for Pheasant and Kayles, Puddings and Pancakes: for
Capon and Swanne, Butter and Bacon: there I will stay a fortnight at the least,
but as I think more, in the which time you may cloak your craft, and coin
some excuse to make up our nuptial rites, and quickly to dispatch what ear
you shall think good: which ended, you may return when you please, and
depart as you shall see occasion: then afterward we may stay a tide, and watch
the time when we may unfold our doings, and manifest that which has passed,
and thereupon take my hand in stead of my heart, the one I can give you
outwardly, the other I can afford you but inwardly. Look to your loyalty,
and remember ye time.

And therewithal turning her from him to sincke all suspicion, and that the
dancing was ended, she went to the other company, and left him elevated to the
Skies with Moses into Heaven, or raised as Lazarus was revived from the grave:
he swamme so in the Seas of security, and bathed so in the beatitude of his
own bliss, in such order, as he knew not whether he were bestraught, or
amassed: heavenly were his cogitations, and angelical his glories: his means
were without measure, and his happiness without hardness: for now he had
atteyned ye pl^asures which in this world his soul desired, and all that he
required could not be more tha^ he had now granted him.

This courteous company having spent the best part of the day, and delighted
themselves as they desired, gave the gravity of gratulation, thanks for their
boldness, and courtesy for their kindness.

Narbonus took leave of Fidelia, and gave her the gentle Conge, he well
pleased, and she a little eased, and both better contented than erst before
they consented.

Fidelia going along with her father, and talking of common matters, remembered
him of his promise, and entreated him to perform it* of her going into the
Country: and now the day was expired, whereat he made no great denial, but gave
her his consent. Now her jewel box all this time I trust was making ready,
and her apparel peered on: now she would go with this gown, and then with
that other: now these lawnes, and then that linne^: now these ruffes, and then
those rings: now these slippers, and then those shoes: now these gloves, and
then those bongraces: every thing was too much, and yet all too little: the
least were too great, and the great not good enough. The appointed day
approached, and the desired day come, her Horses head would not be give for
washing, nor his bridle bought for biting: his mane would not be bought for
shauing, nor his tail given for clipping: her sadle set on surely, her stirrup
steadie, her clothes costly and curious, her bitte after the finest fashion,
every thing so well, and yet all not good enough.

Now is Fidelia on Horssebacke, and about to ride, as the long desired, more
curious than coy: more courteous than cumbersome, more trifling than
troublesome: every thing was amiss that liked her not, and all awrie that
pleased not her fancy: she speedely arrived at the place she rode to, and
quickly came thither, for that it was not far: her Horse trod upon thorns,
and she fate upon nettles.

Such is the furious force of hot love, such the motions of that molested
mind, whose lust is upon liking, and whose liking has gained the thing
desired: such is the inward instigation of that senseless mystery: such the
deep desire of mutual confederacy: But had Fidelia known her marriage day had
bin so far off, she would not have made such have: and had she seen before
what followed after, she would have stayed in Vienna, and not have gone into
the Country: but as there is no one thing in this world certain, so is there
not any thing but tastes of uncertainty: one man accounts such a day to be
married to a wife, and the same day is wedded to his grave: one thinks to
win the golden spurs, and gains the hempen haulter: some one man thinks
to win all the world, and leeseth his own life. After Alexanders great
Co^quests he thought to have greater, but he entered Babylon with great triumph,
and there left his life. Was not noble Anthony of Rome one day a mighty prince,
the next day forced to wander ye wods? Holofernes more desired the company of
Judith, than the conquest of his desires, and in gaining her he thought to get
what was desired, but his getting cost him his life, and if his gain were
good, he lost his head. Every one has his weal of wealth, and his time of
happiness, his field of felicity, and his golden age: but how long rests
the shadow in one place? where stays the running water? or in what place does
the su^ne stand still? always ebbing, or flowing, increasing, or decreasing,
waning or waxing. When the Apple is ripe, it falls from the tree, and when the
Rose is full blown, it falls from the stalk: when a man is at the strongest,
he waxes weaker: when the grass is at the greenest, it cha^geth colors: the
child can not be borne, before it be bredde: nor the seed grown, before it be
sown? these are the novelties of Nature, and this the fickleness of Fortune:
this the frailty of the flesh, and this the uncertainty of our happiness. As
one waxes rich, so another grows in penury: Some beggar commes to the pomp
of a Prince, some Prince to the pain of penury. Bellezarius being a mighty
Prince, yet tasted of the ticklenesse of Fortune, had both his eyes put out,
and was forced to beg in the Marketplace. Caesar but of mean parentage, and
at the first a common Soldier, afterward a mighty Prince and Emperor of the
third part of the World: this is the mutabilitie of man, and this the
happiness of our felicity, Quid certum in terris, or what under Heaven?

Narbonus now bragging in his bravery, and boasting of his bare fortune,
tiring of himself in the statelyest sort, and thinking his fortune inferior to
none, marching in the maintenance of merry melody, and rejoicing in the
greatness of his pranked pleasure, in such sort, as if he fed his own
fancy, yet he displeased his Uncle: for thinking to please his mistress, and
to delight her with daliances, he spared for no spending, nor cared for his
reckoning: he did what him liked, and lived as he lusted, he had all at
commandment, and nothing was restreyned from his custody: he kept the keys
of the cofers, and so long he lacked no lovers. He that erst was pensive and
poor, civil and honest, courteous and well disposed, is now retchlesse, and
outrageous, bouncing in bravery, and frouncing in knauerie: swearing in silk,
and sweating in satin: ruffling in roabes, and pounced with pride: ^^aunting
with a face of flattery, and vaunting in the vale of dishonestie: for which,
his Uncle was sorrowful beyond measure, and solitary without any pleasure,
uncertain what to do, or how to deal: which way to take, or by what means to
procure remedy: always doubting the worst, and evermore dissembling the best:
such is the outragiousnesse of that sickness, and such the vnmedicinablenesse
of that disease, that in procuring the favor of their Mistress, purchased the
displeasure of their God, careful to sped, and careless to get: so it be
had, what matter how? no bracelets, nor no toys: no glou^s, nor no girdles: no
garters, nor no ^carfes, are either too fair, or too fine, nothing too dear,
nor any thing of too great a price: for the brauer in sight, the better
excepted: the poorer in spirit, the less regarded: and the truer in dealinge,
the likelier to be a beggar: Narbonus cared for no cost, nor spared for any
spendinge, gaped for no gain, nor regarded any profit: all was for pleasure,
yet all beyond measure.

Fidelia was gone before into the Country, and looked long for his coming,
where she had gotten liberty for a month, and more if need required, she
still counted the days, and reconed the times, longing for her lust, and
hoping for her hap: but she was no sooner in the Country, and had remained
there a few days, but the case altered, and the wind turned South, very ill
for his shooting, and worse for his mouth: for the King of Spain had sent
Ambassadors to the Emperor, which were then returned, having obtained their
purpose, and gotten that they came for: which was for forty thousand men, which
was speedily granted, and hastily provided for: within twelve days this army
was levied, and all ready furnished: eight thousand went out of Vienna, in
which company Narbonus was one, the more his grief, the greater his Unckles
sorrow.

Narbonus imagined, because his Uncle bare such a port in the Town, and that
his credit was so great, that he should be excused, and pardoned for a little
money: but the better day, the better deed: the lustier man, the likelyer to
do his Prince service: but will he, nill he, he had received his press
money, and therefore must go, no entreating, nor no suinge: no complaining, nor
any lamenting: Gold would not excuse him, nor fee buy his freedom: here he
began to sweat, and then to swear: now to stamp, and then to stare: now to
rage, and then to rave: now to speak fair, and then to flatter: now to
dissemble his grief, and then to burst out into weeping: now to persuade him
self, and then to put some device in practice, to cause him stay at home, or
to excuse his going: then would he call him self fool, and ass, faint
hearted Lozell, and milkesop, dastard, and momarde, to be afraid of a fancy,
and run away from a shadow: But all these fancies fled away like shadows, and
new supplied their places: then meruailed he whither Fidelia would continue
faithful, or flit away false and unjust: now she would, and then she would
not: he thought he heard her say, because he was fickle, she would be as
false: then he imagined she wept, and now she complained: now she wrong
her hands, and now she throbbed: now she sobbed, and then she sighed: now
she lamented her loss, and then she sorowed her shame: now thought he to
write, and then to send: now to excuse him self, and then to condemn his
folly: but taking Ink and Paper, he began to write as follows.

AFter those ten years of toyling travail, and troublesome time, that noble
Ulysses returned with victory, and gained such conquest as he fought for: and
saylinge on the Seas homeward, amidst the waltringe Waves, to avoid that
inconvenience, when he should pass amongst the Mermaydes, he not only caused
all his men to stop their ears, but also him self he bound fast to the Maste
of the ship, to avoid their sweet songs, and not to be taken with their
inticinge harmony: his painful Penelope, and loving Wife, careful of her
honor, and favoring him before any other, devised the means to weary all
wooers, and invented a way to send them all going, so fast as they came: but no
doubt: had he not returned the sooner, she would have been wearied, but
findinge neither.

Then pausinge there, he blotted it out, for it liked him not, for he thought
with him self, and imagined thus. Should I account to stay so long? or am I
married, that she should not be wedded to any? no, no: out of sight, and out of
mind: are there no more men will she say, but the Miller? nor no more lovers
then Paris? let him go if he lust, and depart when he please: Vienna wants
no wooers then shall not Fidelia fa^le of some suitors: she is fair, the
likelier to be looked on: she is welth^, the likelier to be wedded: she his
honest, the likelier to have a husband: she is beautiful, the likelier to be
embraced: she is courteous, the likelier to be compelled: she lackes no
gifts of nature, the vnlikelier she should want a wedded feere.

But what say thou? or what do thy lips babble forth? can thou so rail
on thy beloved? or can thou rage at her that hates thee not? can thou so
rave on her that loves thy liberty, as she likes her own life? that honors
thy freedom, as she favors her felicity: that hops thy happiness, as she
hates not her own blessedness: no, no, Narbonus she loves thee, and she
will live with thee: But alas, how shall thou live with her? or how shall thou
enjoy her, whose sight thou must forgo, and whose presence thou must part
from? whose favor thou must fly, and whose company thou must be constrained
to leese indeed: and to forgo it, the greatest loss that ever lost Narbonus,
and the greatest gain that ever my self did forgo: but write I will, and
declare my mind, hap what hap may, then thus he began as follows.

THe shining Sun whose bright beams, and rhadiant rays, do bring
comfortable consolation, and great happiness to the whole earth, and to the
whole mass of mankind, who never rests to recreate us, nor never stays to
comfort us, whose night works are nothing, whose labor then avails not:
our travail then is tedious, and our labor loathsome: our pain unprofitable,
and our pleasure insatiable: After all the world has won the comfortable
enioyinge of her, and that all the day she has satisfied us as we would,
the western Mountains keep her from our sight, and deprive us of our light,
till the bright morninge when we enjoy that erste we did, and have the full
fruition as the day before, and begins her light.

Then stayinge, and looking what he had done, dashed it out again, and took
other paper, calling himself dotard, and fool: as who should say, that for
so small a time and for so little a season, I should forgo the sight of my sweet
Mistress, and then enjoy it again: and how shall I enjoy that which never was
mine? or how shall I wear that I never had? the wind turns often in a day,
and a woman's mind is remee^ed oftener in one hour: what shall I do? or what
means shall I work? my Pen disdaines to write, and my hand shakes that should
hold it: my heart is cold, and my wits are on wool geathering: my
inventions is wrong, and my wrightinge contrary: These are signs of suspicion,
and doubts of despair: imaginacions that divine some mischief, and dreams
that prognosticate my death: but yet spur up thy spirits, and wrest thy will*
marvel not on thy Memento, but think on the place whither thou must go.
Alas how I divine, and how I foresee what will follow: can I escape death when
I come there? how shall I deal to save my self? how shall I that never was
wearied with ye wars and that never tasted of those toils: that never bid
their broils, and that never saw their shot: that never hard the thundering
of their Gunnes, and never was troubled with their angry alaroms: that never
saw their bloody battayles: that never heard the skriches of those that are
slain: and shall not I walk in the fore Ward, and march in the maine
battle? shall not I be in the first fight, and be thrust out, for that I am
but a raw Soldier? how can I then escape? or how shall I fly away? there
may I sacrifice my soul for my sweet Mistress, and offer there my last
sacrifice: why? then Narbonus write thy last farewell, and never look to
speak more to her.

To his faithful Fidelia.
THe green grafte sprouting for a season fresh, and springinge for a time
fair, is by chance cut a sunder, or by some ill hap plucked up by the roots,
then burnt in the fire: or so trodden on as it never sprouteth more: if the
Grape be plucked green, or gathered before it be ripe, has neither
pleasant taste, nor makes good Wine: the Cherry hangs till it be ripe, for
who regards it before? the sweet Rose plucked before it be blown, yields
no smell, neither will the water be distilled from it: if the Fawn be let
live, he will bear a great head: and if the Calfe were not killed young, he
might in time serve for the yoke: had Sampson died in his youth, he had
never slain so many Philistines: and had Hercules been spoiled before he
came to perfection, he had never enterprised those great labors. Alas, what
shall Narbonus now in his blooming be blasted? now in his chief growinge to
be chopped down: now he is but sprouting, to wither away, and now he begins
to flourish, to be plucked up: The Drums with their dreadful noise call me,
away, away: the shrill Trumpets, with their rentinge blastes do sound, ready,
ready: my Captain has given me my press pay, and my furniture, and he
cries haste, haste: the Sailors have hoysed their Sails, and wayed their
Anckors: and they call come, come: God grant my haste be not heavy, and my
farewell fearful. O Fidelia, the best beloved this day living, and the only
maintayner of my strength: I must wander, and I must travail: I must be gone,
I must perforce depart, without thy sight, and without taking my adue: without
any imbracinge, and without one kiss: without one sweet word, and without
one freendly look: had not I consented, thou had not gone into the
Country: and had thou stayed at home, I might have found one favorable
farewell, and one sight from those heavenly eyes, which I fear me will never
behold me again, and which I doubt I have for ever lost: blame not then thy
servant sweet Mistress, but blame his hard hap: blame my froward fortune,
and reprove my unchaste chance: for had I suspected, I would have prevented
this: and in missing this chance, I might enjoyed the heavenly hap of this
life terestriall, where now I go to my death, and fear never to return
hither again: yet were it for thy sake, or to do thee any service, it should
never repent me, nor any thing trouble me: but after quiet calmes, come
sturdy storms: and after passinge pleasure, painful Pilgrimages: after
sweet imbracings, sour seperations: and after dainty daliaunces, diuelishe
pastaunces: But Fidelia, I strive against the wind, and wear my words without
perfourming of works: I swim against the Tide, and strive against the Hill:
seeinge therefore my departure is pronounced, and my lotte laid before me: my
chance is cast, and I already condemned: the Judge will not be feeed, the
Tiraunt will by no means be entreated, the Captain will not be persuaded nor
I released: no Gold nor gain, no fair words, nor wanton wiles: no
flattering filinges, nor any deceytfull dealings will warrant me my welfare,
nor pur^hace me my pardon, get me grace, nor gain me goodness: but bide upon
this bargain, and be most assured of this doubt, that what I have promise I
will perform, and what I have said, that will I stand too: and if ever Lelius
were loving, and Lepidus were loyal: if Camillus were kind: if Caephalus were
steadfast: if Titus were true: if Hanniball chose rather to dye, then to fall
into the hands of his enemies: shall not Narbonus choose ten deaths rather
then fall from Fidelia? yes, on the Sea I shall swim in thy desires, on the
land I shall walk wary, in hope to enjoy thee: had it bin the loss of my
living, or the forfaiture of my freedom: the going to decay of my goods, or
the loss of my lands: the farewell of my friends, or the forgoinge of any
other thing, whatsoever, my sorrows might have been salued, and my cares
cured: or had it been, that thou had been forced any villaynous voyage,
or compelled to any tedious travail, the^ my service might have been seen,
and my good will manifested, to have ridden or run: to have posted, to have
Lackied, to lamed my ^immes, nay to have lent my life: I should have boasted,
it well bestowed: and bragged, it benifitially bereft. But I will perforce
march in thy mellody, and fight with thy fancy: sleep with thy shadow, and
dream of thy doings: pray for thy prosperity, and wish thy welfare: trust
to thy truth, and hang on thy good hap: ^ath in thy bliss, and think yet to
enjoy that Jewel, the brightest in my fancy. But thou will happily reply, if
thou were so lavish of thy love, and so deep in thy desire: why framedst thou
not some excuse, and so might stayed at home? thou might feigned thy self
to been sick, or lame: diseased or bruised: unable for the Wars, and unfit
to fight, and rather then failed have hidden thy self away, or stayed some
where in the Country, till the Army had been dispatched, and the Camp
departed: then might thou showed thy self safely, and walked the streets
wantonly. But then, thus would I answer thee. The Sheepehearde keeps his
Cottage, and the Fisherman his little Boat: the Abbey lubber keeps his
Cloister, and the Pesaunt fears to peep out: the dastarde dares not look
on a man, and the milkesop may tarry within doors: If I were not forced, I
would not fly: and were I not compelled, I needed not complain: needs must
whom the Devil drives: and of force must he run, that is forced to fly:
But thou will say, thy departure was too speedye, and thy haste to heinous: thy
farewell to fast, and thy goinge posted more then needed: thou might come
half a days journey to see me, and bestowed three hours ridinge to taken
thy farewell: and so might I in deed, and done it easily: yet, in seeing thee
I should but renew my sorrows: and in taking my leave, have taken that grief,
which might cost me my life: like Tantalus, or like Sisiphus: like the Dragon
yt watches the goulden Apples, but dares not touch one: or like him yt saw
all the dainties in the world, and could not eat any: in seeing thee, I should
seduce my self into slavery, not sleep in security: purchase my bondage, not
possess my heritage: gain me Hell, not get me happiness: nor that thy
sight is hurtful, but my sight in seeinge thee, would procure me this
treachery: for how happy were I, might I enjoy thee? and how unfortunate is my
state, in that I forgo thee? yet time may turn all truth to trial, and alter
my affection, to gain the full perfection: the poor is often preserved by
fortune, and the ritche thrown down into the my^e of misery: when all the
blastes of bitterness are ouerblowen, and all the surges of Simony, swallowed
into oblivion, my Sun will shine in the world of my weal, and my clear day
of delight be fair in my fancy: though the Herbs be trodden, and washed
with weather, frozen with froste, and bitten with blastes, yet grow they green
as before, and look as fresh as at the first: let us then tarry a tide, and
hope for a day: The Husbandman sows his Seed, tilleth his ground, tarieth
the season and takes great toil, yet knows not who shall reap his profit,
or geather his grain: the Gardener grafteth his plants, and settteth his
Herbs, proyneth them, and weedeth them clean: sows them best for the
Sun, and bestows them out of the shadow, yet eats not one Apple him
self, nor smells to one flower. The Merchant makes a mass of money, and
prepares for his Mart, furnishes a ship, and sendes her on the Seas, yet
knows he not whyther he shall enjoy any of his Merchandise, or ever see
his fraught come home: are not our dooinges manifest, and our miseryes common,
our dangers not dayntye, and our infelicitie plenty? but hap what may come,
and let fortune do her worst, the worst is but death, and the greatest but the
loss of my life, and in dying my soul may wait on thee, and my ghost follow
thy fancy: therefore Fidelia, as you have regard of your health and as you
bear loyal love unto me, comfort your adversity with consolation, and assist
your desperate desaster with the hope of speedy return: for you may assure
your self that my gaynecome shall be as speedy as is possible, and my have
with so great desire as may be: mean while, I wish you all the joys that this
lingering life can give you, and desire all the happiness that this earthly
pilgremage can afford you.

Farewell: the secret servant of faithful Fidelia.


THis Letter sealed with sorrow, and delivered with danger, he gave to a man of
his Uncles, whose faith he credited, and whose trust in other matters before he
tried. The next day his Uncle had oc^asion to send him into the Country, and
to speed him about some business, not far from the place where she lay, nor
greatly out of the way as she should go, who glad to pleasure Narbonus, and
content to perform his request, strayned a little courtesy with his
Master, and delivered the letter.

Fidelia received the Letter, and rewarded the servant, asking if it required
answer, or if naught but the delivery? who answered, not that he knew of,
and said none that he heard of. The Servant departed better pleased, than she
was afterward contented: she therefore hasted to her Chamber expecting some
news, and posted to open it, hoping for better then she found therein: for
there was that comforted her like the pangs of death, and that written, which
delighted her like the Devils dance: but reading it, and pervsing it well, she
looked on her aperne strings, and her mind was on her maydenhead: she
construed every word, and reconstrued every letter: sometimes she laughed
though not hartelie, sometimes she wept, but that bitterly: now she imputed
hirselfe the first of this folly, and then she condemned him for a Traitor
doing her that injury: now she lamented the departure of such a friend, and
then she blamed his staying in the Town: now she confessed that he entirely
loved her, and dearly lyked her, with the greatest affection, and the most
good will, of any that loved or any that enjoyed this world: then she doubted
his loyalty was not corresponde^t to his property, nor his love so great, but
his lust was greater: for the^ would he have devised a thousand shifts to
procured his staying, and invented a number of means to have bidden at home.
Now she persuaded her fancy to find no more fault, and entreated her desires
to be content for purchasing her liberty, he would gain his own
infelicitie, and get his own death, rather than she should be frustrated of
her wish: then she wished her wavering will to let fall those fancies, and
moved her mind to banish those doubts, to comfort her self so well as she
could, and to take the matter as merry as she might: for that to say is not to
do, and to promise fair, is not to perform plenty: for he spared not for
speaking, but cared not for doing: dayned not to promise, but denied to
perform: therefore his meaning was but to wrest his wanton will, and so bid
her good night. And this last presumption, and fine imagination took such
firm root in the ground of her heart, that there it grew so long as she
lived, and there it remained, until she was buried: for she stayed still upon
these points, and had always these sayings by the end: to tarry at home is
cowardlike, and to lurk in a corner the part of a dastard: for (said she) had
his love bin so affectionate as his lust was outrageous, he would have cropen
in a bench hole, before gone in such order, and line in some dark corner,
before have gone in such manner: is it dastardlike, and the part of a momard
in gaining a little credit, and perhaps with loss of his life to leese the
purest property in this life, and to obtain the only felicity in this
world. He was no dastarde, for he durst deceive so simple a maiden as my
self, neither was he a dotard, for he could beguile me to whom he had
plighted his faith: but let him spurn at the Spanish pieces, and try them
with their trumpe^ies, as for my wool it is but weatherbeaten, yet too fine
for his wearing, or too good for his handling: are these thy sweet Cirenes
songs? are these thy painted protestations? to sell thy safety to trust a
Stranger? and to bestow thy love upon some outlandish brood? they that tried
thee, must not first trust thee, and she that enjoys thee, must wear thee
first a year about her neck: but who will wear thee that art not worthy to
be wedded? and who will wedde thee that art more wanton than wise: the Drum
sounds, and thou must be gone, the Captain calls, and thou must away: if
Vienna have never more want then to lack so lusty a Lubber as thy self, nor
never more distressed then being bereaft of so rank a Rebel, the Town will
never repent thy departure, nor wish thy welcome home. How happy is thy good
Uncle deprived of such an unthrift? and how fortunate I Fidelia in forgoing so
faithless a friend? thy Uncle may joy thy speedy posting, and I be glad of
thy happy hasting: thy Uncle is well lightened of a licentious loyterer, and
I well delivered from so false a flatterer: But happy it was that my oar was
stricken no farther in the bancke, and blessed was I that my Torch was burnte
no further: fortunate was I that my Tree was not grafted: favorable was my
felicity, that he was in my hand, but out of my heart: God grant that I
may as easily remove him, as I was willing to entertayne him: but my warrante
shall be written with water, and sealed with sauce: put into the Paper of
oblivion, and delivered with the hand of forgetfulness. And art thou indeed
gone Narbonus? then farewell faithless friend, and adue false Jason: thou
say by seeing me, thou shalt see thy death, and beholding my face, thou
shalt forgo thy own favor: then shalt thou never die by my consent, and
my countenance shall never seduce thee into thy own destruction: am I a
Basalike that my face will infecte thee? or Medusaes head, that thou will die
with looking on me? had thou yet come thy self, thou might have spedde
the better, or spoken in thy own person, thy tale the likelier to bin heard:
but Paper will not blush, and Incke does bewray, yet is not ashamed: if thou be
ashamed to take leave, I will be ashamed to entertain thee at thy return.

Here was hot love soon cold: what fair words? and what froward works?
what sweet lips? and what sour sauce? won with an Egg, and lost with an
Apple: no sooner ripe, but ready to rotte: no sooner blown, but blasted: no
sooner sprouted, but bitten with the frost: her Prayers were pitiful, her
sighs and sobbes, as though they would have pierced the hard flint: her words
wounded the heart that heard them, and her lame^ting, mollified the minds of
those that were within her hearing: here were Crocodili lothrinae, and deep
dissembling? she wh^ erst would down into Hell to pleasure his person, will
not now kneel down unto Heaven to crave one little petition* but resolved her
self never to talk with him, or to come in that place where he was present:
yet to work his mischife, or to seek some revenge, she imagined would but
crake her credit, and be a blotte to her good name, therefore she was content
to let him alone, but for ever to give him the Basalos Manos.

If Fidelia were thus bereft of reason, and almost mad with melancholy,
Henricus was as sorrowful for his Nephew, but that he hoped his safe return,
and fed his mind that he would come hastily home again: his Uncle therefore
furnishing him with money, and furniture, every thing necessary, and a man to
wait on him, betoke him to the preservation of the Gods, and to the mercy of
the waters.

Now is Narbonus on Shipboorde, and at the mercy of the waves, where his
ancient cogitations assailed him with a fresh supply, and troubled him so
bitterly, as he thought he should never see Spain, nor any part thereof: he
imagined how lamentably Fidelia would take his departure, and how sorrowful
she would be for that journey: now how she wept, and then how she wailed:
now how she sighed, and then how she sobbed: now how pitifully she would
bewail his goinge, and how happily he should be welcomed home: then thought
he, perhaps, she may be lightly disposed, and wantonly given, for she was
soon won, and easily entreated: and as quickly he may be lost, and as
soon forgone: she was easily caught, and as quickly may she be carved from
me: now I am gone out of her company, and departed from her sight: is it not
likely that she will retain some other and like of one that shall tarry at
home, more worthy perhaps then my self, and whose calling is greater th^n
mine: more worthy, nay, perhaps more wealthy: for mine she is by right, though
some other have her by rigor: and I wan her with love, though some other wed
her by law: I had her by inheritance, but some other may take possession in my
absence: But Fidelia is fair, so is she faithful: she is freendly, so is
she favorable: she is amiable, so is she loyal: she is honest, so is she
just: As she has promised, so will she perform: she gave me her hand,
why then should not I retain her heart? But thou fool that braggest before the
victory, and reioysest before the goal be thine: thou think thou have the
Apple, and have but the leaf: she soon liked of me, is she not the
likelier to love some other? did I quickly win her? and may not some other
speedily wed her? did she not quickly love me? will not some other as speedily
lust after her? and then because he loves, will she lust? and because he
wooeth, will she wed any but my self? because he burns in desire, will not
she drive him in disdain? and because he fixes his fancy in her feature,
will she therefore give grant that he shall enjoy his pleasure? no, no: under
so fair a face cannot lodge so filthy a fact: and under so true a tongue
cannot be hid pernicious poison: in so beautiful a body, cannot be any filthy
infection: and so straight a hand, must have as right a heart: For is it not
common by probability, and see we not daily the trial? that the fairer
personage, the finer conditions, and the more deformed in body, the more
defiled in deeds: Fidelia is mine, and shall not be any others, and if my body
cannot wait on her, my soul shall fulfill the uttermost of my imaginations.
Drowned amidst these contrary imaginations, and sailing in the heart of these
cogitations, now praising then dispraising: now louinge, then loathinge: now
laughinge, then lamenting: now wishinge, then waylinge: now longing for life,
then desiringe death: the boisterous winds began to blow, and the bitter
blastes troubled their totteringe Ship: the wallowinge waves tumbled about
the sides of the Boat, and the Billows beat hard on her sides, which
tottered on this side, and then tumbled that way to sea ward: wherewith
Narbonus who was never at the Sea before, nor had at any time felt the force of
the waters, grew so sick, and so troubled with the water, as he was without
hope ever to come on shore and more, and never thought to behold the fair
face of Fidelia again: where let him wallow amongst the waves, and try his
fortune with the waters.

PHemocles who had spente almost a year in Naples, and thought the time long,
profited so well as he would desire, and gained his tongue perfectly: wherefore
he wrote to his Father that his charges was great, and that time was ill spent:
now he had gained that he went for, and obtained his purpose to the full: to
which his reasonable request, and willinge demand, his Father condiscended,
and granted his return: procuring him therefore Horses, and other things
necessary: he speedily willed him to hasten his tedious travail, and to come
so quickly as he could, but willed him to take easy iourneyes by the way, and
not to toil him self with rydinge, but might if he would see the Country by
the way, and come through all the Towns that he thought any thing worthy the
remembrance there to be seen.

Phemocles after the receiuinge of his letters, and the certifiyng from his
Father, took leave of his good companions, and betook him to his Horse: where
by the way his mind was moved with many matters, and troubled with former
motions: he remembered the courteous crew that accompanied him in Naples, and
the great courtesy he received at their hands: their passing pleasures, and
their boasting in bravery: their sumptuousnes of apparel, and the lauishnes
of their Purses: their pleasant sportes, and their excellent exercises: then
their gallant Instruments, and their good music: the congregation of their
Curtizans, and the fellowship of their fair Dames: their Jewels, and their
Ringes: their Ruffes, and their Robes: their Lawnes, and their loose attires:
their nicenes in goinge, and their coins in speaking: their courteous
behavior, and their comely graces: their painted faces, and their inticinge
toys: then their protestations in their prayers, and their devout humility:
their worshippinges of their Saints, and their gilded Crosses: their
pratlinge Priests, and their costly Copes: their Crucifixes, and their Wafer
bread: their holly water stocks, and their Dirges for their dead. The
remembrance of these things were so fresh in his mind, and the company that
he always used, as he could not but divine upon them, and imploye his
cogitations that way.

Then remembered he the estate of their Weal public, and thought upon the
estate of the layitie, as their Magistrates, and their Officers: their free
men, and their Spiritualty: the severe executinge of their Laws, and the
excellent Justice used amongst them: the companyes of their fellowshippes, and
the assembly of their meetinges: their benificialitie to the Poor, and the
good orders for their mayntenaunce: nothing dislyked him, except the not
punishinge of Whoredom, and nothing he hated but the mayntenaunce of
Userers: These dislyked him in lyuinge, and in conscience he thought them
worthy of punishmente: It was lawful for to come to the house of any
Curtizan, or else to their Chambers: Their Lute they used to get the lykinge
of any man, and their Cithernes to provoke any man to their desires: If happily
he come, whom their lykinge does love, or thinkinge to gain ought by him,
they would not spare for signs, and use their eyes with winckes, and beckes,
with countenaunces, and such like wanton toies: then to frame some fine song,
and to use that instrument whose liking should be best beloved: Then came to
his remembrance his faithful friend, and best beloved Narbonus, who was the
cause of his importunate have, and the occasion he stayed no longer, minding
the first occasion of their acquaintance, and the knitting up of their
familiarity, which he hoped would in as large manner be amplified, as ever it
was before: Then he devised how to speak with him at his coming home, and
how he should entertain him, what words he should use to him, and how he
should blush at his first sight, how he should discourse of his time spent in
Naples, and how he should show to him the order of the Country: as well the
ciuilitye of their Towns, as the ordinances of their spiritualty, and
temporalty: doubtinge what should be demanded, and to what he should make
answer: then the pleasant talk that should pass between them, and their
walking in the feeldes: the assembling to their Chambers, and the exercises
they should use: sometimes he doubted of his health, and dreaded his welfare:
sorrowful to hear of any losses, and lamentinge to hear him any way perplexed,
dreadinge ever the worste, yet hopinge always the best: fearinge that any way
he should incur the ill will of his Uncle, for that old men do hate the
pleasauntnes of youth, and younglinges when their ancestors show them any
thing for their advantage, they think them to be dotardes, or old fools:
Then feared he the gayning the ill will of the Citizens, or some other his
friends and so his love should be turned to hate, and his good will to his own
disaduauntage: Then doubtinge he should some way hurt him self, by dooinge
some exercise, or any such like, which would be more grief to him, then pain
to the other: Last of all, he was sorrowful that he must bestows his
imbracinges, and use his courtesy to some other before he met with
Narbonus, that he should not be the first. This was the manner of his riding,
and this the usage of his traveling: these the inventions of his thoughts,
these the sayings of his imaginations: this the effect of the bestowing of his
love: this the thought of a faithful friend: this the certainty of his
uncertainty, and this the liking of his second meetinge.

As he was thus led in the lust of his desires, and drowned in the deapth of
their remembrance, his fathers man desirous to hear him discourse of the order
of his living, and the estate of the Country, began to boult forth these
words, and spoke as follows.

Sir, the tediousness of your toyling journey is so uncomfortable, and your
company so small, as with the one your wit is weeried, and with the other
your mind is moved, so as you can not frame your self to be merry, nor
dispose your passance to be pleasant.

Truly, replied he, the toil is tedious, and the journey nothing joyful, with
the memory of the one I can not be refreshed, nor to forget the other any
thing comforted: yet my heart is heavenly, and my mind inwardly moved with
melody, though my forces foulter outwardly, and my senses make no show of
iolitie.

Indeed, where the inward affections are framed so far unlike the outward
cogitations: where the heart harbors happiness, yet the outward senses
seduced to shamefastness, the soul sobbed with sorrows, and assailed with
sullenness: it seems very unlikely the open appeerances, or outward motions,
to import any sign of felicity, or to make show of any pleasant melody: so
secretly has nature hidden these things, and so closely conveyed them in our
thoughts: yet the outward sights souced in sadness, or the face making a show
of heaviness, the interior instigations may swim in security, or the heart
moved with delight, may flow in felicity.

Trust me, said the other, for the secretnesse of nature, my judgment is
small, and my knowledge less: but this I know, yt the heart moved with some
sorrow, ye mind can not be merry: but y^ face may seem frowardly to frown,
when ye heart is elevated to ye highest tipe of fortunate felicity.

Sir (said he) let him that is happy, not hide it, and he that is merrily
disposed not prolong his pleasure: for in hiding the one, he may hap never to
find the like again, and in not declaring the other, never come to such a
bargain whilst he lives.

Why then said Phemocles, for that it seems good to tarry no mo tides for
trial, nor to make any more days of parleance, let thy talk tend to trifling
toys, and my wit shall be as wanton to reply to foolish follies.

Then I beseech you to manifest unto me, and lay flatly before me the manners of
that Country, and the ordinances of the Neapolitane Nation, where you have
lent some little parcel of liberality, and spent some trifling time, to find
out their feate phrases, and to be acquaynted with their rules of Rhetorike:
And to begin of their fine fa^e, and delicious daynties, their bravery of
banqueting, and feasting fittest for their fancy.

To show you prestrictly the dayntines of their diet, and the finenesse of
their feedinge: their appetites are well applied to their tender stomachs, and
well bestowed to the health of their bodies. Their meat is not much, nor their
fare great, but that little that the yeate, helped with the company of fine
herbs* and pleasant Oils: with Lemmons and Pomgranats: Oringes and Olives:
as for their Wynes they want none that we have, neither have we any, but
they have so good. They eat but twice in a day, and banquet often after
supper. Their drincking not so immoderate as ours, and their quaffing not so
common. And in my mind, the order of their diet is excellent, and such as I
could very well like of.

Then replied he, trust me sir, they are greatly to be commended, and deserve
much praise: for drunckennesse with us is iested at, and gluttony is no
matter of conscience, the one infecteth ye body with diseases, ye other
drowneth the senses from all knowledge: and both (no doubt) are no salve for
the soul, but a bait for the Devil: Hell must be their inheritance, and not
think scorn to dance with his dam: But sir, for their Magistrates I beseech
you speak a little, and for the Laity, I pray you say somewhat?

The offices of their Magistrates, and duties of their Justices, is executed in
so good order, and so severely punished as I see no one thing worthy fault,
or any other that can be amended. A man may put his money to the greatest
gain, so it be priuelie, and take what interest he can get so it be not
known. Murder there is death, and Fellonies very seldom escape. Treason
executed with terrible tortures, and offending the Magistrates prestrictly
punished. The Laity deal nothing with the Spirituality, nor at any time
meddle with their matters: for the Spirituality are greatly honored, and
dutifully reverenced.

Replied the other, these vices of whoredom are great, and this sin of
Usurie is not tolerable: but let us search our own consciences, and examine
our thoughts, and we shall be found far more culpable, and much more inclined
to wicked desires. As for the Priests, they are the elect people of God, or the
graund Captains of their Master the Devil: they may lie by authority, and
steal without check, rob without rigor of the law, and commit Uenerie by
the Statute. These Caterpillars may ravish as well Maidens, as defile Widows:
they can quickly sue their dispensatio^, and speedely purchase the Popes Bull.
The Women are very great Uotaries, and devout Templers, worshippers of
superiall Saints, and honourers of the celestial powers. If married, she never
walks to Church, or goes in the streets, without the company of her husband,
or some one of her kinsme^: for y^ prince Iealousy is a great man amongst the^,
and I think naturally they are all jealous. It is a hard matter for a man to
talk with a maid, except in the Church, or at some feast, they are so dayntie
to be talked withal, and so straight laced that way, as (forsooth) they will
not be found unchaste, or counted light: yet meeting them by chance, and not
seen of any others, they may happily give you the hearing of some toy, or lend
the harkning to your talk: But my curious Curtizans knowing you to be a
stranger, and of any calling, to play under your wyndow when you are newly
laid, or the morning followyng to feed your fancy with some ^ne song, and
rather than fail passing along the streets, or as by chance you walk by their
doors, if she see you enclyned that way, or given after her will, by signs
they seek to win you their subjects, or by looks allure you to be their
lovers: but if with none of these beckes she can bow you to her bent, then
beware of her words, for otherwise she will win you to her wyles.

Then Sir, they broke their name for their courtesy, and are not curious in
that lyberalitie, and I have heard the men to be very jealous over their
wives, and very doubtful of their honesties.

If he see a man look upon his wife suspected by him, or talk with her, if
he know not the man very well, he will use him very courteously, and make an
outward show of great frindship, when he will present him some daynty^
device and closely convey in it the Letter P. which eating it, he shall never
be troubled with the wyndcollicke, nor infected with any other disease.

Truly Sir said the other, you wanted I think no companyons, nor needed any
partners, howsoever you would dispose your self, or what exercise amongst
others you would choose to use.

No truly replied he, let a man have money, and he shall not want friends:
or a good purse, and he shall lack no good companyons, protesting great
friendship, and offering great courtesy: but a man must be lauishe of his
purse, and spend francklye: speak fair, and use great curtesye: offer very
much, though a man perform but little: and they look that a Stranger should
give them place, and be care^ull how he handle his to^ng: otherwise, a man may
boult out some foolyshe word, or speak some ^ond phrase, that he may ever
after repent, and perhaps loss of his life. To dissemble is a virtue, and he
that can not lie, must not there live: he that uses one of them offends God,
but who so loves them both, the Devil will catch him.

Why then, a man must be courteous and curious, loving, though but little:
proffer fair words, what ear he profess in deeds: proud protestations, and
double doings: two faces in one hoode, and two toungs in one mouth: lie for
liberty, and dissemble to avoid danger* then his penny must be best silver,
and his groate best gold: his words most worth, though his deeds least
worthy: he crows well on his own dunghill, but in another place he will cry
creake. But Sir, I think your departure was not procured with so great have,
but your desire homeward desires as much speed: and if you like^ there well
of your companyons, yet those at home will be far better loved: for if in a
strange place a man have health, and liberty, wealth and riches, pleasure, and
pastaunce, whateuer his heart desires, and any thing that his soul wishes,
yet his own Country is more dear, and his natural friends better favored:
so as a man will choose to live poorly at home, rather than Lordlike in a
strange place.

Trust me replied the other, you have diuined like a Doctor, and hitte the
nail full on the head, shot as straight as a threede, and leuelled as with a
line: for when I was in surest safety, and no danger to be dreaded: when fear
might have fled, and no malice was meant me, yet my heart seemed heavy, and
my senses were not free from suspicion: so that for a season, after my
arrival, my boulster, the procurer of my sleep, and my bed, my only resting
place, so filled my ears with frantic fits, and beguiled so my thoughts with
vain imaginations, that my couche of sleep, was my Cabin of care, and my
means of rest, my author of disquietnesse.

Truly said the other, my mind does meditate no less, and my senses would be
seduced into those opinions: the absence is not so grievous, nor the tract of
time so intolerable, as the frail fear conceived from the sincke of
suspicion, and the troubled thoughts, which come of contrary cogitations:
which if a man once have gained some good companyons, or honest disposed
persons to accompany him, yet a man loves, but freesed in fear, and likes
but to please their fancies: these are the doubts a man conceyueth: these are
the manner of his diuinations: thus is he fearful to offend: thus is he
careful to content: thus is he always redoubling his danger, and so is he
never free from suspicion.

Replied Phemocles, many friends I gained, and many friends I found, some I
tried, and some I trusted, all were retained, but not all beloved: the best
were liked, the worst were loathed: all had fair faces, but not all hearty
graces: those which I loved, I lacked not, and those which I hated, envied me
not: for loving was my loyalty to some, and sweet were my words to all: yet
found I some as faithful as friendly, and as trusty as a man would desire,
and yet thinking on Narbonus, Vienna harbors so faithful friendship, and
that our town retains such linckes of loyalty, as Naples, though fuller of
novelties, and more fine terms uses, yet not such lasting loyalty, nor
such plenty of honesty: for Vienna in my mind has more delicious
delights, and more satiable securities: more sweet smelles of ancient
amity, and greater plenty of sure friends.

But he missed his mark, and was deceived of his sayings, for the man was
away, and that place not as he ymagined.

For that only place you have great reason, and of duty you ca^ say no less:
for there are your ancient amity, and your old Segni^urs in familiarity:
your courteous kinsmen, and your favorable father, whom to honor, and to
fear: to aid and assist: to help and to praise: to further by all the means
you may, and to set out to the uttermost of your power: you do but your duty,
and fulfill but your calling: and in doing that your duty, you depart not
unrewarded with courtesy: whose fatherly affection is so great, and whose
comfortable care so manifest, as to see you do otherwise than well, or
miscarrie by what means soever, would neither comfort his conscience, nor like
his fancy, but be as prejudicial to his person, as sorrowful to your safety.

Thus passed they their passance, and wore out the weerie way with these
pleasant discourses, and pretty posies, where after their tedious toil, they
came to their Inn, where Phemocles could neither eat meat for joy, nor
sleep in his bed for the pleasure he conceived of his travel. Thus he
swamme in security, and sailed (as he thought) in safety, but how much was he
wide? and how far from his purpose? the maine Sea was betwixt his friend and
him, and Narbonus as much distant from him, as when he was in Naples, that
painful passage, and that long cut, which was tedious in length, and
dangerous in travel.

Phemocles now at the end of his journey, and having the full view of the
Country, arrived very well at Vienna* and in good time, as he thought, hasted to
his Fathers house, and stayed not in any place till he came there, whom he
found busied about matters of his own estate, and trifling with those small
things he had to do, where after obedience yielded to his Father, and his duty
fully performed, he as joyfully welcomed him home, and as gratefully received
him, as he willingly wished, or hartelie required: who questioned with him of
diverse matters, touching the estate of the Country, and enquired by what
orders their Towns were governed, then how he had spente his time, and so,
for the atteyning of his language, wherein he found him so well profited, and
that his time so well spent, as his Father was very joyful of his time of
absence, and not a little glad of his safe return.

Afterward, they sat down to dinner, and fed on such fare as there was
provided: which ended, and the Table taken away, Phemocles thought to find out
his friend, and could not tarry longer before he spoke with him, went to the
house of his Uncle to enquire for him, and found there the house, but the man
was gone: there he enquired for Narbonus, and whether he were within? his
Uncle answered, he was neither in his house, nor yet in Germany, then he
showed him the manner of his departure, and upon what occasion.

Phemocles seemed with this tale not greatly disco^te^ted, nor deeply
displeased, but dissembled his grief, and concealed his sorrow: then repairing
to his fathers house, and coming into it, whom he found ready for supper,
and prepared to sit down: But how could he feed? or what meat could he
eat? for he had already taken that which he knew not how to put over, and
heard that with his ears, which he knew not how to digest with his heart.
Supper ended, he bade farewell to all, and gave good night to his Father, he
went to his Chamber, but not to sleep, and into his bed, but not to rest:
laid in his careful couche, and drowned in his soft bed, he poured forth
these complaints, and uttered these words.

And art thou gone indeed Narbonus? and was thy departure so speedy? must thou
vnneathes frame this unfortunate voyage in the time of my absence? and perforce
be forced when I was not present? had I bin at home, or here in thy hasty
journey, thy soul should not have wandered without my company, nor thy presence
departed without my comfort. Should not I have bin a faithful Titus in the
time of thy tedious travel? and a second Camillus to accompany thy wa^dring
wits in what place soener thy faithful fellowship should pretend passage, or
to what Country soever thy toyling travel should march forward? Alas,
could thou not have written some ragged letter, or some scribled lines? if
not written, some small sayings sent by some messenger, who might himself
manifested the memory of thy travel, and uttered y^ pretense of thy passage?
Alas, who was this the harbinger of thy heaviness, and the Pilot of thy Sea
travail? which had I known by any means, or heard by any motion, I would not
have stayed though I had lost my time, nor lingered behind to obtain this my
language: I would not tarried to have lost the good will of my friends, nor
stayed, if I had gained the ill will of my Father: whose company to me is more
curious then Coffers of coin, and more grateful then Gold: more acceptable
then Iemmes and Jewels, and more profitable then precious things or Pearls:
more pleasant then all other pleasures: and his departure then death more
bitter: But how could Narbonus write? or how could he send? what excuse could
he frame? or what device was he able to put in practice? but suspected, or
doubted: but dreaded, or mistrusted: but known by some means, or made
apparent by others: And had he sent? should I have come? or should I have lost
my learning? should I have burnt my Books, or forsaken my knowledge? should I
forgone my friends, and left my Father? And why would not he have consented,
or happily have granted my request: I might have gained his grace, or won
his willing will, I might have found such favorable freendship, and have
gained my desired wish, to have had his company, and inioyed his presence, to
laud his comfortable words, and given ear to his sweet sayings, more sweet
then Sugar, and more wholesome then Honny: more satiable then the tolerable
tongue of Tullie, and more acceptable then the vauntinge verses of Virgill: And
did not he doubt of the consent of my Father, and was fearful of his
agreement: for that old men are froward, and wayward: testy, and doting: who
think the absence of their children, for a time will breed their everlasting
farewell: and which most delights us, seems most unsavory to them: But how
could thou brook the Seas, that never tasted the sowces of the waltringe
waves? or how could thou endure the waters, that never was acquainted with
the tossinges of those sorrowful Surges: thy body may be so contrary to away
with the nature of the Seas, and thy senses so impatient with the qualities of
the Waves, as thy life may be in danger, and thy death pronounced: If so thy
life be lost, or thy soul sink into the Sands, who will there bewail thee?
or what friends will make moan? what company will follow thy Hearce, or who
will sing thy Dirges? who will bear thy Coffin, or who will dig thy Grave? who
will intombe thee, or who will wrap thee in Lead? who will write Uerses in the
praise of thy person, or will erect a Monument in honor of thy fidelity?
Alas, the cold waters must be thy Grave, and the Mermaydes must wayle and
lament: in stead of thy stately Tomb, where thou should lie whole and sound,
the fleeting Fishes, will now tear and mangle thee: where thou should have
been imbaulmed with sweet perfumes, the flowinge floods must wash and make
thee clean: I pray Narbonus that thy boon be not so bad, and wish thy hap be
not so ill: and if thou have escaped the rigor of the Rocks, and avoid the
beatinge of the Billows: is not thy danger afterward great, and thy
penance then as much pronounce? Yes, for the Spaniard is proud, so is he
stately: he is haughty, so is he arragant, hating thy health, and loathing thy
liberty: not craving thy company, and flying thy freendship: flatteringe thy
welfare, and laughinge at thy loss: contemninge thy courtesy, and peeuishly
requitinge thy painful pilgrimage: At every wry look, moved against thee,
and for every cross conceit, seeking to displeasure thee: maintaining malice,
or procuring some mischief: cockred in carnal conceyts, and dandled in
dangerous delights: always repining at thy pleasure, and ever more
vituperating thy welfare: If thou talk with him, he is as testy and froward
as may be: if thou use any conference, so contrary and cross as thou would
not imagine: if thou walk with him in the streets, or also in the Church,
thou must turn as he turns, otherwise, he will imagine thou disdaynest
him, and so shall purchase his displeasure: thou must talk to answer him
directly, though he speak never so contrary: thou to please his patience, he to
move thy humor: thou to make him merry, he to make thee weep: thou to
favor his fancy, he to offend thee frowardly: if thou seem contented, unless
to gain his gratulation, he is then offended, thinkinge thou use some
pretense to displease his person: If in familiar talk thou unwittingly wrest
out some waywarde word, or unwillingly speak which thou would not, he will
straight challenge the combat, and soon offer thee to fight: which except thou
seem as willinge to perform, as he is ready to offer, thou art no Cock of
the Game, therefore thy comb shall be cut: But if happily thou thus escape
and agree well with them, what afterward will become of thee, or how can thou
digest this coare, when thou shall be forced to march all the day in thy heavy
armor, and at night to look thy lodginge amongst the Dogs ^ There the long
grass, if fortune favor thee so well, may be thy soft feather bed, or some
straw, if thou can get any, thy quiet Couche: thy Boulster, some turfe of the
ground, and thy sheets not very fair, for that they are always at thy back:
thy coueringe cold, except thy bargayne be the better, thy Chamber not
stately, but a house for a Swine: marchinge thou shall be hindered with Hayle,
and sowced with Snow: bitten with the Froste, and nipped with blastes: frozen
in the flawes, and troubled with wind and weather: When thou shall turn thy
face up to Heaven, or look a little upward, all these droppinge on thee, and
all these runninge down thy skirtes: how happy then was thy home? and how
blessed thy Unckles House? Alas, will the remembrance of these thoughts revive
thee? nay, will they not terrify thee? then shalt thou be thrust out into
every skirmish, and evermore be the first that shall go forth: at every false
Alarm disquieted of thy rest, and at every piece discharged in the night, thou
must run to ye Trench, there must thou watch at thy Ward, and stand thy
sentinel: be one in the still watch, or walk thy Round: Then shall thou be
the first that shall fight, because thou art a raw Soldier, and the foremost
that shall enter at the Breach, because thou shall be made expert: And if by
good hap thou escape all these dangers, and be hurt with none of these
harms: that little money spente that thou cariedst with thee, and thy purse
pennylesse, then shall thou be ready to sterue with hunger, and like to faint
with thirst: and steal there thou may not, for Martial Law is straightly
executed: and beg thou can not, for none will relieve thee: for every
trifle thou shalt gain the ill will of thy Captain, and for every small
offense thy life shall be in danger, when perhaps thou shalt be better
borne then him self, and thy courage not inferior to his: Going into the
Feeld, some dastardly dotard or cowherdly sotte, shall get that by chance, and
gain by good hap, which thou with great danger of thy life, and duetifull
service shall never obtain, nor at any time be in likelihood: For, is not
this saying sooth, and the Proverb too true: The more fool, the better
fortune? For did not that carpet Knight, kill by chance that noble Achilles?
whose force to have frowned on him, the other beeinge present, or whose looks
to have lowred, he being near him, would fear the other to frame one froward
face, or caused him to used one contrary countenance: the one lasshed with his
lance, the other laid on load with his Lute: the one a notable Captain, the
other a Courtly Carpeter: ye one a little practiced by policy, the other tried
by strength: yet his hap was to give the gleeke, and the others chance to bide
the bitter bargain: So may fortune frown on thee, nay, so will it not defy
thee: Did not the carterly Ptholomy, slay cowardly y^ noble Pompey? who a
nobler Captain the^ the one, who a viler Prince then the other? Was not Caesar
the only man of his time, and stabbed in by his traiterous Senatous? who then
he a more noble Prince? who then they more Traytourlike Rebels? Yet in scaping
all these scourings, and biding all these bitter broils, in flinginge out too
far thou hap to be taken, and in ventring some thing too much, thou come
short home, who will ransom thee? or who will acquit thee? who will set thee
free? or who will fetch thee back? Answer will be made, he was foolishhardie,
and unadvised, unruled, and disdeyning to be reformed, let him therefore
either ransom himself, or try out his fortune. What shall I say? or what
shall I do? how shall I find thee out? or how shall I fetch thee home? where
shall I seek thee? or in what part of the Country shall I look for thee? I
dread the woorst, and I fear thy fall, I doubt thy danger, and I dread thy
death: how can I hope thy health, when there is no likelyhode of thy return?
the time is not now to try I fear me, nor the place to be appointed: thy life
is already allotted, and thy death determined: but honorably I wish thee come
to thy grave, and that thy death may be lamented of others: But some will
reply, the death of the field is honorable, and far better then to be
buried at home in a man's grave. The death I confess is honorable, and the
deeds comme^dable: but God give thee that honor to die at home, and to be
buried in Vienna amongst thy friends: at thy tumbling into the hole, or the
raking up of thy bones, thou may hap to get a volue of shot, or a peale of
Gunnes, which any Soldier has so much, and the greatest Captain has no
more.

Tumbling himself amidst these doubtful desires, and tossing amongst these
dreadful dangers, he le^t his slothful bed, and rose out of his sincke of
security, thinking to abandon these curious cogitations, by walking in the
Feeldes, and to drive these fond fancies into the open air: which purpose
took so good effect, as he put it straight in practice: where no sooner
entered, but his ancient remembrance, and forepassed fancies of his faithful
friend and banished exile assailed him as before, and troubled him as at the
first: for the floured feeldes were rather a help to renew his Rebellious,
than to put into oblivion his contrary conceytes: for let any man afflicted
come into any Palace of pleasure, or fine fields, furnished with fragrant
flowers, if pleasantly disposed, they augment his felicity, if pensiuely
perplexed, they increase his sorrows: he therefore that erst was pensive, can
not there boast of his bravery, and he that before was afflicted, can not
there be relieved: But now he deuiseth what means he may work to go to him,
and how to temper with his Father to get his consent: now he hops, then he
doubts: now he flattereth himself that his Father can not deny him so
reasonable a request, then he fears that he will divine upon some dreadful
dangers, the troublesome travel, in that the Country lies full of
Souldioures in every corner, and their robbing and spoiling of him: who to
pack their pouch full of read Ruddockes, or for the gain of little gold,
regard not the murdering of a man, and the selling of their Soul to the
Devil, who is their good Master, and so let him be, let them serve him so
long as they list, and the best they can, in the end they come home by weeping
Cross, and cry Peccaui: now he doubted this, and then dreaded some other
thing: now devised, and then undid it again^: now counseled, and then set it
at sale: now bid the bargain, and then drew his head out of the collar:
first feigned, then framed: first agreed, then decreede: first propounded, then
renounced: then he thought to bid the bargain, was but the part of a choice
Champion, and to give the assault, but the duty of a good Souldyours, and he
rather to ask, than the other to demand: his nay at the first was no
denial, nor his gaynesaying to stand as a bond of advantage: the worst that
could hap was but nay, and the greatest denial might in time be granted:
Then he thought to frame some excuse, and under some pretense to undertake that
voyage: then he remembered again that plain dealing was a jewel, and the
truth would be tried out in the end: Then again this troubled him, the
uncertainty of his finding, and the not knowing in what place he was: if he
should be gone from the Camp, or be thrust into garrison into some Town, his
Captain he was not acquaynted withal, neither did he know any that went in
his company: then thought he, that to make such speedy poasting would grow
to some suspicion, maruelling what his pretenced have should mean, coming so
lately home, and but then refreshed of his forepassed travel: then he thought
to stay some time, and to watch a season, for the requesting of his suite,
this was the greatest certainty, and took surest effect.

Who then had seen him in this perplexity, and so ravished in his desires,
flattering still his fancy that he should obtain his desires, and persuading
himself he could not be denied, his wits ran he knew not whither, and his
senses were seduced into sundry places: his thoughts were now in Naples, and
then in Wittenberge: now in Vienna, and then in Room: now in Germany, and
then in Spain.

Thus was Phemocles never contented, but always troubled, till he had
pouredfoorth the effect of his froward fancy, and unfolded the inward
cogitations of his doubled thoughts, thinking then he should be sufficiently
satisfied, that once obtained which he desired. Octauian after the departure
of Anthony, and his secret flying, was so incensed with outrage, and enflamed
with fury, as he could not abide to hear him named, or any man to speak of
him, but submission made, and pardon craved of his own person, when the
boisterous blastes were ouerblowen, and rigorous outrage put into oblivion, he
gained again that quiet caulme which contented him, obtained his pardon, and
gained his favor, which grew greatelye to the advantage of the common
wealth. Was not Peeter more faithful after he received pardon for his offense,
and Paul must find fault, after he left persecuting.

Phemocles now imagined to get that by entreating, which he could not gain
without asking, and to obtain that by favor, which he should never win
without friendship, watching therefore a time so convenient, as he thought none
could be more beneficial, and espying such place, as he imagined he should not
be gainesayed, he plucked up his spirits, and spoke thus to his Father.

Sir, the idle spending of time, and the wearing of a man's young years without
any profit, is no means either to get credit, or gain riches: to obtain
wisdom, or to learn knowledge: to find out experience, or to procure living:
there is nothing found but yields some profit, nor any thing gotten without
some pains. How grow the graftes? or how spring the plants? how sproute the
buddes? or how increase the floods? how commes the corn, not without tilling?
how commes the fruit, not without planting? nor profit without pain? and
that pain peeuishly employed, if it yield not some commodity. Does not the
hired servant work before he be rewarded? and the Souldioure some service
before he receive pay? Can the traveler atteyne his desires before he pass
the Seas? or the Merchant have his Ship come home before he make his mart? no
trust me: for then he returns void of his pretense, and comes home as
much the better, as when he went forth. Must not the Scholar proceed by
degrees? and the crafts man be a Prentise before he be a Master? can the
Pilot pass the Seas before he have learned his compass? and the Astronomer
give judgment of the Stars before he know the Earth? must not the Shomaker
make a latchet before he fashion a boot? and the Paynter use his pen before he
practice with his pensell? could I atteyned my tongue if I had stayed at home?
and how should he be learned that never looks on Books? the minority of
small things must first be learned, then the substance of greater matters the
easier to be atteyned. The Gretians sacked Troy, but not without great toil:
and the Romans won Jerusalem, but not without great travel. Caesar gained
the Empire, but not without long labor: and the Turks won the Rhodes, but
not without great slaughter. Tully gained eloquence, but not without great
study: and Orpheus got his wife out of Hell, but not without passing toil.
Of somewhat comes something, but of idleness nothing ensues. Does not the
Astronomer stare long on the Stars, before he make his Prognostication: and
the Lawyer pleades not at the Bar, before he know his cases: can the
Musition attain the ground of music by one Instrument? and could Pithagoras
attain his wisdom in one day? but once gained, what profit does import? and
once attained, what credit insueth? Thus pain will yield profit, and
tedious travail bring greedy gain: to linger at home, and to loyter in the
Town: To keep as well ill disposed company, as those which are honest and
good, I know is an offense to God, and some grudge to my conscience: the way to
grow into discredit, and the means to moon m^e to naughtiness: Wherefore
were we made, or wherefore begotten? wherefore created after the Images of God?
or wherefore did he breath life into us? to stand like Ciphers, or to be
deuouring^ Catterpillers? no, every one after his degree, and each according
to his calling: If it shall please you therefore to think good of it, and that
it be not disagreeable to your mind, to grant this my small request, and not
to gainsay that which I shall crave: for as you have found me always obedient
to perform what ever you should command: so wish I not longer to live, then
duetifully to obey your pleasure: which is, that I may find so much favor in
your sight, and obtain so much goodness at your hands, to maintain a voyage
into Spain, to see that noble Country: troublesome I know it will seem unto
you, and a thing altogether unexpected: but for my time of absence, and the
while I shall be away, grant how long it please* or how little shall like you
best, if it be but one quarter of a year, or less, if sooner I may make my
return: for my charges, my bare diet shall excuse me: and for expenses, Horse
hire will be the greatest: and my journey I hope will not be so chargeable,
but my return will be as profitable: lyuinge thus, I consume my years, and
profit not my wit: which well employed, would profit my self, and further
some other: Is not the Be ^yued for her Honny, and the Sheep sheared for her
fleece? is not the Foul plucked for her feathers, and the Ox his neck
wrought for his Masters profit? Is not the Tree grafted to yield fruit, and
the ground labored to bring forth Corn? Wherefore was I begotten? or to what
end had you such care over me in my infancy? wherefore was I fostered, and
wherefore nourished to this age? to be a Droane amongst the Bees, and a
Catterpiller amongst the Fruit, devouring the profit of others, and seruinge
to no use my self: But happily, you will demand the cause of my hasty
voyage, and the occasion of my sudden departure, which though it seem hasty
to you, yet it has been long since put in practice by me: you know better
then I can manifest unto you, and saw more by experience, then I have by
hearesay: The late Army levied by our Noble Emperor, and the Royal company
that issued forth of our Town: the number of Horsemen, glisteringe in their
bright Armor, and the brave company of Footmen, with their Pikes and Shot:
the courageous Captains in their callinges, and the lustye Sergeauntes in
their Offices: All which, as it will yield no great discommodity to you, so
must it of necessity be very profitable for me: then may I boast, I have
seen an Army Royal: then may I vaunt of that noble Country of Spain: I
would not you should think my meaning is to serve, or to take pay as a
Soldier: for that my cunning is small, and my experience less: only my
desire is to gain the full sight of that huge Army, and to see their noble
orders, and Ordinances: As for my time of absence, and the space to be away:
I refer it to your discretion, and shall contentedly be ruled by your will.

His Father who suspected that pretense lea^^ of any in the world, and never
imagined any such demand would be required: knew not how to answer at the
(...), nor how to deny so reasonable a request: yet both fearful of his
danger, and careful of his health: doubtinge ^^ well the danger of the
fominge floods, as mistrustinge the health of his Son, who was never on the
Sea before, nor at any time in little danger of drowning: then feared he the
nature of the Country would not agree with him: and then doubted he the
disposition of the people, which was altogether unlike theirs: yet in the end
imagininge that he would have sufficient regard of his own safety, and look
diligently to the health of him self, he therefore put away all doubts, and
shaped him this answer.

MY beloved Phemocles, what the heart thinks, the mouth utters: and what
the mind inwardly conceyueth, is known partly by the outward cogitations:
there is no commodity, but has his discommodity: an^ no profit, but has some
disprofite: thou art not borne to eat always thy bread in one place, nor bred
to drink always of one Well: The cloth has his list, and the Tree not
without some blast: the Nutte his shell, and the sweet Be, her stinginge
tail: as the one cannot be made without the other, so must the best be a
helper to the worser. I thy Father, never trauayled out of my Country: thou my
Son have trauayled, and desire more: I a great Marchaunte, thou ignoraunte
of the Mart: thou desire that I never wished, and crauest that, which were
it in my case, should never be desired: Aristippus says we are borne for
pleasure, but Cato says we are begotten for the utility of our Country: we
are borne in deed for the pleasure of GOD, and created to do the will of our
heavenly Father.

Anaxagoras says, we are borne to look up to Heaven, and Naso wills us to
pleasure all men: And as the aforesaid Anaxagoras says in that respect we
are Angel like, and do resemble the doings of our ma^^r, in that all other
Creatures do look downewarde, and have no regard to behold the Heavens: and
man is the only thing in this world, that other beasts do fear, and they
tremble to behold his countenance: but let that pass, and come to the
purpose: Thou desire the life of a Trauailer, and imployest thy mind that
way, which to thy profit to make denial, and to thy utility not to
perform, were but the part of an discourteous Father, and the deeds of an
ill disposed parente. There is no reason I should disdain thy doings being
good, and no cause why I should blame thy bargains being honest. One
desires the life of a Souldyoure, another requires the life of a Merchante:
One seeks the life and liberty of a free man, another regards to live in
foreign Countries: one delights to travel by Sea, another more rejoices
to journey by Land.

Fabritius greatest joy was by poverty, and that only life he desired: for,
he that had nothing, was certain not to leese any thing.

Rutilius rejoiced of his exile, and Cato was not sorrowful of his death.

Socrates thought his greatest felicity to be by poison, and that noble
Captain, who to save Rome, disdeyned not to ride into the gaping gulf.

Thy desire is to mainteyne a Uoyage into Spain, and to have the full sight
of that noble Army, and thy purpose shall take effect, and thou not deceived
of that thou desire: but I fear me thou will hardly away with the nature of
the Soil, and I am doubtefull that the Country lies full of Souldyoures: yet
upon this condition that thy return be so speedy as thou say, and so thou
promise me to come again in that time thou have set down. I am cont^nt to
grant thy request, and willinglye consent to what thou desire. But whilst
thou art there, be careful of thy diet, and have a regard whom thou choosest
thy companyon, for in that thou know not whom to trust here, thou may
perforce be deceived in a strange place: For the fatherly affection I have
over thee, does wish thee so well as my self: and without thy health, what
happiness can I have? Therefore I charge thee here, upon pain of my
displeasure, and command thee as thou will purchasse my blessing, that thou
be careful of thy own safety, and make so speedy return, as thy self have
promised.

His father immediately furnishing him with every thing apperteyning to such
a voyage, and willing him to be mindful of his promises, committed him to the
gouernemente of the highest, and betook him to the favor of the Floods, there
to try his Fortune amidst the foming froath, and to march in the middle of the
saltishe Seas, where we must leave him to them upon his chance, and betake him
to his close cabin in the stead of his choice Chamber.

I Have thus finished the first part of NARBONVS, and given PHEMOCLES, for a
time, his farewell: you shall shortly hear what news in Spain, and of the
success of the Emperoures Army: where he that before never walked in the
wars, is now wedded to some woe: and he that erst was never over the shoes
in fortunes despite, is now over the boots in enuies disdeyne. I commend him
to the Spanyardes courtesy, whom I doubt will entreat him not curiously,
yet careleslye.

The second part.
NArbonus having escaped the danger of the Floods, and arrived very well on
shore, where he was grown to be^ such a Soldier, as he could shifte with
the best, and dissemble with the most: It happened that when he had been in
the Camp, by the space of three Months, or much about that time, his
Captain, with certain others, went to do a piece of service against the
ennemy, and an exployt which happened not so well for Narbonus as it might have
done, where they had such happy success, and fortune seemed so to favor
them, as they returned with Triumph, and brought away the goal with them:
Retiringe homeward, all the Captains went through a little Town to make
merry, and the Soldiers marched on the backeside of the Town, never staying
till they came at the Camp: Narbonus with certain others, went with their
Captains, and accompanied the^ through ye Town: The cariages went also
through the Town, for that it was somewhat the nearest way: being in the
Town a certain space, some fell to drinkeinge, and some to quarrelling: from
quarrelling, to blows: and from blows, to bloodshed: for with their
quarrelling and the coil they kept, they set all the Town in an vproare, and
all were together by the ears: now the Wine was in the head, and the wit was
out of the brain: This broyle continued so long, till some were hurt, and
some were wounded: some lost their apparel out of the cariages, and some
lost all they had: some went home with one leg, and some left their lives
for a Monument: Narbonus amidst this thronge, and in as great danger as the
most, had discharged his Piece, laden with two Bullettes, full in the breast of
one his own companions, had not an other that saw his meaning, bobbed up the
nose of his Gunne: This drunken fray was in the end pacified, and the matter
taken up amongst themselves, but the cariages were so rifled, and the Wagons so
spoiled, as he that escaped best, lost something, and Narbonus lost just all
that he had, and had not so much left, as a shirte to chaung him, or any
apparel more then he woare on his back to shift him: As for his purse, that
was light, and his money was al gone long before: now therefore began his
misery, and then began he to miss his own Country: before he lacked a
little, but now he began greatly to lament his mishap: finding a convenient
place, and time where none should epsy him, he powered forth his plaintes, and
uttered these words following.

Alas Narbonus, what a Metamorphists art thou made* and how can thy tongue
express the inward grief of thy heart? Can thy tongue unfold the miseries
thou art fallen into? or thy heart imagine the torments thou sustainest? the
one were an endless toil, and the other without the compass of my capassitie:
First the death of thy Father, and the loss of so good a friend: the memory
whereof has taken so deep root in my heart, as I shall never put it out of my
stomach, whose fatherly affections, and whose entire love were so great as any
could wish, and as much as any one could imagine: whose careful cogitations
were always on my well dooinge, and whose mind was often moved with my life
to come: How great had been thy happiness, had thou accompanied him to the
grave? and how favorable had been thy fortune, had thou departed when he
dyed? Were he now here to wayle my want, and to bear a part in this my
perplexed passion, whose Ghost to awaite on, would my soul were set to watch
on: as I unfortunate wretch am ouerwearied with watching, though nolente: and
as my soul is like to be drowned in despair with ye memory of forepassed
things, though against my will: Can the tender tree, the earth taken from the
root, grow green any longer? and can Narbonus, ye sustainer of his life
detained, live any longer? Can the fleeting fish, live out of the wallowing
water? and can the flickering foul fly, without his wings to beat the
weather? Can Narbonus live, not having bread to sustain his hunger? and can I
prosper, not having any food to feed on? no, no: I must pine in penury, and
wear away my days in misery: leave my life in my lustiness, and die in the
best time of my sprouting beauty: O had I stayed still at Wittenberge, yet how
can I wish my soul more harm, the original of my sorrows, and the prime of
my penalty: the beginning of my bitterness, and the first of my frivolous
fortune: My Uncle (forsooth) would vnneathes procure me thither under
pretense of my profit, where I spent all that was left me, and consumed away
my living: there began my want, and here will end my misery: there Fortune
began to frown, and here she will spit her spite: This was the affection of
my Uncle, and this the proud pleasure of his mighty mind. Had I stayed still
in the Country, and had I not come to Wittenberge, my goods had been
increased, and my lyuinge augmented: where now my patrimony is spente, and I
like here to pine: But do thou unjustly condemn thy dear Uncle, and
unadvisedly blame thy faithful friend, whose health depends upon thy hap,
and whose goods consist upon thy well dooinge? O were these my miseries
manifested unto him, or he acquainted with the greatness of my distres, some
means would be wrought to sustayn my want, and some subtle shift devised to
help my calamity: He told me my cheer would be cold, and my lodging would
seem hard: my dainties not many, but my dangers plenty, which I have proved
by experience, though he spoke but by heresay. Had my God been so contented, my
life might have lasted no longer, nor I sustained more misery, but ye other day
bin slain with my companions, and left my life, where they got their deaths:
But I was preserved to a farther inco^uenie^ce, and my life prolo^ged to a
greter mischief: ye spaniel is far happier the^ I, and the barking dog in
better case then my self, for they are rewarded for their brawlinge, but I
like to sterue for my good service.

O how happy are these creatures, whose bellies are always filled with grass,
and whose paunches have ever that suffiseth their hunger* who feed them selves
fat, and then are slain, but I am likely to dye beeinge but carrion, and to
pay my raunsom being no fair flesh: My Unckles servants think much to take
a little toil to feed on what they list, and think they are wronged in
laboring for their vittailes, where the worst morsel they have would preserve
my life, and the least piece of bread prolonge my days: can death it self be
worse then this? nay, how can it be so bad? if death were laid in my dish, my
woes would quickly end: and were my destinies now ended, my miseries would
grow no farther. O had God given man that secrecy, to end his days when he
would, or had he granted him that liberty, to cut a sunder the thread of his
life when it pleased him: should my life then be prolonged one hour, and my
days not ended at this instant?

But Fidelia, in what place rests thy sweet soul? and where now is thy
delicate body? Thou once saw me dying, but now shall shortly hear that I
am dead: would now thou were here to hasten my death, and to give me that end
which is my due: to dispatche my bloominge breath, and to hold my heavy head:
to wipe these tears from off my moist eyes, and to close them up after my
Ghost is once gone: O Fidelia, had my hap been so good, I might have seen
thee again, and challenged thee for my own: or had fortune been so
favorable, I might have inioyed thy company, ye happiest in the world: Had my
heart foreseen this, and my mind imagined these ^aungers, I would have barked
like the Dog in his kennell, and lurked like the Fox in his hole: I would
have lain close like the Lion in his den, and been hidden like the Be in
the Honny comb: But my carckinge was on my credit, and my boasting on my
bravery. O Fidelia, could I have had but one farewell before my departure, and
one kiss to have carried to my grave: thou the most faithful, I the
vnfaithfullest: thou the most freendly, I the vnfreendlyest: thou the most
loving, I the most vnloyall: could not I recovered the Country, so might I had
thy company? could not I that way gained thy good graces, and found thy
freendly favor? where now banished thy presence, and bereaved of thy sight? I
once embraced thy body, and once kissed thy sweet face, and once should have
gotten the heauenlyest thing in this world, and once woonne thee for my wedded
wife: But seeing my simple service could not be seen in this my lingering
life, my death shall make it manifest to all the world, and my soul in despite
of fortune shall awayte on thy blessed body. I die to think that some
unworthy shall possess thee, and fear that one which not deserves so
precious a jewel shall wear thee: knew I by what means to present thee my
heart, the most loyal in this Kingdom of Spain, no other should have the
bestowing of it, but thy sweet self, nor any other buy it but thy heavenly
hands. The Thief has his deserved hire, and the Traitor for his treachery
punished with pain and would God I were the one, or could not escape the
other. But why do I hold my hands from so dying? and stay my knife from
executing my self? were it not offensive to God, and contrary his commaundes,
my heart should quickly consent, and my hand soon strike the stroke. Of all
the Creatures that God has made, and all the features he has formed, Man is
either most unfortunate, or in greatest unhappiness. All other creatures
regard naught but their food to fill their paunches, and care for nothing but
meat to serve their turns, and they all have sufficient, and never any of
them that perish with hunger: but we want, and we wayle, we weep, and we
lament, we cry, and we crave. The first sign of our life after our
procreation, is bitter tears, and the foremost motion of our living souls, is
weeping: a sure sign of our misery to come, and a token, that our life shall
continue with lame^ting: my money is spent long since, and my apparel al lost:
friends here are none that will relieve me, and who will succor me in this
deep distres? but if my back he cold, is not my belly also bare? yes, I
see naught but death before my face, and my lingering life begins to wast:
and this death is most miserable, and in this kind of dying I shall seem the
most vile creature that ever lived, and to sterue thus with hunger, the most
loathsome of any that heertofore has breathed: but in so dying, do there not a
great number lead the dance before thee? and in being so miserable, are
there not many that pine in like perplexity? if I steal any thing to sustein
my pining pau^ch* or filch ought to gorge my greedy gut, death the^ is my due,
and no compassion shall be showed me. O my beloved Phemocles, that I were now at
thy courtesy, and that my plaints were poured forth before thee, that thou
did behold these watrie eyes, and that thou did look upon these blubbred
cheeks: that thou did see this throbbing heart so miserably afflicted, and
that thou did behold my soul so drowned in despair: but to be hold here my
deformed face, and to see thus these eyes suncke into my head, thou would
bear a part I am assured of these my inward miseries: and were there any here
to pour forth some tears with me, or to bewail my want so much as my self,
my heart would quickly yield to the fury of death, and my soul give consent
to yield up my ghost: And gains not death a great jewel, and gets he not
a mighty reward to have me his own? yes trust me: a loathsome body, and a
stinking carcass, a rotten tree, and a consumed carrion. But O good God, are
these the fruits of all wars? and are these the lives of all Soldiers? is
this the life of all those forced by their Princes? and is this the case of all
such as go out of their own Country? the soul Bear finds somewhat to
tear on: and the hungry Tigre gets something to maintain her life: the
Wolf has some what to pray upon, and the wily Fox does not perish with
hunger. Thou feedest O Lord ye young Ravens with ye dew of Heaven, and will thou
suffer us to go into Hell? for want of sustenance we must either pay pence for
yt we take, or render our lives in pawn, give gold, or gain our grave. Thou
have given to every foul of ye air seeds, and to the beasts of ye field
grass to feed on: to the fishes the wide sea to fleet in, and to the vile
worms the rotten earth to live by. These creatures sterue not for lack of
food, nor perish, being pined with hunger. Is man the perfectest creature, and
the likeness of thy own image? have you made him most excellent, and given him
the vilest condition? the best favored, and the worst beloved? the most
superial to look upon, and yet ye most unfortunate of all others. Other thy
creatures stand not one at the mercy of the other, and one is not forced to beg
of the other: one co^de^neth not the other, and none of the^ gives consent to
have the other slain. The Ox is content his fellow shall feed by him, and the
Sheep craves the company of his companions. The Heart will not feed alone,
and the ramping Lion never hurts his fellow, yet we suffer our heeethre^ to
pine in poverty, and see our fellows to die with hunger. Is the shape of man
so goodly, and his condition so vile? his face so amiable, and his nature so
filthy? his life so pure, and his deeds so detestable? We have seen that
brute beasts have fed young children, nourished their natures, and sustained
their lives: if they of nature be so gentle, why should not we be more loving?
if their affection to us be so great, why should it not be far greater to our
selves? O miserable sex, O vile generation, O most vnpure, O most odious of al
others: Should our doings resemble God? why then do we follow the Devil? should
our works be perfect to our maker, why then are we so imperfect toward our
selves? if perfection work such imperfection: and if the inward motions work
such outward misery: if the secret things in nature manifest so great
calamity: why then O God have thou made us ye way to exceed other creatures,
and to excel the^ al in these mysteries? as ye heart, and the mind, the soul
and regeneration: nature yields the^ al their generation, and works the^ al a
beginning, their procreation, and their being: and has not nature wrought yt
in them as they al live, and are all sustained? they are all nourished, and not
one of them perish, for wanting their food. Is then our gain greater? or our
life larger? our happiness comparable to their felicity? and our goodness
like to their pleasure? no Narbonus, thy days must be shortened for lack of
sustenance, and thy life dried up wanting relief. Farewell that noble Country
of Germany, and adue that famous City of Vienna: farewell the Uirgins that
vow vestalitie, and adue thou my faithful Fidelia: farewell my dear Uncle
with the rest of my friends, and adue Phemocles of all the men the only
flower. But miser that I am, to lament my loss, does but increase my sorrow,
and to renew my plaintes, but augment my grief: bestirre therefore thy self,
and walk abroad, happily thou may meet with some that will relieve thy
staruing state, and by chance find out some friend to give thee some food.
But alas, whom shall I ask, or whom shall I call to? whom shall I bewail
my want unto, or who will help me out of this misery? if I go out to seek
some pray, or go about to gain some booty, is not the enemy hard at our
heels, and comes he not close to our Camp? If I be taken I die ten
thousand deaths, and if my life be yielded into his hands, I were better
suffer any torments: perhaps be thrust into their Galleys, which is worse
than thousands of deaths, or put to a worse office, which I were better yield
my self here unto all furies. O infamous agony, and superexcellente
calamity, would to God my soul would now yield the last gasp of this living
life, and I would that at this instant the executioner held the axe over my
head to cut it off: if it were but one death to be taken prisoner, I would of
purpose go to yield my self, but I know not how many deaths I shall die, and
still live, live? I alas live dying, and yet not die, whose case is so hard,
that in staying here I die, and in going abroad to refresh my body, I must
more tha^ die: yet in staying here, my lingering life may wear to some end,
and in going forth, more than death shall be my destiny. In going to seek
relief in our own Camp, and ask there of our own Soldiers, ye grievous
gronings of those afflicted, and the lamentable co^playnings of these infected,
pitifully crying, help, help, yet none helps, nor any succoureth them: some
lie cryinge, and some sprawlinge: some struglinge, and some striving to dye:
would terrify I think the stoutest stomach living, and affray the stongest
heart that has been known, to behold some pitifully lyinge upon the ground,
and some beating their bellies against the earth: some bouncinge them selves
with their fistes, others lyinge with their faces upward: some tearing their
hears, others scratching their faces: some wresting their mouths to speak,
but cannot: some holdinge up their hands, saying, misery, misery: the stenche
of some so strong, and the savor so horrible, as I often wonder that I am not
infected, and many times marvel that I am not incensed: but he that doubts
not death, dreadeth not any danger: To see these pitiful sighs, and to
hear them calling meat, meat: and others drink, drink: and others help,
help: and others I die, I dye: and others kill me, kill me: and others stop
my breath, stop my breath: and others close my eyes: what heart so hard? or
what stomach so stonye? what mind but would be moved to pity? and what
soul but would give some succor, to hear them so pitifully complain, and
so lamentably lament* thinking to come near, to give them some succor, or
imagininge to take hold on them, to help them up: the smell is so terrible,
and the savor so horrible: that had a man the heart of Hercules, or were a man
amongst the puddels of Caron, he could not feel a greater stink, nor help
them any other way: some sprawling out of their Cabins, and some creepinge upon
all four: some tumbling out on their backs, and others offering to go, fall
down again: Others go reelinge and tottering forward, they know not them
selves whether: and others fall suddenly down and never rise again. But alas,
how shall I succor others, that cannot help my self? a blind man may as
well give an eye to another, or the cripple give him a leg that is sound:
Should I say, O mors quam amara: nay, rather O mors quam iucunda: But who
staieth the Tide, and has not his passage? and who tarieth till the hour be
ended, and hears not the clock strike? O that I had a Glass, to behold the
feature of my face, or that my picture were now drawn, and conveyed to my
friends: would they know me? or would they say it is his face? would they
say it resembles the picture of such a one? or would any say it is the
counterfayt of Narbonus? would Fidelia say it is the face of my beloved? or
would Phemocles say it is the picture of my faithful freende? no: they could
not know me, nor tell whom it resembles: But if they did know me, could they
send me relief? or if they had seen it, could they succor me? could they
give me a plaster for my wound, or could they minister Physic for my weak
body? Yes: if not all faithful, yet some would prove loyal: if not all
true, yet some would be trusty* But yet thou may be deceived of thy
imagination, and made frustrate of thy purpose: The longest grass, grows not
on the highest Hill, and the tall Ceder tree bears no good fruit: the
fairest face may be found full of fraud, and in the greenest grass lurketh
the vilest Serpent: thou did never try them, how then can thou trust
them? thou did never prove them, how art thou then certain? thou never
had experience, how then can thou make boast? The Eagle is the fairest
bird, yet is she filthy meat: the fair Faulcon delights thee to hold her
on thy fiste, yet is she no dishe of service: the Lion the goodliest of all
other Beasts, yet no meat for thy eating: If thou give judgment by looks,
thou may live by loss: if thou joy in fair faces, you may be mocked in
their foul fashio^s if thou rejoice in sweet words, thou may mistake them,
and then sour sauces are better: do thou not often see a rusty Rapier, in a
painted sheathe, and a goodly purse filled with counters: under brave apparel
often walks a botched body, and in a brave body may be a defiled soul: the
sweet musk is not pleasant to eat, and the Lilly flower has no good taste:
the Nettle looks green as other herbs, and the thistle bears a fair
blossom: experience teaches thee, and thy own reason should cause thee
conceive so much: As faith is flickering, so are friends ^ained: if I had the
wit of Themistocle^, and the experience of Phillip, I might be deceived in the
one, and mistook in the other: Caine offered freendly, to talk with his
brother Abell, and then slew him: and Judas kissed Christ, before he betrayed
him: Thou love them dearly, but art not certain they favor thee heartily:
they may speak thee fair, yet flatter falsely: profess ye favoring of thy
fortune, yet repine at thy prosperity: yt Crocadile when she has caught a man,
first weepeth and then deuoureth him: and the Cat first culleth the Mouse
before she eat him: the Fly trusts ye blaze of the candell till she is
burnt, and the old dog plays so long with the whelpe till he bite him:
when the Lion is full gorged the other beasts play before him, but when he
begins to roar, they all hide them selves or run out of his sight: Let the
simplicity of small things make thy wit grow greater: happy are thy friends
for they live in prosperity, but unfortunate is Na^bonus who pineth in
adversity: looking long against the sun will make a man blind for a time,
and I with lookinge on my beloved was deprived of my fences: my long lookinge
lyked me to love, and my louinge has lost me my lyberty: But unfortunate,
do thou condemn thy friends, and blame her who lyked thee best, who
prefer^ed thee before any other, and who lyked thy love, but regarded not thy
lyuinge: who embraced thy behavior, and marked not thy rytches: who took
pleasure in thy wisdom, and wayed not thy wealth: who honored thy health,
and cared not for thy coin: Cast therefore these imaginations from thee, and
de^e away these doubts: be therefore more patiente, and pity will preserve
thee: he ruled by reason, the larger will be thy redress: be counseled by
instructions, the surer thy safegarde. And seeing thou art entered in these
disputations, and moved the matter thy self: think thou much to fall, when
mighty Princes have fled? do thou mourn in misery, and have not thy betters
pined in penury? may not thy state be stirred, when Kings seats have been
moved? happily the Lord has thus plagued thee to prove thee, and thy patient
abiding may cause him love thee: thy sins have bin innumerable? why should
not thy punishments be many? thy offenses have been great, why should not
thy plagues be grievous? Is not the offender punished by death? why should not
I be tormented living? though the Lord bruise my boanes, he can make me
hole: and though he beat me, yet will he not slay me: Who better beloved of
God then David, who more plagued for his offenses? he a mighty Prince, his
offenses great, and therefore his punishments many? Was not Nabuchodonezer in
his time ye greatest Prince of the world, and was ever any so punished for his
pride? his mind was beastly toward his God, therefore was he used like a
Beast: he a great King, he a defiled member: the greater his punishments,
the more his misery: After the great conquestes of Alexander, and that he had
gained the third part of the world, he thought the name of a man not of
sufficient calling, but would (forsooth) be saluted by the name of a God: he
was therefore paid his pasport with death, and was it not due for such and
usurping Rebel, that thought not the name of Emperor sufficient, but would be
called the Son of Jupiter: That noble Pompey, whose memory is yet fresh in
our minds, and whose noble deeds shall never be put in oblivion: his conquest
was great, but his misery was more: and the multitude of his calamities were
not so much, but the remembrance of his cruel death was greater: and noble
Pompey* had thy good fortune been coequall thy valiant mind, thou had
stained thy predicessours, and put out the name of thy progenitors: If these
with a thousand more, the noblest that ever were bred swam but a small time in
security, why should my hap pass theirs, and my fortune be preferred before
their felicity. The dise are cast, and each one has his chance: some win,
some lose: some spend, some spare: some have, some had: all can not be rich,
and all shall not be poor: some Kings, some Beggars, some of low estate, some
Princes of the world: We can not all be happy, neither all haylesse: and since
my ha^ is bad, why should I repine? not because my case is worse than theirs,
but that being badde, I know not how to amend it: The Dog knows his clogge,
and the Horse is not ignorant of his saddle: the Bird her cage, and the Bear
his Master: What a secrecy therefore is this in nature? and from whence
comes this motion? that all other Beasts we can reclayme and make ientle,
but our own fancies we can not ru^e, neither bridle our own affections: this
is the weakness of our imperfection, and the vnstayednes of our desires: Ca^ we
govern al things and not rule our own thoughts? can we bind the brains of
all other things, and have not the power to moderate our own meditations? O
the imbecilitie of our nature, and the weakness of our minds, so vile, and
so foolish, so proud in our own conceytes, and so stately in our tottering
estates: as wavering as the wind, and as contrary as the weathercocke: The
Cock croweth when it is day, and the Sparrow chirpeth in the morning: the
Lark lifts up her warbling notes, and all Birds rejoice in their kind: they
take no care, nor are troubled with any thoughts, no cogitations trouble their
minds, nor any fancies fly before their faces: they love, and they la^ke
not, they rejoice, and they sing, they praise God in their kinds, and are never
troubled with any losses: they fear no robbing, nor dread any spoiling, they
doubt no murdering, neither do they fear fighting, and I think they are
never in love, but that only time of procreation. But alas, what avails these
to the safety of thy self? or in what respect is this a furtherance to thy
health? if I die here, what shall I care to try the faithfulness of my
friends? and if I go not home again, what will their love do me good? I think
one will wish me well, and another will rue my hard hap: one will be sorrowful,
and another would be glad to do me good: but whilst ye grass grows, the
Horse sterueth: and whilst the salve is making, the wound festereth: whilst
yt pardon is suing, the condemned is hanged: and whilst they are providing for
my prosperity, I may perish: Whether shall I go, or to what place shall I
direct my steps? the Camp is a place of small comfort, except I desire to see
the portrature of death, or except I mean to dispatch away my life, except I
mean to be cut like the plant in the prime of his perfection, and ex^ept I
mean to seek my joy by violating some dangerous divination.

The Eagle houering in the air, and soaring in the wind, ceasseth not to get
some food to fill the gaping mouths of her young ones, and never stays till
she have prayed of some thing to cease their crying: but who will feed thee,
to cause thee cease lamenting? or who will bring thee any thing to make thee
cease thy playnts? though the soul Raven suffer her brattes to live certain
days without food, in the which time they are nourished with the dew of
heaven, yet once perceiving them to be her own, she provides somewhat to make
them cease crying, and brings the^ food to stop their yauling mouths: but
who will give thee a morsel of bread to sustain thy weak nature? or who will
minister a cup of wine to moderate thy thirst? The fierce Tigres, whose natures
are counted most vile, and whose substance most loathsome, will suffer their
young ones to tear their pappes, pouring out the milk, and rather suffer
themselves to be slain, then that their young should want, or not be relieved:
but who will help thee with any thing? or give one little piece of silver to
save thy life? O that the celestial powers have given man that nature so
excellent, and yet to be so vilely abused: when we are at the best, our case is
but bad, must not then the woorst be miserable, are we not borne erying, and
dye lamenting? sorrowful that we are come into the world, and then lamenting
our so suddayne departure? when the beginning is with weeping, must not the
end be with wayling? But why are we so borne weeping, and for what cause so
procreated waiting? because our estate is so miserable, and we so vile of our
selves, our sins like to be great, and our offenses like to offend God so
far, as it is but needful we should always lament our lives, and
necessary that we should ^o complain our estates. But why are we so
miserable, and wherefore has God given us no more perfect procreation? Because
othe^^ise we should be so proud as Lucifer, and so be thrown down into Hell,
yet were we better feel the heavy hand of God, and pray for repentance, or
call to him for grace, who will so speedily give it us, as we do hastily call
for it: and to make trial of our natures, has he not wrought by sundry
means, and experienced by sundry men? Was not Job tormented with botches and
biles, and plagued with sores, and scabbes? and though he suffered him to be
tried, yet did he not quite reject him: some tried by the fire, and some
persecuted by Princes: some by Shipwreck, and some by emprisonment: some by
banishmente, and some by the wars: some by one thing, and some by another:
some made a Metamorphosis, and some misshapen: some ouglie, and some loathsome:
all to try how patientlye they can bear the cross of the Lord, and how
manerlye they can march in misery: how they can walk so weerie a warfare, and
how they can take so tedious a travel. Has not he made as well some for
praise, as fashioned others for disprayse? some for honor, and some for
dishonor? some renowned, and some poor in person? Has he not made as well
the Snake, as fashioned the Ecle? as well the Toade, as the Frogge? as well the
Dragon, as the Ox? as well the Lion as the Lamb? and as well the Tigre as the
Dove? some honored, some hated: some loved, some loathed: some embraced, some
detested: some we fly from, some we favor: some follows us, some fears us:
the face of man I think is the cause, and his favor, in that it resembles
his celestial face, whose feature we are not unlike, that same is it which
other creatures are afraid of, and that the cause why they fly from the
presence of man: they fly, and they are afraid: they tremble, and they
trudge: they quake, and they quiver: yet is not man to be compared to a great
number of Beasts in strength, or like to them in stature, for swiftness, or
for feercenesse. Is not the Lion the strongest of all others to his stature,
and yet is he fearful to encounter with a man? is not the Tigre fiercest, yet
dares not behold the face of a man? the Crocodile being pursued, runs
away: the Bear will rather be pursued, than follow: and the Elephant, greatest
of all four footed, yet reclaimed to be as gentle as a Dog: for did the
Horse know his strength, he would never wear a saddle, or wear the Bull
privy to his might, he would never take the yoke: If man being one of the
least in substance, and none of the greatest in perfection, yet bears the
greatest sway, and rules all things, and they tremble not at his sight, in
that he is of himself to be feared, but because God has wrought that in his
face that makes them fearful, and God has hidden from their knowledge his
strength and prowess, and these his creatures never strive for superiority,
neither does the one fear the other: The Fox goes not about to slay his
fellow, neither will one Lion kill the other: do they strive who is greatest?
or who shall go foremost to the field? which is most beautiful to behold? or who
is best beloved? no: the least lives quietly by the greatest, and the
stro^gest disdeine not the company of ye weakest: Wit the Heart pursue his
fellow? or the Wolf follow his fellow to slay him? the least grow by the
greatest, and the little shrubbes prosper amidst the sturdie Oaks: does not
the Yuie grow about the stoutest Elm? and does not the Hazell grow by the
great Beeche? does not the little Uiolet sprout beside the tall Ceders? and
does not the Dasie grow in the middle of the Forest? though the highest reach
to Heaven, yet do the least prosper so well as they: Will the Eagle go about
to kill his fellow, or the Cormorant to devour his kind? will the Cocatrice
infecte his like, and one Toade poison the other? no: for their natures are
contrary the dispositions of man, and their minds are not moved with such
high motions: for the nature of man is excellent, and his substance far
above other creatures: but corrupted, it is most vile, and wrested to the
worst, is most loathsome: for every beast retains his proper form and shape,
and does but after nature and his kind: which in respect of us is base, and to
our nature detestable. And wherefore is it that Emperors, and Kings, Princes,
and rulers, have at al times maintained such monstrous wars, and evermore
used so the sheading of blood, but to make subjects their inferiors, and to
have the name to be greatest: to have their fame spread abroad, and to be
mightiest upon earth: Had Alexander been contented to have lived quietly in
Macedon, and ruled that only Empire, as his Father did before him, he might
have continued many years, and retained that always which his heirs might
have kept after him: The greater man, the more his danger, the more his fear,
and the greater his care: The great Oak gives a great crack at his fall,
where the slender shrubbe makes no noise: the high Turret is in more danger,
then the Sheepheardes Cottage: the ritche man fears robbinge, more then the
poor dreadeth danger: The ficklenes of the Prince, is greater then the fear
of the subject: who lives so well contented as the poor Fisherman? or who so
merrily as the Cobbler? who sleapeth more quietly then the hired servant? and
who pypeth so pleasantly as the Shepherd? The fatter the horse is, the fuller
of diseases: and the richer a man is, the likelier to be robbed: the more the
mighty heapeth up, the more unquietly he sleapeth: If fortune therefore favor
thee, be thankeful: and if the world go well on thy side, praise God for it:
temper so thy affections as pride creep not into thy heart, and bridle so thy
mind, that thou be the same man thou wast before, for thou little know how
sudden may be thy fall, and art ignorant how speedily the Lord will deprive
thee of thy pleasures: Thou live happily, and thy state is stayed: but do
thou not see another pine in penury, and fall into great misery: good Fortune
guides the ship, and felicity sittes on the Pumpe: but Envy may step in for
a show, and Disdain may give the a soucinge blow: The highest tree is often
shaken, but when it falls the crack is great: the mighty Prince deprived of
his dignity, his case is lamentable: but the poor man if he lose all his
goods, cares not greatly, for that they were but small: The wind blows
hardest upon the sails of the greatest Ship, and the little Boat can pass
quietly in the narrow River: and goes not the cock boat more safely in the
quiet calm, then the great Hulke sayleth surely in the maine Sea? Is not the
Frog in less danger to be taken, the^ the Samon to be caught? the little
Lamb lives, when the fat Wether goes to the slaughter: the Hind feeds
still in the Lawnes, when the fat Bucke is pursued: the smallest things, the
less regarded, and the greater they are, the more is their danger: the Lion
is pursued, when the Lamb sucketh the teate of her damme: and the bristled
Boar is roused out of his Den, when the sucking Pigge sleapeth quietly: the
Bull is bayted, when the Calfe feeds in the feeldes: and the Hearne is souced
at, when the sneaking Snight sits by the rivers side: Who therefore would
desire to be rich, or who covet to be greater: to be famous, or to have a
name? to be called a God upon earth, when his end shall be as miserable as a
beast, as waueringe as the wind, and as totteringe as a Reed: as uncertain
as the helm of the Ship, and alteringe as the Moon: like the untimely
fruit, falling from the tree before it be riped: and like the curnell of a
Nutte, eaten with a worm: so unsavory is the highest estate, and so dangerous
the seat of mighty men, if Fortune once gin to frown, and good hap be gone
out of a man's reach. What a life therefore is this, and how repleat with
misery? how insatiable, and how void of all goodness? when the highest is so
slippery, how shall the lowest be sure? yet I think the least is the safest,
and the lowest the surest: For who eats his bread better then the laboring
man? and who feeds with a better stomach, then he that has travailed all
the day: I have wrought hard says he this day, therefore now will I eat
mainely: then happiest is the least, and unfortunate the greatest: not so
neither: would the greatest temper his affections as he might, and use his
riches in so good order as he ought, his estate is most happy, and he most
bound to Fortune: For are the great Princes of the world unhappy, for that
they are mighty? and are they not fortunate, for that they are rich? no: for
because they could not rule with reason, nor moderate their minds to enjoy
quyetly, that which they possessed. He that climeth high, great is his fall,
and the aspiringe mind, comes often short home: the fair Rose cannot grow,
but every one will be pluckinge at it: and the goodly Pomgranate cannot hang
on the Tree till it be ripe: the fairest Faulcon is desired of all: and the
sweeter the Grape, the more do geather of it: the mightier the estate, the more
desired, and thee goodlier possessions, the more suitors: The new builte House
is sooner bought then the ragged walls, and a fat and lustye Horse sooner
caught up, then a lean and starued Jade: the best are most desired, and the
least little regarded.

But Narbonus, it is now time to cast of these cogitations, and to leave
deuyninge of matters not touching thy estate: thou see no body speaking to
thee, nor any one that makes thee answer: no man comes at thee, nor any
seeks to relieve thee: Therefore bestir thy self and get thee abroad: arm
thy self with patience, and in time thou may find relief: And there withal
he went to borow some money of his Captain, promising to answer it when the
pay day came, but he would not lend him a mite, but sent him away as well
satisfied as when he came to him: Thus fortune who erst (as he thought) hunge
about his neck, laughed him now to scorn: Who had then seen his visage, and
marked the feature of his face, would have said it resembled rather the
counterfeyt of one goinge to be laid in the grave, then the lively hue of
him, who so late bare such a port in Vienna.

Roming thus up and down the Camp, and going from one place to another, he
met by chance with a friend of his, and one of old accquaintaunce: the other
had a little silver in his purse, and better stoared then Narbonus: therefore
they went both to dinner, and got such victuals as their little money would
reach too, where he fed like a hungry horse, trauayled in a winters day:
Then Narbonus bewrayed unto him his great mishappes, and lamented his ariuall
into that miserable Country, recounting unto him the mere misery that he was
like to come too: and declaringe the ungratefulness of his Captain, and
Countrymen, he could not so moderate his mind, nor so satisfy his appetite:
not so bridle his affections, nor so conceal the inward anguishe of his
heart: but that he burst forth into bitter weepinge, and so pitifully the
tears flowed down his face, as if then he would have dyed, and never
returned out of that place: Thus with daily lamenting his face was grown so
pale, and with continual weeping his cheeks looked so wanne, as those which
before had long used his company, would not then have known him.

The other seeing him so lament, and so pitifully to complain, comforted him
so well as he could, and using such persuasions as he thought best, saying
that weeping was no way to preserve his health, nor lamenting any means to
make his sorrows slake: He therefore like a friend parted stakes with him, and
gave him half the money in his pursse, willing him (so long as he had any)
boldly to command it, to the which liberal offer, Narbonus yielded him thanks
for his courtesy, and gratefulness for his good will.

Thus they departed, and Narbonus was better contented with that little sum,
than if before he had gotten ten times the value: but the quantity was so
small, that the joy could not last long: for as a Candle consumes to nothing,
or as the deaw dries up with the heat of the Sun: as the wax melts
before the fire, or the frost steals away so soon as the thaw comes: so
the substance of his pursse diminished by little till all was gone, and then
his grief grew as great as before: And for that there was so small store of
money in the Camp, the victuals decreased, and was very hard to get: for the
Souldioures were so ill paid, and so hardly dealt withal, whether by the ill
demeanours of the Captains, or that the fault was in the receyuers: but this
is most sure, that the poor Souldioures had none, neither any could they get:
by reason whereof, they were forced to rob, and driven to steal: to spoil
the cariages coming toward the Camp, and to take away the money from the
^ictuallers, which was the cause that the provision came not, and if there came
any, they were forted either to sell it upon credit, or to carry it home
again: The complaining, and the running, the lamenting, and the wayling, was
intolerable amongst all sorts, and outrageous in every degree, as the sights,
and the hearings, with the insatiable rigor that there was used, would have
moved the hard stones, and have forced the stony rocks to weep: Some cried
out they would neither watch nor ward any longer: and some said, they would
go serve the Enemy, and so end their days, rather than stay there to die
with famine: some said, they would take up their Ensigns and march
homewardes, and some said they would go out and spoil the Country: some
determined one thing, and some imagined another: As the Captains feared some
inconvenience would grow of this mutiny, and doubted some danger would
shortly ensue, therefore stopped their mouths with a little parcel of their
pay, and offered them part till all came. Now if the old Souldyours were thus
afflicted, and the ancient Captains so tormented, Narbonus was also*
bestraught, and incensed: for here you should have met them going to such a
Town, and there running to another village: here ransacking such a house, and
there robbing such a Castle: here pulling down a Cloister, and there
breaking into an Abbey: some took the Countrymen their friends, and
tormented them, to cause the^ confess their money: some with their Snaphaunces
and fir^l^ckes opened the vices, and put their thumbes therein, till the blood
came out at the ends, or till they were so thin as a paper, and some they
hanged by their members, to make them confess: some they took and hanged,
till they were almost dead, and some they bound strings about their foreheads,
till their eyes were like to come out: This was the misery, and this the
calamiti^: this the monstrous outrage they used, and this their hard dealing:
all for want of that which should sustain them, and for lacking their pay
which should have sufficed them: There came the complaints to the Coronels,
and here were their doings put up to the Captains: some lamented the loss of
their goods, and others the forgoing of their children: some that their
Cattle were all stolen away, and others that their houses were rifled and
nothing left. The Coronels seeing this, and the Captains perceiving the vile
dealings of the Souldioures, gave unto every one a little piece of money, and
so stopped their throtes for a time, setting down such straight laws, and
making such prestricte decrees, that those which went out of the Camp without
license, should abide the bargain for it, and those that stole, should be
rewarded with a halter: and in that the relief was so small, and their money so
little, many were executed, and a great number put to death: some were shot
through by their Corporals, and some passed the pikes: some were hanged, and
some otherwise punished: Which sight so terrified Narbonus, and put him into
such fear, as he knew neither how to do, nor which way to besturre himself:
he therefore coming to his stately cabin, thought to recreate himself with
some sleep: but alas, he was not in his bed at Vienna, nor at home in his
Uncles house, neither had he such a friend as Phemocles to utter his mind
unto, he therefore complained to himself as follows.

And have thou indeed sold thy own Country to buy here a beggars portion?
and have thou forsaken thy loytering life at home to find such infamy in a
strange place? And have thou berest thy self of those passing pleasures
wherewith of late thy stomach was full gorged, to enjoy here this pining
penury? And have thou so refused to die in her arms, whom above all the
world thou did honor, to leave thy life here amidst these carrion carcases,
whose smell is intolerable, and whose look most loathsome? before I came
hither, I heard those that thus talked, and had this conference amongst
themselves of it, some would to God we might have Wars, then should we be
regarded: O said others, this peaceable time is very ill for us, and not good
for any: would others say, if the Emperor maintained some wars, and that we
might have pay, we should be merry, where now we want much: upon this I
imagined with my self, and thought in my mind, the wars surely are very
beneficial, and the life of a Souldioure excellent, otherwise, they would not
so earnestly desire them, nor so willingly wish for them. I imagined there
hanged bags of money upon every headge, and in every house there was some
hidden: but alas, how contrary do thou find their sayings? and how false
their speakings, how tattling their toungs, and how their lips are larded
with lies: we can not see when our hap is good, nor be content when fortune
favors us: O the misery: and the calamity, the distresses, and the sharp
shoures, the bitter blastes, and the cold couerings, the hungry bellies, and
the dreadful dangers, these are the paternes of our pining penuries, and the
signs of our surest safegards: when the heauenliest hap that we hope for is
death, what shall be the least of our felicities.

The Apprentise looks to the discharge of his business, and the sale of his
wares, eats when him lists, and at night sleeps quietly in his bed:
though the Mariner be sometimes tossed on the wallowing waves, and feel
otherwhiles the force of the floods, yet so soon as he comes on shore, he
reioyseth with his wife, and makes merry with his family. The crafts man
scorched with the summers blaze, and chippred with the Winter blast, has money
and meat for his labor, and sleeps quietly in his bed. But when do we
sleep soundly, or when do we slumber safely? does not our sleep as well
nourish, as our meat sustain? but how shall we do that neneuer have the one,
and always want the other. How dangerous are the feats of wars, and how
insatiable the sauce of this safety? how loathsome the manner of this diet,
and how hard to digest? does not this grudge my mind, and am I not pricked in
my own conscience to rob, and to rifle: to steal, and to scratch: to borow,
and to brawle: to catch, and to scould: to swear, and to stare: to lie, and
to lurch: to flatter, and to dissemble: to beguile, or to be deceived: Then to
see them so tormented, and to behold them so punished, so racked, and so rent:
so trodden, and so stamped on: to confess their Coin, and to bring their
bags to light: to show the faces of their fair Duccates, and to pull out
their painted Portigues: one complayneth, saying, I have lost that he sta^e,
and another, he has begged that which I have borrowed: then says another, I
will go raunsacke such a house, and thou shall have half the spoil: then
another says, I had stolen four fat Oxen, and a knave so bad as my self,
has taken them from me and deceived me of my purpose: One robs Peeter, to
pay Paul: and the strongest thief escapes best: our meat is not daintely
dressed, nor we so curious to pinch courtesy, but rather then stay to long,
eat it half raw: as for sauce, we never tarry for it, neither do we want
any to chew it for us: the best is, we have fair Fountains to cool our
dried throats, and fine Wells to quench our great thirst: and were our meat
as plentiful as our water is cold, we should have enough of the one, and to
much of the other: We think not scorn as did the Prodigal Child, to eat
with the Swine, and to devour our meat as they do: if we eat not with
them, we fill our paunches where they did feed: we have no great choice of
dishes, for he that has above one, forfaiteth the other to the Prince: and
we have a law, that any man may not eat above once in the day, except he
have meat: when we lay us down on our soft Fetherbourdes, and think to take
a little nappe, Master Lowce ^ommeth craftily under one of our sides, or else
comes stealing at our backs when we are sleepinge: but I marvel being a
Spaniard borne, that he will so invade us in the night, and of so ancient
name, yet come so craftily behind us, he lays on his lunchinge lips of our
flesh, and leaves not manching before he have filled his belly: but though
he bite hard, he never eats us: But Narbonus, were this Mart now to make,
and this bargain again to bind: with my consent thou should never hurt
Soldier, except thou did steal away his dinner: Thou might have
stayed in Vienna, and looked to thy Unckles business, kept his accomptes, and
dispatched his matters: conferred with his creditours, and talked with his
Tenauntes: Nay, thou might have used the company of thy faithful friend,
and talked with him in the Town: walked with him in feeldes, and exercised thy
self in his company: thou pleased his fancy, and he lyked thy honesty:
learned lessons on thy Lute, and sought out Songs and Sonets: used instruments
to refresh thy wits, and exercised recreatitions for the health of thy body:
but now thou must forget these thy pleasures past, and recount thy miseries to
come.

Thus tumblinge about in his Cabin, first on this side, then on that other, now
imagining this thing, and then an other quite contrary: At last he perceived
the dawning, and saw the light come in upon him: not long after there came
certain of his acquaintance, and some that wished him well, tellinge him they
had gotten license of his Captain, and a Pasport of his own hands, for four
days, to rome the Country, and to take what boot they could get*

Narbonus at this gentle offer made no denial, but starte up and went alonge
with them: the first day they spent, and got just nothing: the second day
proved as benificiall as the first: the third night they came to a little
Castle, where they went in to take up their lodginge, for that they saw the
place to be strong, and likely there should be some thing within it:
lookinge in every hole, and ransacking every corner, they hapt into a pigges
stie, or a swines house, where they found six young suckinge Pigges, but the
damme was not there, which they imagined was taken away not long before, or
that same very day: hear they made a great feast, and here was great cheer
prouidinge, but there was not one amongst them that was a cunninge Cook, or
not any that could well dress this meat, but left almost half the hair
strickinge on their backs, and roasted them so ill, that Narbonus by the space
of three Months after, felt no other savor as he thought but those
stinkinge pigges, and all the meat that he eat as he thought tasted of
them: the day followinge they returned homewarde, and hasted to the Camp, yet
they could not make such haste, but they were benighted, nor go so fast but
that they were beguiled: Therefore espying a fair Castle, and a good place to
lodge in, they went into it, and there took up their lodginge: they shut the
doors close to them, and making a great fire laid them down to sleep:
Narbonus was very well warmed, but lyked not his bed: he therefore got to the
top of a Cupborde standinge hard bye, and there couched himself: being sound
a sleep, about midnight he turned to the other side. It happened his Pellet
purse was open, yet tied fast to his Girdle: and when he had turned him self,
his Bullettes all dropped out, and fell all scatteringe on the flower: which
beeinge bourded, and the place where he lay far from the ground, they made
such a noise, and so great a clatteringe, as if twenty Gunnes had been
discharged one after an other: The company that lay by the fire, beeinge sound
on sleep, starte up so sodaynely, as if they had been assailed by the enemy:
cryinge out, we are betrayed, we are betrayed.

Narbonus sound a sleep, and starting up to take his piece fell down from the
Cupbourde, and made such a noise with the fall, as if the wall had been broken
down upon them, or if one of the Chambers had fallen, and with fear had little
hurt, but was amazed with the fright: but the company ran some one way, and
some an other: some tumblinge over their fellows, and some knockinge their
shinnes against the posts: some ran to the doors, and others pulled out
their Rapiers: some sought for fire to light their Matches, and some not
thoroughly waked ran they knew not whether: some quaked, and some quiuered: some
had forgotten where they had bestowed their furniture, and some had lost their
Gunnes: In the end one had lighted a wax candle, which was found in a Church
the day before.

Narbonus who perceived the cause of this sudden vproare, and knew the euente
of all this matter, fell to persuading them, and showing them the occasion of
this sudden noise, some believed him, and others denied it: then taking the
Candle, and shewinge them the place where he fell, and the Bullettes not yet
taken up, they believed that which was so manifest, and doubted not of the
matter when they saw the truth before their faces: When all was pacified, and
every thing quiet, they fell in a great laughter to see their own folly, and
iested out the matter merrily: for Narbonus was in all the fault, and he had
taken the greatest hurt: afterward they slept soundly till it was day light,
and were not troubled with any more such false alaromes: so soon as it was day,
and that the sun began to shine, they marched toward the Camp, and came
home in good time, but their gains were small, saving they had filled their
hungry paunches: Not long after, Narbonus went forth again, beeinge
requested by some his friends, who was better contented to go abroad, then
to stay steruinge in the Camp: where they travailed all the day, but found
just nothing: When it drew toward night, they approached to a Castle not
far from them, which they thought a commodious place for them to lodge in,
and good for their purpose: This Castle was Moated, and in the Dikes they
found very good Fish: and findinge Nets in the house, they drew great plenty
out of the Moate: being busied about the dressing of this fish, and wearied
with their travail before: it grew late in the eueninge, and by their
imagination about ten of the clock: It happened the night before, there
lodged other in the same place about the number of fortye, and all of their
own Camp, who repaired thither, thinkinge to lodge as before: they had left
a Gate open, and this company came into the Court: where perceyuinge great
lights within the house, knew not what to imagine: one perceived them that was
within the house, and shot a piece over them, at the discharging whereof, all
this company lay close: Coming into the Court, they shut the gate after
them, and left one of their company without, who romed up and down he knew not
whither: they within the house concluded to put out all the lights, and to go
out closely at a back gate.

There left they their Fish hanging over the fire, and went closely out at a
posterne gate, where hard by the house they laid them selves close in ambush,
meaning to set upon them at advantage when they came forth.

Lying thus closely that they could not be perceived, the fellow running up and
down, came just amongst them where they lay: which perceived by one of the
company, ran toward him, saying, Rendera vou viliaco. The fellow amazed,
and thinking of no such matter, yielded himself, thinking he should die no
other death: whom after they had long examined, found him to be one of their
own Camp, who told them the whole matter, and how those within were of their
own company: then went they all in, and feasted themselves with the Fish that
hung over the fire.

The day following, they marched all toward the Camp, where they found
small-cheere, and worse lodging. Not long after, Narbonus got a pasport of
his Captain, for himself, and other company: the first day they lost their
labor, but for a little rotten fruit that hung upon the trees, the next day
they came into a Uillage, where they found two Calves, which they made ready,
and thought to make good cheer withal, but their meat was not half roasted,
nor their feast begun, when one of their company espied by chance a great
number at the Towns end, which he thought were the Enemies, he therefore
ran in, and told it to his company, some took ^^e spittes with the meat
on them, and went a good space before them: the other came something behind,
meaning to fight, if the enemy followed, but they were but a little out of the
Town, when they saw the other hard at their heels.

Here began a pretty Skirmishe, and the supposed enemies were half so many
again as the other: they therefore pursued botelye, and the other mainteyned
still their Shot, marching on apace: thus they followed by the space of two
miles, till in the end they recovered a Woodde, which perceived of the others,
they retired back, and this good company had no hurt, but one man shot
into the leg, which was without danger: there they roasted their meat
again, and there ended their Banquet.

The next day repairinge toward the Camp, they passed through a Woodde,
and as they went a long, they perceived some company: then one discharged a
Piece, to know whether they were the Enemies, or not: then repairinge the one
company near the other, there began a hot Skirmishe, and continued a
certain space: they had the trees to defend them, and so fought a long
space, without any slain: in the end, there was a Prisoner taken, and they
likewise had taken one, which examined, they were found to be friends, then
they left off with hurt on either side, and laughed well at the matter.

Afterward they departed to the Camp, and Narbonus never after went abroad,
for he grew shortly so sick, as he doubted greatly his recovery: which his
Captain seeing, and suspecting that he could not live, was content to let him
go home, if he would, for that there went a great number besides himself
very sick, and marvelous weak: he made no refusal, but departed straight
toward the Sea: when he came there, the Ship was already provided for the
sick Souldioures, and he was appointed one amongst them: and seeing the
company, some sick of the Plague, and others the sores running on them,
thought with himself that those smelles would kill him, and if he went with
them, he could not live till he came to Vienna: therefore determined rather
to die there, than to end his life amongst such loathsome creatures: and then
he remembered, that to dye amongst them, and to be cast over boorde, his
Uncle should never here of his death, nor any of his friends know where
he was become, and dying in that place, and laying there his bones, it might
be known to his Uncle, and notifyed to the rest of his friends: but better
hap came to him than he looked for, and fortune now began to be
favorable, that long had hated him.

After the departure of these Sick Creatures, there came to the house where
Narbonus lay, a Merchaunte, who was ready to take Ship fraughted to Vienna,
and stayde but even for the next Tide.

Talking of some matters, Narbonus understood that he was of Vienna, and also
knew his Uncle, and therefore offered willingly if he would, to go in his
Ship, to which great courtesy Narbonus made no denial, but seemed the
best contented man living. The appointed hour now come, and all things in
readynesse, they wayed their Anckours, and hoysed up their Sails: the wind
filled their Sails with a sweet soft gale, and the Seas seemed very
favorable to travel on, yet Narbonus was very fearful, and he doubted
greatly of his passage: for being strong and lusty, at his coming over, and
yet extreme sick, he thought now being so weak, that he must needs dye:
but he was so weak, that the Sea could not make him sick, but he that in
six days before tasted no meats, began now to seed hungerly.

Sailing toward his desired home, as many sundry cogitations assailed him, as
he thought there were Stars in the Sky, he remembered his dear Uncle, and
the pitiful words he would use to him when he came home: he marvelled
whether he would be perplexed, seeing him so miserable, or rejoice of his safe
return: how he would digest the discourtesie of his Captain, and the hard
dealing with him, that showed him so fair a face in the time of prosperity,
but regarded him not drowned in adversity. Then he marvelled that Phemocles
neither sent letter to him, nor certified him by any messenger, doubting him
to be but fickle, and friend in felicity, unsteadfast, and unstayed, fleeting
from him in this unfortunate time, and giving him over, when he most needed
his help, doubting their former proceedings, and mutual amity, to be drowned
in the flood of forgetfulness, and put into everlasting oblivion, he being in
security, and the other in calamity, mistrusting those faithful vows, and
entire embracings, would be left without liking, and conveyed into
curiousness: Then blamed he himself for judging so hardly of his friend, and
condemning him without any proof that had not yet falsified his fidelity, nor
violated his honesty: Then remembered he the imbracings at their meetings,
that should enterchangeably pass from one to the other, and the pretty phrases
that should be used between them, would burn their boiling breasts, and
inflame their frying fancies, to possess that place of privilege, possessed
before by them: musing whether Phemocles would most rejoice, or he be most
glad: for that the one was forced by his father, the other constreyned not with
his own consent: then he imagined how they should diet their affections, and
use their amity, so as they might never be weerie of their love, but make it
seem fresh, as at the first.

Amongst other his cauilling cogitations, and fond fancies that thus assailed
him, Fidelia was neither forgotten, nor out of the number: But if the truth
were known, her name called first in question, happily whither absence had
procured dislikinge, and choice had been made of such as were no flinchers,
but would stick to their tacklinges, and fade like every frost, but bide all
bruntes, and have a shade for every shower, and a salve for every sore: then
feared he her secrecy, and doubted she was so close as a Sieve, that it was
known to her Father, and so might hinder their pretense: the inconvenience
that might be gotten thereby, and the preiudicialitie it might procure: for as
it was hot with one hand, so might it be cooled with one Card: then he
mused on the marriage day, and the solemnizing thereof, the courtous crew that
should be invited, and their passaunces in pleasure, with the celebration of
their fortunate fidelity, lincked in the bands of amity, determined the
time, and the place: drowned almost in these cogitations, and wallowing in the
fits of his fancy, new supplies always assailed him, and contrary came in
their places, like the water bubble in a raynie day, or when the weather is
settled to rain, one dies and an other rises in that place: or like the Moon
in a winters night, when the weather is warm, when the Clouds rock a pace,
and pass fast over her: now is she hidden, and then shows her self again:
Or like as when an army marches by, or passes a long: some go always bie,
and others possess their places: or like to the running of a soft River, or
the passinge of a narrow flood that runs swifte: or like the wallowing
waters, tumbling and roulinge, one straight after the other, never stayinge
till they beat on the Beache, or hit against the hard Rocks: Or like a great
flock of sheep runninge through a narrow Lane, or passinge forth of some
gate, so fast as some run bie, others are in their places: so fared his
fancies, and so wauered they: so ran they forward, and so never stayed they
long upon one point: but by how much the more his senses were elevated with
these contrary cogitations, by so much the more was the tediousnes of that
toyling travail shortened: swimming thus as well in the waves of his will, as
in the waters of his wishes: in the floudes of his conceived felicity, as in
the Sea of security, and in the affections of his fancies, as in his shakinge
Ship: he espied at length the shore of his safegarde, and the Haven of his
happiness: the Port of his pride, and the arriuinge place of his rest: Now
he beheld Vienna at the full, and discerned the sight of the whole Town:
then lookinge on his vile apparel, and his torn rags: the uncleanness of
his clothes, and the filthiness of his face: the change of his countenance,
and the complexion conceived of his ill diet: knew not whether to go presently
into the town or stay till the shadowie night approached: or if he should so
go to his Unckles house, to put a Uisour before his face: if he should not
find his Uncle at home, to make him known to the servants or not: if he
should make him self known, his Uncle not there, they would be sorrowful,
not knowing how to help him: and if not tell who he were, they would not
receive him beeinge so ragged a coult, and so like a roge: duringe the
counterbuffe of these cross cogitations, and abidinge the meetinge of these
flowing fancies, the Ship thrust to the shore, and came to the landinge place:
by this time the Sun had seduced him self to the inferior parts of the
earth, and clean out of their sight an hour before. Narbonus then treadinge
his steps on more firm ground, than not long before he could, came
directly to his Unckles house, where entering in, found the Tables covered, and
his Uncle ready to sit down, to whom he did his duetiful obedience, and used
such courtesy as he best thought.

Henricus stared earnestly on him, and looked long before he knew him: but
perceiuinge it to be his Nephew, and not any other man, embraced him so hard,
as if he should never have seen him again, saying:

Alas Narbonus, with tricklinge tears, and watery eyes, how hard has fortune
dealt with thee? and how favorable with me? how froward was thy fate? and
how luckye my lotte? how insatiable thy rigor? and how sure my safety: had I
been thy companion, or thy fellow partner, in this villaynous voyage, or borne
a part in thy perplexed perilles, my care had been the less, and my
consolation the greater: thy hap more fortunate, and my mind better satisfied:
thy dread without danger, and my perplexity without peril: whom had thou
for thy companion? or who was thy Cabin fellow? Alas are these pale cheeks,
and these whitely lips the face of my Nephew, and the favor of my beloved
Narbonus? how haste thou been tormented, and in what manner have thou been
tumbled? how pined, and how plagued? how weather beaten, and how belly
battred? how deprived of thy rest, and how beguiled in this bargayne? O
Narbonus, how happy is thy home, and how lucky thy own Land? how fortunate
here thy friends and how does Vienna swim in pleasure? they are troubled
neither with Summers shyninge, nor pinched with Winters blastinge. But are
these thy own Robes, or have thou borrowed them? What Arms give thou in this
Coat armor? or in what place hanges thy Sheelde? the Lion roaringe? or the
Tigre tearinge? the half Moon, or the white Bear? No, thou give the Nitte
nippinge, or the Louse rampinge: But O good God the mutabilitie of felicity,
and the uncertainty of this estate: the troublesome time of this paltry
Pilgrimage, and the vale of this Uanitie: the place of perplexity, and the
Mother of Misery: God has disposed to every thing life and living, and given
to all other creatures a restinge place: but man has no certainty of his
being, nor any time appointed where he shall always rest: he is borne here, and
nourished a thousand miles off, leading here his infancy and youth, and his
old age he knows not where or in what place: when a man presumes most upon
his good hap, then is he likeliest to fall: and when he thinks the steps
are trodden for him, then he soonest slippeth: when he thinks he sits in
Fortunes lap, then is death in his dish: never happy whilst he lineth, and
never hapless till he be borne: when he thinks the boisterous blastes are
blown over, the crooked Cliftes compass him about: and when he thinks at
danger is drowned in forgetfulness, then begin his meerest miseries: If the
Sun shine hot in winter, it beetokeneth foul weather, and when the Porpose
plays above water, it is some sign of rain: thou have tasted both bale, and
bliss: felicity, and unhappiness: and the sour, so well as the sweet: some
mishap is always ready at our doors, but favorable fortune is hard to find:
but I marvel how thy tender body could abide the bruntes which thy back has
borne: for could thy weak nature digest things of great difficulty, when not
well thou could carry the cross of a little inconstancy: few friends I think
thou foundst to further thy favor, and as few well willers to complain thy
calamity: no penny, no Pater noster, nor no money, no Mass: he that has
little, shall have nothing, but somewhat has some savor: I think thy fare
was the least, and thy misery the most: the less thou had in keepinge, the
more intolerable thy grief: O the shiftinge that thou sawe^t, but thou I
doubt could not scratch: the swearinge, but thou could not sweat: the
flattering, but thou could not feign: the dissemblinge, but thou could not
double: the stealinge but thou could not filche: and the brablinge, but thou
could not brawle: he that cannot steal in a Camp, must not live under a
Captain: and he that cannot play the knave in the Feeldes, must not live in
the wars: either steal, or sterue: if not catch, then beg: if not filche,
then hang.

O detestable life, and O corrupted liberty: spoiled by devouring cormorantes,
and loathed by the misdemeanour of unreasonable outrages: by murtheringe Mates,
and by quarellinge caytifes: by ryotous Rebels, and by villainous Vipers: I
speak not that the Wars are not necessary, for that I know (otherwise) we
should not enjoy our own: Kings must by that means be resolved to reason, and
Traitors and Tirants tamed and punished: yet the abuses are intolerable by
the Captains, and without reason of the Soldiers: But as the breathing out
of my bitter words is no remedy against their wicked life, so thou once
deprived of these outrageous roysters, shall never by my consent have any
parcel of their patrimony again. But I wast my words in vain, and move
thee with the remembrance of those things which grieve thee, such necessaries
as thou want shall be to morrow provided, and those things which are lacking
as speedily made ready as may be: mean while, I wish thee be as merry as
thou may, and assure thy self, that thy Uncle reioyseth not a little thy
safe return.

Dear Uncle replied Narbonus, my travels have bin troublesome, and my ways
weerie: my iourneys great, and my profit small: my labor loathsome, and my
toil unrequited: the hazard of my life often in danger, and the fruition of my
health void of all hope: my young years are made to bear adversity, and
your gravity and goodness to give me good counsel: My youth replete with
sorrow, and my days filled with unhappiness, being strong and stout, may
better abide bitter bruntes, and endure sharp shoures: Your antientnesse
weakened with former factions, and tasting the tediousness of toils, is now
forced to content your self quietly, regarding not the novelties that daily
ensue, the hazarding of my life, with loss of friends and liberty, will be
the cause of my happiness, and more certain felicity. The greatest charge of
a Soldier is careful, and the lesser lives lamentable: when the best are
unprofitable, can the worst be tolerable? when the best are gall, must not the
worst be garlike? when the best are devilish, must not the worst be hellishe:
Here Rigor rules, and Reason runs away: faith flies, and fidelity is
forgotten: Justice is no Judge, and honesty has no portion in this place:
mercy is not mainteyned, and love is little regarded: The robbing, and the
rifling: the stealing, and the staruing: the killing, and the cutting: the
slasshing, and the bitter blows: the biting blastes, and the sharp showers:
the pitiful playntes, and the grievous gronings: the infected filthiness, and
the pestilent plagues: the dreadful deaths, and the terrible torments, would
mollify the strongest eyes to shead bitter tears, and make the most unkind
conscience to yield some succor: For my part I can brag with the least of my
beatitude, and boast with the best of my bitter braules: vaunt with the least
of my felicity, and crake with the most of my discourtesie: least luckie
amongst the living souls, and my death as detestable, had I then raked up my
bones: who lost all had no warrantise to get any more: and I lost no less yt
makes me so poor, as naked as my nail, and as lean as Lazararus, as poor as
Job, and as many faces as a Sheep: As for my man, he by this time has tried
his fortune, and proved his felicity: sick I left him, and who should seek,
dead should find him: when I lost my apparel, then lost I also him: my money
was too heavy carriage, and he too stately to awaite on my poor personage.

To show you the monstrousness of the Wars, and the nobleness of that
Army, the success was most happy, and our Souldioures escaped well.

To speak of the company of footmen, and the great assayes, the battery, and
the blows, the beseegings, and the breaches, the soucing shot, and the
piercing pikes: the courage of our Captains, and the discomfiture of our
Enemies, the time would seem too tedious, and the labor too loathsome: but
at any time hereafter, when it shall please you, command me to demonstrate, I
shall most dutifully do your desires, and most obedientlye fulfill your
requests: but be you assured, that I never mean to serve more, and my own
Country excepted, I have killed a Soldier.

Then sat they down to Supper, but his appetite was small, and his desire to
eat, less: yet he strayned no courtesy, and would not seem curious, yet
sat, though smallie to his ease, and eat, though little to his lust.

After Supper, he bid goodnight to his Uncle, and got him to his bed,
which he thought was the softest that ever he laid his limbs in, and the
pleasantest that ever he came in: there he rouled, and there he tossed: there
he tumbled, and there he wallowed: sometimes he laughed to himself, for joy
of his safe return, and then again he lamented, to think of his losses:
then was he merry that his Uncle was so glad of his coming home, and then
was he sorrowful to think how pitifully his Uncle complained his calamity:
then was he pleasantly disposed, to think of the renning his freendship with
his ancient companions, then contrary troubled, lest those whom he best
loved should fly the field and forsake him.

The contrariety of cogitations were like as when two Floudes meet, or the
diversity of his imaginations like the ebbing and flowing of the Seas.

I think Anthony at his return to Room was not better content to enjoy his
forepassed pleasures, than was Narbonus to possess his quiet Country, and
courteous companyons. And Aeneas not more glad, when he had escaped from the
slaughter of Troy, then he contented in crossing the Seas, and leaving the
place of his poverty. Caesar not more rejoiced of his triumphs after his
travel, nor Ulysses better content to come to his own home, then he
desirous of the place he now possessed, or joyful of his good hap for
coming so well: and I think Narbonus would choose to be a prentise in Vienna,
before a Prince of Spain: though he were troubled with his sickness, and the
change of his diet had altered his favor, yet could he not sleep in his
bed, for the joys he conceived, nor rest that night, for comforting
himself with his safe return: but within four or five days after, with
keeping good diet, and using good order, he retained his former favor, and
gained his ancient complexion, determined therefore to spend that day in
visiting his friend Phemocles, and in renewing of his old acquaintance: then
went he to his Fathers house, and enquired of him for his son, but he
answered that he was gone into Spain two months sithence, and he was not
certain of his return: Narbonus yielded him thanks for his courtesy, and so
departed home again. The inward joy he conceived belike of his safe arrival,
or pricked with some imaginations to forget their fidelity forepassed, but
this is most certain: his desire toward Phemocles was nothing so ^eepe as
before, nor his love to Fidelia nothing so great as before his going: Afterward
desirous to speak with Fidelia, or by some meane^ to use some conference with
her, yet fearful to be mistrusted, or to have any suspicion grow, as well for
his own honesty, as for her credit, shortly after he went to the Church,
and there thought to meet with her, thinking that she, who of late was so
devout a Votarie, was still so sainctly a seruitour: and she that of late was
sworn the Servant of Venus, was not now one of the Virgins Vestall: she that
but late was the only joy of Narbonus, was yet his faithful friend, and pressed
at his commandment.

There he sat all the time of service, and watched the devotion of his
Saint, but he gained as much sight of her, as if he had bin out of the
Church: for her deuoutenesse that day was nothing, and she came not to the
place of Prayer at all: thus he returned home so wise as he was before,
though not so well contented as he thought to be. Not long after, his Uncle
made a great Feast, and invited all his neighbors about him, and least
Fidelia should be there lacking, Narbonus would take the pains to bid her
himself: to the accomplishmente whereof, for that there was none so fit as him
self, he was content to take that office upon him, and his Uncle willingly
condiscended it should be so: At the appointed day, he invited first one, and
then an other: then went he to the Father of Fidelia, uncertain what to do,
whither to bid her Father and her both, or but him alone: if but him alone,
then he doubted she should not come: or to say first him self, and then her:
or after his speaking to him, to request her himself: then thinkinge so she
might lawfully frame some excuse: then be thought to desire him, and he
should speak to his Daughter: But in fine, goinge boldly, and having rejected
all fear, he went into the house, where he found one of his men, who
askinge for his Master, the Servant answered he was in his Chamber: then he
requested the Servant that he might speak with his Master from Henricus:
the man went and certified his Master thereof, who came presently to him, and
embraced Narbouus ioifully, to see him so safely returned: he questioned with
him of many matters, touching the estate of the Wars, and asked him of many
things in his travail: who answered him directly to his demands, and
resolved him in every thing that was asked. Then said Narbonus.

Sir so it is, my Uncle has invited certain of his Neighbors and friends,
and your household for one amongst the rest: pleases you therefore to accompany
that honest crew, your coming shall be very grateful, though your
entertainment ^ee but simple.

He thanked Henricus for his great courtesy, and promised to fulfill his
lawful request.

Narbonus departed, not so well satisfied as he would have wished, yet better
pleased then he imagined he should have bin: but amongst other matters, he
marvelled he could not see his Saint he served, but yet arminge him self
with the help of hope, he departed home driving out one nail with another
co^ceyte, deprived of despair, and certified of safety: Then declared he to
his Uncle, at the appointed day, they would all accomplish his desires: mean
while he fed upon felicity, and chewed naught but his own conceytes, yet his
drugges were not so hard to digest as before his voyage, nor his Pills so
perilous but that he could put them over without danger of death.

The desired day now come, and the time that Narbonus long expected, now
expired, the appointed guestes approached, first one, and after another: in the
end came the Father of Fidelia, and then she her self: but had she known
Narbonus to been so near her, she would have strayned courtesy, and stayed
still at home.

Henricus courteously welcomed first her Father and then her self.

Then Narbonus in the best manner he could, welcomed the Father, and coming
to her, his eyes bewrayed the secrecye of his thought, and his lips stayed so
long upon her cheeks, as the company might imagined him to be dumb: then
holding her fast by the fair fist, he spoke as follows.

And you Gentlewoman, better welcome then Gold, and more lyked of me, then
all the precious things in Germany: Let not your travail therefore seem
troublesome, nor your journey grievous, for the one shall be requited with
courtesy, and the other gratified with good will: which pleases you to accept
patiently, shall be surrendered bountifully.

Her replye he would not stay, fearinge beeinge suspected of the company, then
sat they all down to Dinner, and fed on such fare as there was provided:
Narbonus glutted him self with the sweet sight of his seemly Saint, always
feedinge on her amorous eyes, but Fidelia fed on disdain, and could eat no
meat till she had eased her stomach to Narbonus: Then beholding the great
cheer, and seeinge the sumptuous fare, he was not unmindful of his late
feasts, and could not forget those dainty dishes.

Dinner ended, the company disposed them selves to sundry actions, and diverse
pastimes: the elder company to questions touching their estate: and the
younger to more pleasant sportes, and always as one waxed stale, they renewed
it with some other more fresh.

Narbonus espying Fidelia without any to talk withal, and leaning at a Window,
began thus to assail her, and spoke as follows.

Mistress Fidelia, Ulysses after the long time of absence, and the sharp
showers he endured, returned to his well-beloved Penelope, and inioyed her at
length, whose second meetinge was as acceptable, as their first marriage: The
Daughter of Iepthath had such an inward desire to have the first sight of her
Father, as it cost her the best blood in her belly: and Tullie was more
joyfully received into Rome after the death of Scilla, then in all his life time
before: and Narbonus having gained the sweet sight of his faithful Fidelia,
is now content to offer him self sacrifise, to pleasure his beloved
Mistress: the time of my absence has been tedious, and my toylinge journey
not without danger, the greater my grief, and the harder my hap: often at
the bitter brincke of my gapinge Grave, but now safely returned, eased of my
pensiveness, and attayninge the type of my former felicity, surrenderinge my
self to the curiousness of your courtesy, and offeringe my self slave to
the bravery of your beauty, which I offer, not part, but all, into your
heavenly hands, the helper of my happiness, and the redeemer of my fore lost
liberty: Whereof being deprived, my life shall not long last, nor my days
any time endure: But as my contagious cares could not be counted, nor my
miseries manifested: my dyinge deaths, and yet living. In like case, can now
my heavenly graces be shown, or my earthly pleasures manifested, gayninge your
goodness, and having your happiness? Can the foul fly, her feathers plucked
away, and her flickering wings left naked and bare, does she not presently
fall to the earth, and so pine away? The sorry sheep deprived of her flouncinge
fleece, is subject to the scorchinge of the Sun, and the bitinge of flies,
seeking the shades, and couetinge the couertes, till the weighty wool have
covered her bare back, and her fleece grown in such order as before. The true
Turtle having lost the company of her Mate, mourns till she die, and never
enjoys any thing. Liuia sooner gained Anthony his pardon, then all the rest
of the Romans could: and Fidelia has woonne Narbonus to love her, which
before could not be persuaded to like any: and is he not tied to the faith of
Fidelia, and pressed to die a thousand deaths to pleasure his sweet Mistress?
Pleases you therefore to tarry no more times, nor to drive of no more days: to
bid no more bargaynes, nor to look for no other intreatinges but to end this
tractable Tragedy, and finish the fulness of our felicity, by protesting before
God and answering before the patient audience our ancient amity, by joining
of hands, and uniting of two several souls in one body, and the Church rites
used, as the order is: Pleases you therefore to will the time, and appoint the
place, I shall be pressed at your command, and obedient to do as you shall
like: As for my speedy departure, and the posting of my journey, I was hasted
by a Harbinger that would not stay a time, and moved by such a messenger that
would not awayte my leisure: forced therefore frowardly to abandon your
beauty, and hasted to fly your favorable face, which had I made denial, my
penalty should have been paid to my preiudicialitie, and my punishment more
grievous then gaynefull: my love would have lost the lyking of my loyalty, and
my liberty would have cost me my life: Had I come to taken my freendly
farewell, and as duty would, to have known your pleasure: the sighs and the
sobbes, the tears and the kisses: the farewels, and the partings, would have
bin so unpleasant, and the mutabilitie so hard to digest: the last adue so
lamentable, and my bewaylings more bountiful, than were the sorrows of
Orpheus, leesing his Wife again after he had recovered her out of Hell. In
deed I confess every blotte is a fault, and every hole blame worthy.
Offensive I was in departing, and guilty in going without license, for the
which my misdemeanour, and voluntary presumption, I stand bound at the bar
of your beauty, and appeal to your favorable courtesy, and if therein I did
offend willingly, I crave pardon earnestly: I stay your favorable answer,
and the pronouncing of your penalty.

Small penalty Sir replied she, but such as it is has bin long sithence
pronounced, and it is neither better nor worse, but that from henceforth you
never offer to move one motion of such matter, nor follow the pursuit of this
your frustrate purpose any farther: you know Narbonus, the Eyas Hawk is soon
reclaymed, but if she be not fed, she will quickly away: the Colte being
well handled, will be made to the Saddle, but use him not well, and he will
have the trick of a jade: the brick must be first made before the house be
built: and the Taylour must have his cloth, before he fashion the garmente:
the Shomaker must have his leather, before he can fashion his lachet: and the
Apothecarie his confections, before he make his drugges: you reckon without
your hosts, therefore you are like to pay dear for your pennyworth: you fish
before the net, and you have found a Frogge: you shot your shaft before you
set your mark, therefore you were best to level again: Does not the Sun
make the grass grow? and does it not also dry up the water? the rain
breaks the sprouting ears of Corn, yet makes the Beeche fresh and green:
does not the running River soften the dirt, and harden the pitch? has the
sight of my beauty so infected you, that your senses are seduced out of your
own custody? The restreyning of your courtesy shall therefore henceforth be
kept so close, as you shall not find one eye to look upon me vaynely: He that
should taste the courtesy of so quick a caruer, should arise from Dinner so
hungry as he sat down: and she that should trust your talk so full of
toys, should make a long harvest of a few thistles. The running River never
returns nor flows as the walowing Sea, the Western wind retireth not to
the place from whence it came: and the Rain and Snow go not back into the
Skies again: If in this I have spoken, I turn my cappe, or alter my mind,
count my words never to be worth credit, and my deeds to deserve double
infamy. Though I were as hot as Aetna, yet now am I as cold as Cacasus: and
though I blazed like a hauin, yet now I lie smothering like wette straw: if at
the first so h^te as a tossed, yet now so cold as a stone, and never so hot in
love, but now as cold in desire. There are I know in Spain proper pieces, and
pretty paragons: dainty Damsels, and trim trulles, more fit for your
feeding, and more dainty for your diet: more lovely to look on, and more
handsome in behavior: more dainty in their dealings, and more faithful in
their fancies: more beautiful in favor, and more loyal in heart: This
journey you framed of a set purpose, and think to blind my eyes with a bald
excuse: but you halt before a criple, and limp before a lame body: you a
fleeter, and I faithful: shall you gain my love, and shall I lose my
liberty? nay, you shall first be deceived of your hope, and I deprived of a
flatterer: you a flincher and flytouch, and I steel to the hard back: you
under pretense of love think to lure me to your lust, I in safegarde of my
honesty discharge you of such lustly loyalty: But you have missed the
cushion, and sit on the bare bench, I frustrated of a faithless friend, and
discharged of a rank Rebel: you set your honesty to sale, but I sell not
my maydenhead in shoppes: you a shifter, in deceyuing so simple maids as my
self, and I of no honest behavior, to retain so trustlesse a treacher: your
perfumed fancies, and wanton words, shall not reclayme me to your call, but my
courtesy, not exceeding the bands of honesty, have not made you a warrant to
win me to your will: You can prate like a Parrat, and flatter like
Aristippus: the one shall not infect me, nor the other overcome me: He that
will leave his wife, to find a louse in another Country, shall never be my
faithful freende, though I be his faithless foe. In deed Sir, it is a
cowardly part to tarry at home where you should win credit: and I were a
careless trull to match with such a mate, as when he can find no other, would
then pray upon me, but you are beside the saddle, and have missed your mark:
Think you in this long time of your absence, I am to seek of a husband? no,
trust me, another has won me by wisdom, and he shall wear me by wit. You
lost me by leaving your loyalty, and I forsake you, not forcing your
flattery. If my sight at your departure should have dangered your disease, my
company at your return shall not infect your fancy. You are a good Soldier,
and the stragglers you know come often short home: Because therefore you have
wandered so wide, let some other take you up for stumbling, and set you at sale,
that would sell others honesty: No, Jason was a false fleeter, and Aeneas a
lewd lover: the one tarried a time, and then returned: afterward went, and
never came again: the others villainous pretense once gotten, fled, and never
looked behind him: These both Princes, they both Pirates: these both lovers,
they both Traitors: these two Ladies lost their lives with love: they both
laughed in their sleeves once having gained their lust. He that would not
tarry at home to wear me, shall not now he is come home win me to wed me. But
why do I make a long season about a few Grapes? and when they are gathered,
they will prove but rotten: Know this therefore Narbonus that as you had me,
so shall you never have me: and as you woonne me, so have I lost you: I was not
so soon caught, but I am as quickly gone: When you had won me, you should
then have worn me, but now you have lost me: I am not for your liking, my
answer is therefore, that you keep your tongue still in your mouth, and wast
not your words in vain: To tell you who shall enjoy me, you were never the
wiser, and I little the better: but assure your self, whosoever do wear me,
shall first wedde me, and he that has wedded me, shall then wear me at his
pleasure: as for your self, I give you for ever the Basalos manos: therefore
never tempt me with wanton words, nor alure me with paltrie promises, if you
do, I will make you no answer, or if you move me never so much, I will keep
still my tongue, and not open my mouth.

Narbonus was nipped in the head like a Cock^sparow, and grieved at the gall,
neither knew he how to look, nor what to answer, but at last thinking to give
her as faithless a farewell, as she gave him a grievous gratulation, he framed
himself to speak, and replied as follows.

I see Fidelia, that it is no fable, and not so common as true, that a woman's
good will endures but a wincking, and her love lasts but the lighting of a
Candle: to know the cause of this suedaine breach, and to understand the
meaning of your flying so fickly away, would do me little ease, and less
pleasure. And has my absence procured so your perplexity? and could you not
stay my return? because I went, therefore was I faithles^e: and had I stayed at
home, should I not bin as hapless? thou say my going was to gain some
girl so honest as thy self, no, thou know I was forced to go, and in
going, I lost my liberty at home, and in not being at home, I lost thy liking,
and have gained thy ill will, a great jewel surely, and a peerless piece, a
painted sheath, or an Appothecaries pot, better lost tha^ found, and better
forsaken tha^ followed, for who finds thee, shall find a flirter, and who
inioyes thee, I wish him no greater plague. Am I as false as Jason? nay, art
thou not as light as Lays? am I Appius to spoil thee of thy virginity? nay,
art not thou Flora that will bid all welcome? am I Clodius that went in woman's
apparel, to deprive Pompey of he^ honesty? nay, art not thou Medalia that
would hold up, thou carest not to whom? am I Eneas that gained his pleasure,
and then went his way? and art not thou so bad as runnagate Atlante, that lost
the lives of so many Nobles? in deed Lucretia dyed, her honesty once lost: and
Virginia would rather lose her life, then forgo that jewel her virginity: but
thou that live in lust, will never die of love: thou may well frye
against the fire, but thou will never be burnt with the flame: were thy case
like to Lucretia, thou would not refuse so gentle an offer, to take so
shameful a death: and werte thou Phillis, thou would see ten husbands
hanged, before thou would die thy self: In deed I won the thee with an
Apple, and shall leese thee with a Nutte: was thou of late so hot as Oil, and
now so cold as Iron: thou in love over the shoes, and now in hate over the
Boots: thou cloakest thy collusion under the pretense of my absence, and
could thou not stayed one year, thou would ill have stayed ten? When every
one does like thee, some one shall wed thee: God give him good, but his hair
is like to grow out at his hoode: such fair faces, and such froward fancies:
such loving looks, and such lustly desires: such fair words and such false
farewels: such wanton eyes, and such dissembling deeds: such a heavenly heart,
and such a devilish imagination: thou have Honey in thy mouth, and a stinge in
thy tail: thy words are Sugar, but thy deeds sauce: a painted Pot, with
poisoned Pottage: thou that wast drowned in despair, art now drenched in
disdain: has my loyal likinge, procured me so louelesse a Lady? and my
flaming fire, turned to so cold a corosiue? thou wishest me not to know the
cause of this thy departure. In deed the knowledge will do me small
pleasure, and the remembrance less for my advantage: he that has so
faithful a friend, were better have some faythlesse foe: Fidelia is faithful
by interpretation, but thou faithless in thy imagination: thou banishest me
the presence of thy face, and I command thee to avoid my faith: Thou put
me out of pay, and never more to crave thy company: I put thee out of my
passion, and will thee never to expect of me any felicity: Thou wishest me
never to move one word more whatsoever, and I put thee out of my Memento, and
give over that which so earnestly I I did persevere: Thou say I waste my
words in vain and tear my time in travail, where there is no gain: I end
therefore to speak more to Fidelia, once thy faithful friend, but now thy
sworn enemy: once pressed to pleasure thee, now determined to hate thee: once
thy terestriall trust, now thy earthly trouble: Yet to quarrel with a woman,
or to fight with a shadow: if I gain the conquest I leese my credit, and if I
win the feeld, I shall go home without victory: Therefore, for ever I forsake
thee, and bid the everlastingly adieu, wishing thee to be more loyal to him,
then faithful to me: more constant for thy own credit, then trusty to me
for thy own honesty: and as thou have given me a grievous gratulation, so
give I thee a faithless farewell.

Then Narbonus returned to the Gentlemen, and Fidelia sat down amongst the
Gentlewomen: thus passed they the time, till night made them part company:
After they were all departed, and had yielded thanks to Henricus, Narbonus
entered into the inner part of his cogitations, and to the secret thoughts of
his mind, which he found so contrary, as he knew not on whether to take
hold: The Supper ended, he departed to his bed, where laid, he used these
words to himself.

O good God, when thou first made Man, thou also framedst a Woman out of his
flesh, to be a helper in his tedious warfare, and a partaker in his toyling
travail: a helper, nay rather a plague: for was not her mind straight moved
to mischief, and her wanton will, quickly woonne to procure his fall? and by
nature I think all Women are subject to that same infection, and follow the
Line of their first leader: how little time does their love and loyalty last?
and how small const^ncy, has their greatest time of felicity? how loose of
their loyalty* and how lavish of their liberty? who will credit the glo^singes
of a Woman? and who will believe their fair faces? their flatteringe features,
with devilish devises? their sweet words, with Sirenes Songs? their
mutabilitie, and their inconstancy? lost thou have Fidelia* and forsaken
Phemocles.

O Phemocles, to enjoy thy company I forsake all the faithless women in the
world: But con^emne not all, Narbonus, though some be false: thou know
Lucretia was so chaste, that it lost her this life: and Susanna chose rather to
yield to the fury of death, then consent to wicked lust: Dianira slew her
self, and Hero dr^wned he^ self: Virginia was content to be executed of her
Father, and the Daughter of Iepthath, to fulfill her Fathers promise, was
sacrifised: But Fidelia, her liking was the greatest that might proceed from
any woman, and now her disloyalty comparable with the most faythlesse that ever
breathed: so soon entised to love, and so quickly content to bestow her life
on my loialtie and now so hastily willing to work my woe by hate. In deed
the ^oylinge Lead^ will be no hoater then fair Water, and the red h^ate
Iron so cold as a stone: and her love so hot as fire, is now so cold as Ice:
But who could imagine that under so fair a face could lie so foul a fancy?
and that so sweet a tongue, would stinge worse then a Serpente? that under
such painted Clothes, could be such ragged Walls? and that so beautiful a
body could nourish^ so bitter blood: But who has not tasted this that I feel?
or who has not been stunge? if I am bitte^, if I am in the briars, who has
not been in the bushes, and if I were taken, who has not been caught? did
not Hercules wife send him a poisoned shirte? which no sooner on, but it
stick fast to his back, and ever as he would have plucked it away, it tore
the flesh with it, and never came off, till he yielded to death? Did not
Iesabell cause her husband to be hated of the Lord, and his blood to be
given to Dogs for her wicked lust? Did not the wives of the wisest Prince
that ever was in the world cause him forsake his gracious God, to follow their
wicked lusts: and did not the wife of Iobe, wish him to curse God and dye.

O how insatiable are their ways, and how wanton their works? how
dissemblinge their deeds, and how false their faythes? how lyinge their
lips, and how cont^^^y their vile motions? and let a man go to the ground of
his imagination, and to their perfect substance, what are they of their
selves? and how much inferior to us? they cannot live without our companyes,
nor do any thing without our helps: and what is that in them that we so
greedily gape after? and what the cause that we so desire their companies?
their beauty reserved, and a little favor in their face: All Women are alike,
and every one has so much as the other: and yet a great number their faces but
borrowed, and their favors painted with paltry: but take that away, they are
worse favored then we, and more loathsome in every respect: worse shaped,
and worse complexions: worse limmed, and worse legged: their condition is more
vile, and their state more filthy: is not all that is in them their face? and
al their other graces the foot and the hand? was not man first made? and is
not his substance so much the purer? is not she weak of nature? why the^
should she be preferred before him? is she not more vile of condition? why
the^ should she be his coequal? is not her birth baser? why should her calling
be before his? but she being inferior desires superiority, and would
willingly have the souerainty: yet in that she is weakest of nature, and more
vile of condition, man is content to yield, rather then gain so simple a
conquest: ^^ take away their Ruff^s, and they look (...), and they are ^^^ple
to behold: (...) of and they look crabbe^^^ their heair untrust, and they look
(...) They (...) forsoothe have their Ringes, and their Bracelets: their
Bu^graces, and their Squares: their Hoods, and their Caps: their Iuelles, and
their knackes: but take all these from them, and turn them like a man into a
single Coat, and they look like a new shorn sheep, or like a F^wle plucked
(...) of her feathers: and what does a man lose in purchasing their
displeasure? nay, what does a man gain in getting their favor? a few wanton
kysses, or a bundle of paltrie imbracinges, which pass like the wind* and
fade like a shadow: and if happily a man possess their honesty, that goodly
Iuell: what a feeld he has fought, and what a Treasure he has gained, what a
conquest he has made, and what a kingdom he has obtained, when he has done
what he ran, and gained all he could desire, he goes away sorrowful, and
thincketh him self a fool for his labor. For if he loved her, he repents
he defiled her, and were it to do again, he would never put it in practice:
if he did it for de^^re, and she not beautiful; then he calls himself beast,
to deal with her that he loatheth to look on: Did not God ordain them to be
a plague unto us, and a necessary evil? what are they better, or what do they
get? what do they gain, or what do they save? nay, what do they not spend,
or what do they not consume away? painful to please, and peeuishly disposed
all things that lyketh not them is naught, and if never so bad, lyking their
lust it is excellent. Was not David best beloved of God, and a mighty Prince?
yet for a Woman, a manslayer, and purchased the displeasure of his God? Was not
Solomon the wisest, and was not he the ritchest? yet entyced to the toys of
Women, and fled the favor of his God (to gain the glory of his beuty?) And
was not Simpson the strongest? for every lock was the strength of another man:
Women deprived him of his strength, and made him their laughing stock: before,
more strong then a Horse: now, ridden like an Ass: he must needs confess his
strength, and paid his life for his folly: those three the mightiest of the
world, these three most miserable by Women: Was not that noble City of Troy,
sacked for a strumpette: and when it had cost so many lives, they gained but a
harlotte, he that speedeth best, can not brag of his bravery: and he that is
best beloved, not boast of his felicity: the clearest River has dyrt in the
b^^tome: and the fairest Woman, some filthynesse within her: when their painted
clothes are away, they are (...) ragged walls: The best blown Tree, has
some blossom blasted: and the beautifullest body, has some blemish in her
demeanor: The Lepard is spotted by nature, and a Woman is stay^ed by kind.
Like as a Tree grafted with sundry fruit upon one root: so is a Woman's mind
set with s^^drie conditions. Their dealinges so dangerous, and their deeds so
detestable: their minds so mutable, and their hearts so doubtful: as when a
Man thinks he has the Foul in his fyst, he has but the feathers: and when a
man thinks he has the honey Comb, he has the Be by the tail: in deed
they may well be ralled a necessary evil, for that they are out of conceyt with
any goodness: they are as cunning in the art of flattery, as if they had been
bound prentise to the occupation: to speak the fairest words that may be, and
to perform their deeds, they care not how stenderlie: to profess the
greatest freendship, and use such enticing terms, as if a man should live by
their loyalty, and (...) no other food but their fancies: but when it comes
to the trial, rank rebels, and excellent dyssemblers: but to punish them,
or to plague them, to torment them, or for a man to pay them as they deserve, a
man gayneth but reproach for his pain, and gets but a miserable martyrdom,
for so careless a conquest: and we are content this shall (...) for their
privilege, and so they shall be excused: they are the weaker vessels, and
therefore their nature to be borne with all: But ought not they rather being
weaker, to bear with us? and to use submission to their superiors, when their
felicity depends upon our safety? Did not Sara call her Husband Lord? and
did not Rebecca, obey in what she was commanded? did not Octauius ^^^ter,
gain Anthony his pardon, with the dutiful reverence she used to her Brother?
and did not Brisoida win the heart of Achilles, with her modest grace? was not
Susanna consent to creep to her Husband? and was not the wife of D^^^trius
content to ran Lackey like, by her husband? What a number of noble Matrones,
whose life depended upon the courtesy of their Husbands: But ou^ Damselles:
must rule the sovereign sway, and bear away the bel^es themselves. Did not
noble Achilles, consume away amongst those Damsels? and that Giaunt
Panthemophe, who had Bears waiting on him like Dogs, and could make subject
any wild Beast: but yet a wanton Woman, he (...) turn to his will: that great
Captain Holofer^es* whose sight made his enemy to quake, lost his life to
wy^ his lust, and was slain by a Woman: and did not Herodias ^unce before
Herod, to have the head of that godly man Iohnand (...) commit they any
offense whatsoever, and let them (...) thing blame worthy, their answer is
ready at their aperne string^: and no sooner look on a Man, but some excuse
they have ready: but if they want any thing worthy lyking, or need the help of
a man any way, then they flatter, and the^ they gloss, then they prate, and
then they make suit, then speak they fair, and then use the sweetest words
that may be: but the thing once obtained they sue for, and that their desire
gained, they look so big, and speak so scornfully, answer so stately, and
deny so daintely, they will cover their craft so cunningly, and hyde their hate
so privily, that a man would imagine, they would never seek help again, nor
crave comfort any way whatsoever: hope of a man's happiness, and depend upon
his pleasure: stand to cortesie, or yield to curiosity. One vaunteth, of the
beauty of such a body, an other braggeth of the bravery of such a Maiden:
one vaunteth of the wearing of the apparel of such a Damsel: and an other
braggeth, that the attire of such a ones head, is surpassing, and all forsoothe
to have them placed first them selves, and that others should commend their
beauties: thus they all seek for superiority, bu^ none (...) for minority.
The great Elephant is in time reclaymed and made ientle, and the Lion knows
his keeper: the Bear knows his Master, and the Ox his feeder. But when
will a Woman be subject to a man, or yield to him in matters of reason? but let
a man go to the ground of their nature, and search the depth of their (...),
and no doubt, that Woman whose conditions are most ex^e^lent, has some fault,
and ^he who is most clea^e, has some blemish: the Triacle does as well hurt,
as drive o^^ poison: too much Wine does make the brain senceles, but two
cups do sharpen the wit: the goodness of the one should be p^^serued
before the vileness of the other, and the well using of any thing, is that
only which ought to be embraced. If thy choice be made of a wife, and that thou
frame thy self in wedlock* to lead the remaynder of thy life: the fairest,
or the best condicioned, the rytchest thou would desire, or such a one as is
beutifyed with the gifts of nature. Alas thou have gotten but a small
purchase, and won but a small value: for if she be fair, art thou not
fearful some other will like her? if merry and pleasauntly disposed, then art
thou infected with Ielosie, and think every one the laugheth upon, she
lusts after: if sober, then is she fullen, and thou regarde^^ not her
company: is brave in her apparel, then is she proud: if but clea^ly, then is
she sluttish: If she can talk well, then is she a prating Parrat: and if she
answer not every foolish question, then is she a dotarde and a meacocke: If
fruitful and bear thee children, thy care is increased: if barren, thy
sorrow augmented: if a good huswife, and look well about her business then
is she a cribbe and a shrew: if she set her servant about that which she
might do her self, then is she a fine Dame and will not foil her fingers: If
a good house keeper, then will she undo her Husband: if hard in her house,
then she leeseth his credit: Every way thy sorrow is increased, and
whatsoever she be, thy care grows greater: when the best is sour, can the
worst be sauorie? the number is so small of good women, and the company so
great of wicked, that often, blind bayarde has a good bargayne, and a right
honest man beguyled with a shrewish slutte. A days writing were too little to
reckon up their dealinges, and thy travail would not requite thy pain: was
not that beast Pasiphae enamored of a Bull? and Cia^a gotten with child of her
Father, Biblis in love with her Brother: and Helen (who had the name for
beutie) yet caused many to loose their lives. But the^ they will answer that a
great number have been beguyled by the crafts of men, and deceived by their
collusion: but I speak not of all good Women, neither am I so foolish to call
their names in question, whose virtues yet shine as bright, as if they lived
and whose fame shall never dye: But were Dido now to dye, I doubt she would
not be so hasty to slay her self: and I trust had Lucretia been favorably
entreated, she would in time have yielded more quietly, though then, it cost
her ye best blood in her belly: Were Procris now to take her farewell, she
would be better advised, and Sophronia would be very ill bestead, before she
would commit that which she did: Therefore their fair faces may not flatter
thee to favor them, nor their loving looks entyce thee to try their
trumperies: nay, flatter not thy self in the imaginations of thy own mind,
but drive such doubts out of thy head: for, put these things once out of thy
Memento, and thou wylt think to gain that which thou hopest for before, and
to obtain that which is quite out of thy reach, yet think but thus with thy
self, she regards not me: why then should I like her, and she loves me not?
why then should I not loath her? I care not for her, and I regard her not: she
shall be blotted out of my book, and be cast for ever out of my thought. But
happily thou will think, though at the first she seem strange, she will in
tune be reclaymed: and though now she be coy in aunswering, yet will she be
courteous and yield to my request: and though yet she seem dayntie, and make
denial, yet in time my trauaill may be tried to my felicity, and my pain
prove for my profit: For what will thou say, can be obtained without time? and
in time thou shall be farther of then at the first: in time thou shall hardly
get that ^^ that thy heart, which at the first, with ease thou might have
vomitted out of thy stomach: do thou not see that a little wound grows to
an incurable sore: and a drop of poison, runs quickly into all the beynes:
a little sprigge grows to a monstrous Dake: and a little bullet, will make a
great breach in the wall. Why then should thou flatter thy self, and leese
the flesh to find a shadow: when at the first, thou might have laid it
beside, or refused it like a morsel of meat, that lyketh not thy stomach:
first tomorrow, and then next day, driving of the time, will drive thee into
danger, and delays do never serve to any goodness: but flee thou them, and
they will follow thee: loathe them, and they will love thee: care not for them,
and they will crave thy company: shun them, and they will make suit after thee:
look not on them, and they will lust after thee: But thou must at every sight
of them, off with thy cappe, and kiss thy hand: thou can not see them
standing at the do^re, but needs must use some gratulation, some talk, or
some toys: then in the night to be under their window, with songs, or to use
some kind of Music: with somewhat thou must delight their foolish fancies:
and rather then fail, endight some loving letter: then will they plumbe upon
thee like a Hawk, and crow over thee like a Cock of the Game: then must thou
be sworn to their service, and wedded to their wills: not so much then, as a
look awry, or make a motion to laugh, unless to please their fancies, and to
feed their humors: ready at their beckes, and coming at their calls, at the
holding up of a King, or at the least mean that may be made, upon pain of
aleagaunce, or getting their displeasures: then must thou be lavish of thy
lyberalitie, and frank of thy free will, to give bountifully, and to spend
plentifully: Then will thy purse be so poor, that thou shall have small cause
to be proud: thou must furnish up their Iuell box, and arm them with
Bracelettes: royst them with Rings, and ruffle them with Ruffes: then must they
have Knives, and Gloves, Lawnes, and stockinges. Then must you discharge the
Mercers books, and pay the Habardashers man: bestow that Stone, and give that
Glass, care for no cost, and spare for no spending: And when thou have all
done, and given all they can demand, so ill rewarded for thy pains: or
perhaps row in an other man's boat. Or what are the best of them all,
without a man? or what is their filicity amongst them selves: like a Hog
without a head, and a Sheep without a Sheephearde, as a Horse without a
Master, and a Tree without a blossom, a Uine without Grapes, and a fair
feelde without any fruit. Ours is the care, and ours the travail: ours the
cost, and ours the charges, ours the labor, and yet ours the loss: ours the
pain, and yet theirs the gain. Are not these unprofitable servant, and
loytring Lozelles, deuowring Caterpillars, and the eaters up of our profit: we
must watch, and we must ward: we must fight, and we must defend: we till, and
we sow, we keep them: and all that we can do, too little to gain their good
wylles: and they in recompense, pay us two for one, more then we would, and
more then they with honesty should. O Narbonus, thou now braggest like a Cock
of the game: but when thou see the^, I fear me thou will be a crauen: but to
avoid that inconvenience, I will forsake them: and to prevent that danger, I
will not come into their companies: But in staying here, I must of force see
them: and I ca^ not abide in Vienna, but I must behold them: therefore I will
for a time into ye Country, and there remain till I have quite forgotten
the^: There may I hawke, and there may I hunt, there may I ride, and there may
I use any exercise: as for this love, I make it for ever a quittance, and seal
it with my heart and hand: for let me be busied with my books, or using other
matters, co^ferring with any of our affairs, or occupied with any business,
what soever any thing yt I do, so not id^ey disposed, love is never remembered,
nor such lust thought upon: loytring thus in my loathsome bed, my head is
intoxicated: and spending my time loytringly, I am troubled with such vain
imaginatio^s, the fancies flee before my face like swarms of Bees, and
cogitatio^s grow as thick as ye Snow falls: this lustly life shall therefore
be left, and so much as will sustain nature, I will allow my self, and no
sooner awaked, and that these thoughts begin to throng in my head, but forsake
my bed, and busy my self with my Books, and leave to flatter my self any
more, and cease to feed my mind with these vain hopes.

Then he thoroughly resolved him self, to use no other exercise but his
Books, and to make his study, the only place of his recreation: and seemed
very joyful that this his love was not known to any, nor manifested to the
dearest friends he had. But then he remembered himself, that to abide at home,
having never a freende to whom he might declare his cogitations, or make
copartener of his dooinges. As for the return of Phemocles it was uncertain,
and how long h^ would stay out, not known to him: and had he been at home, no
other friends he would have chosen for his companions. Then there assailed him
so many sundry devices, and such fresh assaults, to what he might betake him
self, or how he should spend the rest of his days: musing first on this
thing, then on that place: first on this study, then on that exercise: now on
this travail, and then on that staying at home: and the inward joy he
conceived, since his late Soldiers life: the misery he then sustained, and
the want and poverty he was in: waying with him self how he lived like a
servile slave, and now the pleasant life he sustained. All which made him
forget the love of Fidelia, and abolishe her clean out of his mind: then he
remembered being but young, and tarying at home, some company would use him
which he should not very well like, and also that he should that way displease
his Uncle: he therefore purposed to spend one year in the service of the Court,
which would be very profitable for him being well used: and upon this
determination he forsook his sluggish bed, and thought to break the matter
to his Uncle: which if it should dislike him, he would not persevere any
further in it. Not long after, he found his Uncle at so good leisure, as they
thoroughly debated of the matter between them. His Uncle seeing him so wylling
to please him, and so glad to obey, granted him his request, but lycenced him
but for one year: and thereupon procured him the service of a good noble
Gentleman in the Emperors Court, and such a one as he should not spend his
time without some profit: and thereupon furnished him with all necessaries, that
were wanting, and every thing (whatsoever) was needful: then Narbonus took
leave of his Uncle, and went once again to try his favorable Fortune.

PHemocles sailed with a soft sweet winde^ and arrived very well in Spain:
where no sooner set on (...), and that he had a little refreshed him self, but
he enquired which way the Camp lay, and in what part of the Country* which
was certified him to be very far off, and a long journey thither: But what
travail was to ^edious, or what way to wearisome? what journey to long, or what
passage to hard, to him that so earnestly desired the company of his freende:
and for whose sake, he would spare neither ryding nor running? He made great
haste* but never the better, and great speed, but prospered ill: thought long
till he came there, and yet for all his haste, he is arrived short: he spared
not his spurs, nor favored his Horse flesh: rode like a Royster, and doubted
no danger: all he thought to long that he was ryding, and yet as good never a
whit, as never the better. He that made such haste, could not be many days:
before he came to the Camp: though the mark were taken up before, that he
shot at: In the end he arrived at that place; for which he had posted so fast
for, and then enquired for his Captain after he had found him, he asked for a
Gentleman, his Souldior, named Narbonus: But his Captain made so small regard
of him when he was there, that he forgotte his departure: therefore answered,
he knew not where he was, nor what was become of him: then he espied some that
he had seen in Vienna, and such as he imagined knew him, of them he inquired,
if they knew not such a man? and one, as he thought that came in their
companies? Then they replied, they knew him very well, and were sorry for his
mishappe: then they told Phemocles, that he was either dead, or taken prisoner
by the Turk: Phemocles not content with this answer, nor fully persuaded with
their sayings, made farther search, and enquired to the uttermost he could: But
he prevailed as much, as if he should have asked of ye stones, or have sought
him in ye Sea: then in the end he persuaded himself, for yt no letters came
to him, nor no news by any other, yt either he was dead, or he should never
see him again: he then departed so sorrowful as his heart could hold, and so
lamented his loss, as if he would have died with him for company.

Who then had beheld the mourning of the Turtle, or the pining away without
comfort: or as the little Lamb weaned from me tente of her Dam, still cries,
and always co^playneth, till she have forgotten her Nurse, or blotted out the
remembrance of her mother: Or as when a man pulls a ilender ^^yp, from the
tender Tree, or cutteth away the rind in the Spring time, bleedeth a great
while after, and distylleth out tears, as it were, till ye bark have covered
ye place, or a new spring sprowted in ye stead: Or like the soft dropping
Su^mer showers, which hang upon the ^^^ber cares of Corn, wherewith they did
(...) their heavy headdes, and shake of the moist tears, till the shyning Sun
do eleuate them to their sonner state, and make them hold up their heads as
before: Or as the flowing floods, that over run the brinks of the banckes,
(...) amongst the gr^ene grass, and ouerwhelmeth the tender tops of the
g^owing Flegges, which make them hold down their heavy heads, and s^owpe to
the ground, which once sunk into the earth, or let out again any way, they
stand stalking up as at the first, and flourish as they did before: So fared it
with Phemocles, and so (...) he down his head: his heart throbbed within him,
and his moist eyes could not keep the tryckling tears from his cheeks: First
blaming his Uncle, and then con^empning his Captain, for having so little
regard of him: His face was changed with this his lamenting, and his cheeks
were pale and wan with blubbering, and weeping: in such order as a man might
have judged by his outward actions, his inward thoughts to be greatly moved,
and his tongue bewrayed him: for in speaking, he often answered contrary: the
small pleasure he conceived of this hasty voyage, and the little ease he
sustained, in this time of his travail, so perplexed him, and so changed his
nature, as every thing seemed to strive against his stomach, and every
medicine was contrary to his diet. Thus he romed up and down the Country a
certain space, to behold the order and pleasures thereof: but imagining that
he should be demanded of the estate of the Country, and what he had seen
there, worthy notice, thought he would view what he could see, and carry news
what he had learned* He therefore left never a good Town unseen, nor any place
of pleasure unmarked: Sometimes he beheld the goodly Uines growing along the
banks, of some running Rivers (most excellent to behold) and very good to
refresh his weary spirits: Then the goodly Lymon trees, that were so
effectually set, as if Dame nature her self had been ouerseeing the planter:
then the Pomegranats, which fruit was so pleasant to behold, and so fair in
sight, as he imagined were the Apples of Hesperia, or the fruit in Paradize:
then the green Oringes which hanged so long on the Trees, till the new
blossom came again: Then the fruitful Olives, which dropped down from the
Trees, he could hardly refrain his heart from desiring some of them, nor
willingly kept his fingers from plucking. Then might he behold the high
Pirenes, and have the view of those noble Hills, which seemed to him, as if
they touched the Sky, or held some part of the Heavens upon their shoulders:
then looking downwardes, he might behold the Rivers, and see those running
streams, the fairest (by report) in the world, and the clearest to look
upon: All which being viewed at full, and marked to the whole perfection,
yielding not only a sweet smell, but also the platte for profit, and
pleasure most excellent. These heavenly delyghts proceeding out of that earthly
Paradize, somewhat refreshed this wandering wayfarer, and made him be a little
more pleasantly disposed: And by this time yt he had gained, the full view of ye
Country, his limited time was near expired: he therefore hasted toward the
Sea, and stayed not long by the way, where he remained but a small time, but
that there was a Ship ready for him to sail toward his Country: and the
wind no sooner served for their expected purpose, but they wayed Ancor, and
hoysed up their sails: Phemocles had not long been on Shipboorde, nor sailed
many leagues, but he waxed very drowsy, and had a great desire to sleep,
insomuch as he could hardly keep his eyes from winking, or hold his head from
nodding: by reason whereof, he seemed offended with his own fancies, as if they
had pres^aged him some future mischeefes, not so good as he looked for, and
more then he had deserved: he therefore thinking, some thing would follow his
heaviness, and some Fortune worse then he expected ensue, yielded him self to
the lust of his desires, and laid him down to slumber in safety. Where he
had not lain long in this troublesome trance, nor spent (as he thought) above
two hours in sleeping, but he dreamed, and saw that sight, the strangeness
whereof made him to muse a little, and the rarenes of the matter, made him hope
well for a time. But then he remembered, that dreams were but fleeing fancies,
and who so trusted them, should be deceived: he thought therefore to let them
pass as they came, and to put them as lightly out of his mind, as they came
easily into his brain, and the effect was this: Already he thought him self
arrived at Vienna, and even at that time newly set on shore: where passing
along the Town, and going through the street, before he came to his Fathers,
the people stood so thick on both sides, as he marueyled what the meaning
should be, and preased always thick, and more in their places: him self as
desirous of novelties as any, and as well content to see some strange sight as
another, stood amongst the throng, and stayed with the company: at last he
saw at the farther end of the street, a great number of Priests, and a
rablement of Friars, a huge company of Munkes, and a merueylous many of the
laity, marching a long, and coming toward him: some with Tapers, and some
with Torches, some with Linkes, and some with lights, some with Candles, and
some with Censors: The Priests approaching, and passing by him, they sung those
Ceremonies which they use to the dead: then followed them the ancient old
men, attyred all in black: then followed them, a great number of young
youths, bearing green Laurel in one hand, and Palm in the other: then
followed them a great number of Soldiers, and men at Arms: the Cors^et men,
trayling their Pikes after them, and the shot with the noses of their Pieces
downwarde: Then after them, the Horsemen attired in masking wise, and every
man a broken Lance in his hand: Then came the mourning Preests, and singing
men all in black, and using their funeral Dirges: then followed a black
Coffin, and on the top thereof lay a Sheeld, and in it was engraven, and
curiously wrought, Love, and Loyalty, the one embracing the other: and
afterward marching hand in hand. Beside them, were as it seemed, two faithful
friends, or two unfeigned Lovers: the one fained as though he had been fallen in
a swoune, and the other seemed very sorrowful, and lifting him up again: and
a little from, they seemed to walk merrely, and with a sweet countenance.
After the Coffin, followed young Damselles, and Maidens unmarried, their heads
decked with Flowers, and their bosoms furnished with Nosegayes, carrying green
boughs in the one hand, and a light in the other: Then followed the ancient
Matrones, mourning, and with Lawnes about their heads: and last of all, the
old Segniors, with whom was Henricus, the Uncle of Narbonus. Phemocles then
running to Henricus, demanded the cause of his mourning, and the meaning of
that company? Who answered, for his only friend, and Nephew, Narbonus: Whereat
Phemocles could not refrain weeping, nor hold the trickling tears from his
moist cheeks: yet thinking to see the end, and to behold him laid in his
grave, he followed the company, and went after them into the Church: Where,
when they were come, and at the graves side: Phemocles preased close to the
Coffin, and stood hard by the grave: when it was set down, the Sheelde taken
from it, and the clothes taken from the Chest, the Priests leaving singing,
and the funeral Rites ended, they were putting the Coffin into the ground, and
giving him the last duties of earthly motions: Then there came an old Woman
weeping, and desired she might come to the Coffin, before it was put into the
ground, which granted her, and that she came near to it: she kneeled down,
and used these words. O Narbonus, one of the flowers of Vienna, and one, whom
for thy calling was not inferior to any: how hard has Fortune dealt with
thee, to take thy life from thee, in ye best of thy years? and what meant the
Sisters to spyn thy thread no longer, when the increase of thy body, should
augment the name of thy Progeny? and when thy children should longer have
stayed the name of thy house. Behold, how the young men lament, and see how
these Maidens wayle and weep, because no children are descended from thee: and
in that thou never knew the nuptial Rites. Then looking to one side, and
afterward round about her, at last she espied Phemocles, and saw how he stood
weeping: then speaking more earnestly then before, and using her words more
fervently: behold said she, thy beloved Phemocles, and look how he lamenteth
thy loss, take thy farewell of him, and then depart so soon as it lyketh
thee: behold him I say, ready to go into the grave with thee, and would be
content to accompany thy soul: And with these words, the Coffin suddenly
opened, and he came running forth, and embraced him so hard as he had done
before, and then he began to make a discourse: But with those imbracinges
Phemocles awaked, and had nothing between his arms, but the post of the Ship,
then felt he the warm tears on his cheeks, and began to look on him self,
musing at the first whether it were true, or that he was beguiled with his
fancy: but seeing it to be but a dream, and a fleeing shadow, he erected him
self on his stalking legs, and stood leaning over the Shyps side, but this
dream could not out of his remembrance, nor these thoughts pass from before
his face.

The wind was so prosperous, and blew so good a gale, that they quickly
arrived at Vienna, and came to the desired Haven, where he was gladly received
of his friends and courteously entertained of his Father, who demanded the
cause that he looked so ill, and by what means he had lost his good coullour?
Who answered, that the nature of the Country had altered his face, and the
contrary diet lost him his coullour. Then his Father questioned with him of the
estate of the Country, and of the Kings Army, the goodly Towns which he had
seen, and the fertility of the Country: who answered so directly, and made
so prestrict replies, as his Father perceived he had not loytred, nor spent his
time idly.

Not long after, his Father was moved to frame a journey to Cullen, and
Phemocles must make up the mess: not only to see the Country, but also to
renew acquaintance with some of his friends, which he had not seen long
before: where he purposed to spend the Summer, and to make his return toward
Winter: But before he went, he made a feast to his friends, and invited his
neighbors to a bancquet, which he speedily performed, and the day following he
took his journey: There were certain of his friends accompanied him in this
journey, and other Merchauntes, who had business to Cullen. Phemocles saw at
the feast, amongst the other good company that were there: a Gentlewoman, the
most fairest as he thought, that ever he saw in his life, and so beautiful,
as he had not seen the like before: yet at that time, he not so much marked
her, as he after in the time of his travail, wore her in his imagination: he
had not any conference with her, nor moved her so much as with one question:
but in the way he could not put her out of his mind, nor banish her out of his
remembrance: Falling in talk with one of his Kinsmen, and reasoning with him
of sundry matters: he asked him some questions of their courteous company, and
so of such a Gentlewoman? Who answered, that she was their neighbors child,
and her friends very hon^st, and of good calling. With this report, he set
Phemocles in the mire up to the ears, and in Love, to the very crown of his
head: He was before but touched, but now infected: before his love lay
smothering like wet straw, but now it burned so bright as a bauen: who still
imagined, that time would fear away these fancies, and the distaunce of his
journey put her out of his mind, but he blew the coals, and kindled the fire
him self: and thinking by little, and so more to put out that blaze, he
increased the flame, that it burnt out: for always when they came to their
Innes, and alighted at their resting places, he went to his solitary Chamber,
and used no other place of solace, musing on his malicious Fortune, and blaming
his adverse hap: that first he was deprived of his faithful friend, and now
had seen her for whom he was thus sorrowful: always imagining, that had he
but spoken, he had been sufficiently satisfied: and had he but moved the
matter, his desire had been the less: He never could rest, these thoughts so
troubled him, nor never stayed any where, but so he was assailed. After this
long travail, they arrived at Cullen, where they spent some days in viewing
the Town, and afterward departed to the end of their journey, which was
about fifteen leagues farther, or a little more: Where at their arrival, they
were very well entertained. Phemocles could not sufficiently recreate him
self, with all the fine daynties they had, nor well be content with the
greatness of their cheer: for that dainty dysh was far off, which he fed
on, and that pleasant mor^ell some thing out of his reach: Thus houered he
like a Hawk, between Heaven and Earth: never so high as the one, nor at any
time so low as the other: or like to the sheaues in time of Harvest, tumbled
up and down with a whirle wind, never stay at one place, but are removed
still to an other: or as the leaves that fall from the Trees, are carried first
into one corner, and then removed into an other. In like manner ^litted the
fancy of Phemocles, and so wandered his mind about, never thinking to
despair, and yet he could not persuade himself of gayning his desire, in
getting the good will of his sweet Saint, and finding her favorable, whom he
honored above all other things: thus he houered in hope, and yet doubted
despair: Spending thus the time of his abode, and wearing out the tract of his
absence: he always under some coulored pretense repaired to his Chamber, and
under the cloak of his collusio^, he remained thus in his cogitation: yet not
known to any, nor apparent to one: for all that he was watched by some, and
marked by others: for he was busied with some Book, though his mind were not
there: and writing some tryfle, though his heart was far of: and though he
held a Book in one hand, yet with the other, he would wyllingly have held a
Candle to ye shryne of his Mistress: and if his lyps mumbled these words, and
then stayed at that letter, yet his imagination was how to compass his desired
wish, and his thought how to obtain his will: and if his tongue bewrayed him
to be at Euensong, yet in mind he was scarce at Morrowmasse: worn with
musing, and pined with the prolonging of his penance, his travail seemed so
tedious, and the time so troublesome, as he hasted more then was needful,
unless he had come a little sooner. The best part of Summer was spent, and the
time grew near his departure: he therefore took leave of his Kinsmen, and gave
them many thanks for their great courtesies. Phemocles seemed well contented
with this, and was very joyful of his going homewarde, and I trust he spared
not his Boots, neither left his spurs unoccupied: his Horse curssed his
Master, and the Hostler wyshed him hanged that rode on that Horse: Now he
that was before so given to Melancholy, turned the innerside of his Cappe
outward, and could sing with the most in mirth, or bear a part with the best
in melody: who more glad, or who more joyful? who more pleasant, or who
better disposed? feeding his fancies with hope, and drinking the drammes of his
delyghts: Who marched not now under the ba^ner of Venus, and who bare not a
Standerd with him, was no Souldior, nor worthy any pay: Thus he manaced in
mirth, and road in the remembrance of his sweet Mistress, till they alighted
at Vienna, and came to the place of him long desired: Now devising the means
to speak with her, and practicing how to have any talk with her, often
passing along under her window, and walked by the Porche, where he imagined
she should sit. Not long after, as he passed along that way, and used his
accustomed walks: there came forth a servant, who went into the Town about
some business, of whom he asked whose house that same was, and then his
Masters name, still walking along with him: then he asked if he had never a
Son, nor ever had any daughter?

Yes replied he, the more his sorrow, and the greater his grief: A son he
has, a young youth, wise* and well learned, honest, and well beloved of all
that know him: he has a Daughter besides, of beauty very fair, and for
making excellent: for qualities inferior to few, and for behavior, not any
that has better: and were her good hap correspondent to her virtuous
education, her preferment might have been passing good, where now it is
excellent ill. You shall understand, that she is married to a young Merchaunt,
who is not so good a husband as he might be, nor so much for his own
commodity, as for others disprofite: He had left him by his Father, some
possessions, and Lands sufficient to mayntaine his estate: which were all
mortgaged before his marriage, and turned out unknown to my Master, and his
Wife suspecting no such matter: and now he is gone, his departure not known to
any, nor manifested to none, when will be his return, by reason whereof, she
conceyueth such inward grief, as my Master doubts much of her health.

Phemocles thanked the servant for his courtesy, and bade him farewell: Then
returned he home, not very well pleased, but very sorrowful for the ill
success of his sweet Mystresse, and more sorry, because he knew not how to
redress her ill hap: but most discontented with himself, and angered
thoroughly, for that he bestowed his lyking upon one who was already spedde,
and loved her that was before married: But seeing the Fish already taken, that
he cast his Net for, determined to bestow his bayte else where: thus was his
expectation made frustrate, and his speedy posting turned to a short bayte: But
seeing his Mystresse wedded, and him self beside the Saddle, minded not to
eat all his bread in Vienna: nor to sing Mass, but in one Church: not to
sleep every day in a Truncke with Clearchus: nor to catch Flies once a day,
with Domician: not to dwell always in a Tubbe, with Diogenes: nor to taste
nothing but Honny, with the Prophet: As he had learned some knowledge, so
meant he to be a little better experienced: and in that he had framed two
voyages so unprofitable, he thought to try if the third would be better, or
more grateful: Finding his Father at so convenient leisure, as he long looked
for, and watched that time long of him expected, he moved him with many
matters, and then of his own estate, saying.

Sir, he that seeks, finds: and he that trauayleth, his labor will some
way be requited: always tarry at home, and evermore a woodcocke: he that
always pleads with just Evidence, is in possibilytie to obtain his suit:
but who so holds his tongue, what needs the Defendaunt any farther trial?
The Merchaunt must make his Mart, before he know his gain: and the Captain
fight, before he come to the spoil: and the Scholar proceed Batcheler,
before he come to be a Doctor. I have trauayled twyce, and framed two
Uoyages, the one unpleasant, and the other unprofitable: If I make the third,
it will I think be better, for that it can not well be worse: You see sir,
that time taryeth not long, and my youth waxes now ripe, and now is my
memory most perfect, and my wit at the best, and now should it be
watered with the dew of understanding, and moysted with the lycquor of life:
which is, to gain so much knowledge, as our terrestrial nature is able to
conceive, and to obtain those heavenly motions, which this earthly Pilgrimage
does yield unto us: the greatest sailors to seek in some Seas, and the
greatest trauayler, in some Countries unknown: the greatest Writer never read
all Authors, but he that has most, may be better stored: Must not the Tree be
graffed, ere the fruit be good: and the Uine be kept cut, or the Grapes will
grow wild: the Oil must be kept close, or it will stink: and the best wits
delighted with new things, or the old will grow out of use. And in my
judgment, a man were better be unborn, then live untaught: vnbred, then
vnmannered: not begotten, then without behavior: Yet I think my behavior not
so simple, but sufficiently to serve where there is no better in place: but yet
not so much, but were it augmented, my state were the better, and my rude
manners more commendable: for good education, is so necessary as riches: and
good nurture so commendable, as large possessions: Lyketh it therefore your
fatherly affection, to give your grant, and cast your consent, for to do
contrary to your instructions, and to seem disobedient in the duty I owe you,
I wysh not longer to prosper, or afterward to live. Pleases you therefore, to
prefer me to some noble man, I would gladly (you wylling) there to spend a
year in service, to learn somewhat, and to increase my profit.

His Father hearing his request, and not finding it any way blame worthy: for
that it is given to all youths to spend some time that way, and very
profitable it is for their better education: made him this answer, and replied
as follows.

Son Phemocles, the Hawke cannot soar abroad, till her feathers are full
come home: and the Child must be stayed before he go by him self: the Coult
sadled, before he be trauayled: and the Dog cast into the river, or he learn
to swymme: A Man must learn the Law, before he come to give Judgment, and
your self must be learned, before you teach others. For as every Tree has a
time to grow, and every strength a season to increase: every wit must be
wrested, before it be perfect: and every action allowed, before it be
tolerable. So Phemocles, more to day then yesterday, and wyser hereafter, then
witty now: the grass grows, but who sees it? and the Dyall goes forward,
but who perceyueth it? the Sun proceeds in degrees, but who perceyueth her
moving? so thy wisdom increases by small quantities, but who knows it but
thy self: And for yt thou think service so profitable for thy estate? as I
see not how it should be prejudicial: the strength of thy knowledge thereby,
likely to increase, and thy understanding to be augmented for thy profit: my
denial shall not breed thy decay, nor my staying hinder thy furtheraunce: I
know Virgill could not versifie, before he could speak Latin perfectly: nor
Tullie write so sweetly, but he had a trusty Tutor: Augustine, not divine so
Clarklyke, but brought unto it by his Books: and Ptolomy not cast his Earde,
but he first knew his Compass: Thy behavior can not now be so good, as in
time it may be: nor thy judgment so great, but hereafter it will be more: But
thou must think that service is no heritage: and the life of a Serving man,
not many degrees above the life of a servile bondsman. I think thou art not
ignorant of the shyftes of Service, nor greatly to seek in their crafty
collusions: their wages are but small, and their wasting great: their profit
but little, their pain rewarded but simply: their dillygence much, and
rewarded but slenderly: their bravery passes* and their payment but poor:
they always are needy, though still sparing: spend much, and have but little:
and he that can not shyft and swear, always wants, and is ever bare: But
yet some honestly disposed, and very well given, wise and sober, discrete and
learned: some good, and some badde: But the greatest sort, follow the lewdest
way, and the others so idle, and so dishonest, so slavish, and so slothful,
that he which has practiced it a while, makes it for ever an occupation:
Therefore I admonish you not to be lavish of your purse, but lyberall of your
courtesy: you have daily examples of young Gentlemen, that spend their
lyuinges, waste their revenues, and sell their Lands, to mayntaine their
bravery: to royst it with the greatest Ruflers, and to swear, with the
stoutest swearers: to brag of their beastlynesse, and to boast of their
manhoodde: You shall find such companions for dycing, and such fellows for
gaming, as be you not wary, your Purse will be p^nnylesse, and your money gone
to make a new Mart: but I know that you can not play, the more for your
profit, nor swear, the more for your safegarde: He that uses one, is lykelie
to dye a beggar, and he that delyghteth the other, the curse of God will never
depart from him.

And upon this condition, I grant you my good will, that you spend not
abooue one year, and then make your return. And for that you are ignorant,
where to place your self, and how to be preferred, I will speak to a freende
of mine in the Palsegraues Court: whom, I know will not deny this small
request, but further you to the uttermost of his power: And I am the better
content, for that he is a wise Prince, virtuous, and godly disposed, where you
must use such dillygence, as you may be lyked, and behave your self in that
order, as you may be loved. For I think: he that deserves well, shall be
sufficientlye recompensed, and who meryteth nothing, is unworthy of any thing:
mean while prepare your self, and make ready such necessaries as are wanting.

This their purpose took so good success, and went so effectually forewarde,
as there passed no long time before the Father of Phemocles met with this his
freende in Vienna, who came to dispatche certain business, for the Duke his
Master, who no sooner moved the matter, but assurance was made of his
entertainment, and shortly after Phemocles was sent for, who departed
straight to the Court: then he took his dutyfull leave of his Father, and
craved his obedient blessings, who willingly gave him his request, and wylled
him to be myndfull of that which he before had told him, and bade him make so
short return as he had promised.

Phemocles departed to the Palsegraue of the Rheine his Court, where he was
very well entertained, and better welcome then he looked for: where he behaved
him self so well, and used his matters so honestly* as he gained not only
the good wylles of the common sort, but also he won the hearts of his
Superiors, to like and love him: where, let him enjoy what pleasure he may, and
obtain all the delights his heart desires.

NArbonus had continued a season at the Emperors Court, and worn away the
best part of a year, without any profit to him self, or possibility to
get any for his friends. He saw the bravery of that noble Court, and
viewed at full, the lives of the Courtiers: and I trust, had his Purse been
answerable to his noble mind, none should exceeded him in brave apparel, nor
any gone beyond him, in setting forth of his beauty:

He that was of late so careful a Soldier, is now grown a stately
Courtier: and he that not long since, pyned in perplexity, begins now to
exceed in bravery: and that body that of late bare so poor a pore, has now
forsaken his seruilitie, and is wedded to awayte on friendly felycitie: Of
late drowned in despair, now standing alofte in disdain: not long sithence,
subject to all corasiues and cares, now marches in the feelde of Fortune,
holding out his Flagge of defiaunce, against all dangerous demeanes: who of
late was at Deaths door, and ready to go to the Grave, is now in proud
Paradize, walking amongst the sweet shades of security.

O Narbonus, have thou so soon forgotten thy myserie, and already put in
oblivion thy perplexity, that thou beginnest to wallowe in the mire of thy
mind, and to tumble in the dyrt of thy desires? Have thou so soon forgotten
thy pyninges and sharp showers, that thou flatterest thy self, this thy pride
will never be trodden down: has the procuring of thy felicity, been the
occasion of the leesing thy honesty? Esopes Snake, that was laid by the fire,
stung the man for his pains: and after this life, thou go the way to infect
thy Uncle against thy folly: The Tree that blows fair at the first, may so
be blasted, that it never bear Apple, and thou that find so sweet a show
in thy Uncles house, wylt leese thy credit in thy Masters service: Have thou
touched Pitche, that thou must needs be defiled: or eaten poison, that thou
art so infected? thou suckest hurt, where thou should gather honey. And
because there are Frogs in the water, can thou therefore find no fish? the
Cherrie is ripe, before it be rotten: but thou art bruised before thou art ready
to gather. Remember Narbonus, that when the Tree is at the best, it will grow
to nothing again, and when thy bravery is at the best, thou shall sink for
shame: The Infant learneth to creep, and then afterward to go: but thou
go so fast in the beginning, as shortly thou wylt neither stand nor stir.
But happily thou wylt reply: the Court bounseth in bravery, and why should not
I be painted with Pride? Because there are some Ruffians, thou must be a
Royster: and because some are wicked, thou must be mischeeuous: because they
swymme in sin, thou wylt be drowned in thy desires: And because Cayne slew
Abell, thou wylt be Saul and kill David: because Tarquin was proud, thou wylt
be Prodigal: and because Judas was a Traitor, thou wylt be rebellious. No,
better for thee to leave the Court, and follow the Cart, then to forsake thy
substance, and forgo thy friends. Does not the River Nile, yield Gold in the
bottom, and bring forth Crocodiles in the bancke? Does not the best ground
as well yield Thistles to prick, as give Corn to sustain? Has not the Holme
tree pricking leaves, as berries for Birds? Because the Court is curious, must
thou be lascivious? thou see the little Mouse eats the flower, but leaves
the husk: and does not the Woorme eat the curnell, and leave the shell: the
Caterpyller deuowreth the fruit, but touches not the leaves, and the Weasell
sucketh up the yolks, but leaves the shelles. Because the Court is given to
pleasure, must thou therefore be vnthryftie? thou know the Emperor is good,
can his Laws then be evil? But thou wylt say, his Laws are good, but the
Judges are not righteous: the house is well governed, yet there are evil
Officers. Has not the cleanest house, some Spyders? and the fairest Well, some
Frogs? the goodliest blown Tree, some blastes: and the best Corn, some
Poppey: the finest Flower, some fault, and the fairest Garden, some Nettles?
And in what place will the Serpent lurk, but in the green grass? and where
will the Snake make her nest, but in the rytchest dunge?

O Narbonus, art thou a Scholar, and never learned law points? and art thou
a Divine, and never studyedst Ambrose? a Philosopher, and never dydst look
over Aristotle? a Poet, and know not Ovid? an Astronomer, and have not
Ptolomies Globe? a Poticarie without Drugges, and a Physician without an
Herball? Look once again in the Glass, and thou shall see a spotte in thy
face: behold well thy body, and thou shall see it infected, and search thy
mind, and tell me if it lack not amendment. Yes trust me, thy body lackes a
Purgation for thy Pride, so would thy soul be clean for thy God. Art thou
now on thy Pantaffles, that of late had no Shoes? now pounced, that late
wast naked: and now bragging in thy bravery, that late wast subject to
poverty? the Glass is set so high, till it be cracked with a fall, the Cock
boat tosseth so long in the wide Sea, till she be drowned: and the Fox
comes so often to the Henues, that he is taken with Dogs. Know thou not
that the simple ^hrubbe, is in better safegarde from the wind and weather,
then the high Cedar tree? And the stone that lies on the ground, can go no
lower, but the brick on the house top, is often cast down and broken: Is
not the Sheepheardes cottage in more safety, then the stately Tower? and is
not the fat Horse sooner spoiled, then the lean Jade, and the simple sotte
tarryeth still at home, when the lusty youth leaves his life in the wars?
Is not the mean merriest? why then ^^ryuest thou to exceed? and is not the
low estate surest? why then prouest thou to excel? And goes not the Ship
surest in the narrow Rivers? why then rowest thou beyond thy reach? Does not
the subject live more quietly then the King? why then would thou be a Lord?
Remember that thou seruest in the Court, and not walk the streets in
Vienna: that there are here more Cosins then Kinsmen, and more lovers for lucre,
then friends in whom thou may repose thy faith: more Countrymen, then
acquayntaunce, and yet better known then trusted: Were thou as wise as
Themistocles, there are here will excel thee: and had y^ the experience of
Phillip, yet should thou be to seek for thy safety: Had thou the
sprite of C^^us, there are here would counteruayle thee: and were thou as
boulde as Brisaidas, thou should be out bydden: Had thou the tongue of
Pericles, here are those that would outreach thee: had thou the Lute of
Paris, yet some that would pass thee, and the Spear of Achilles, yet thy
strength were to weak. How then can thou blame the Court, and excuse thy
self? and how can thou reprove their vices, and not condemn thy own
faults? and how can thou paynt out their pride, and not show thy own
wickedness? The Spider and the Be, come both to one flower, the one sucketh
poison, and the other gathers Honny: Does not the Adder drink, where the
Coult sippeth? both satisfied, but not both hurtful: And does not the Adder
engender with the Lampray, the one poison, and the other a dayntie dishe: Is
there not as well Susanna, as Iesabell? and as well Aaron, as Pharao? as well
Apollo, as Pan? and as well Salom^n, as Midas? Thou art to take thy choice, and
none to hinder thee: if then thou do not well, whom can thou blame but thy
self? There is both Justice and Judgment, leave the one, and escape the
other: both honesty and hatred, if thou be infected with the one, thou art
free from the other: both freendshippe, and falsehood, and he that loves the
one, shall hardly gain the other. The next way for a man to be loved, is to
follow that thing, which is used amongst the greatest number: but he that is
led with every facion, and won with every wind, shall never be loved with
the most, nor lyked of the least: Words prouooke a man to anger, but they
draw no blood: and who so cannot bear a word, must not live in a common
wealth: The little Playsse, lives by the Whale, and the Lamb by the Lion, the
Ape by the Elephant, and the Kydde by the Tiger: every man may live by his
Superiors, behauing him self as an Inferior: as the old saying is: The
Catte lives by the King, and a Princes will is nothing worth, without the
consent of his subjects: Has not the woorme as well her hole, as the Fox his
burrowe? the Moule her hill, so well as the Lion her den? and the Hen her
roust, so well as the Phesant her perch? and the Bird her nest, so well as the
Hawk her Mue? But who loves not to clime higher, and who more often falls?
The Court is curious, and I careless: one catches a fleece, and another finds
a farewell: one gapeth after gain, and another peereth after pleasure: one
after pride, and another after paltrie: one after rytches, and another after
ryotousnes: As for my self, I have been infected, but will not be defiled,
tasted with the touch, but not tried to the lack: searched to the uttermost,
but not found guilty at al: though I ran like a coult, yet now so ientle as a
lamb, and though so wild as a Bucke, yet now so tame as a Dog: and though
so hungry as a Tiger, yet now gorged so full as a Hawk: and though praying
upon every carrion, yet now so choice as may: be though won to every lust, yet
now wedded to none in lyking: and though pind to every sleeue, yet now not
painted to the picture of any. My Lord and master looks for much service,
and expects great diligence, and though I please him not with the one, I
trouble him not with ye other: he speaks fair, and promises much, but
performs little, and warranteth less: if dilligent above measure, I gain
sometimes a good countenance at his pleasure: if never so little dislyked,
then envied, and hated: watch late, and rise early, but neither recompensed,
nor gratified: ride, and run at every call, and so lightly recompensed,
oftentimes, just nothing at all: we wait, and gape to see how they feed, and
sometimes we catch somewhat, but more often go hungry to bed: the best
that I ^ee, is Wine at will, and who so drinks best, has the better
bargain: our gifts are small, and our wages less, we can neither live of the
one, nor make our selves rytch with the other. Less I spent, when I remained
in Vienna, little do I profit, and more consume here at the Court: as good
catch flies all day, or lie in a Tubbe, as loyter away my time, and be as a
Droane amongst Bees: an unprofitable servant, neither beneficial to his
Master, nor commodious for his own utility.

The youths that accompanied Narbonus, were more given to prodigality, then
myndfull of their honest demeanor: allured him to like that he loathed, and to
embrace that which he detested: his fellow servants, in his Lord and masters
service, more regarded his lyberalitie, then wayed the depth of his honesty:
yet he was beloved of the most, and hated of few. But Fortune, who was never
favorable unto him, stood now as contrary to his purpose, and as unhappy for
his health: for do he what was possible to be done, and seek all the means
he could devise, neither could he please his Lord, nor like his Lady: his
diligence as much as might be, yet his rewards so simple as could be: his
pain unpleasant, and his profit nothing worth: his travail troublesome,
and his toil not regarded: his service comparable to the best, yet none of his
fellows less regarded: his expenses so little as might be, and yet his Purse
always empty: his charge that he took on him was troublesome, and prospered
so ill as a man could devise. Which perceiving every thing fall out so
contrary, and any thing not to be lyke^, did he never so well, and nothing
dislyked of others, were it (...) so ill: Finding time and place, he ^nfolded
his (...) and vttred his inward (...), as follows. The Ore yoaked all the
day in the Carte, eats his meat, and sleeps quietly at night: his Master
though he toil in his own travail, yet is he ^erry in his own house, the
Gardner and the Hedger, the Haruester, and the Planter, though they abide the
travail of the day, yet at night they are glad, and make good cheer. But we
Courtyers must wait all day, and watch all night, run all the day, and yet
not rest at night: tear the day in travail, and spend the night in some
paltrie: rise with the first, and rest with the last: who lives so miserably
and yet who so myserly? who more brave, and yet who more beastly? who more
dayntie, and yet who more diuelli^^? who more curious, and yet who more
careless? who more given to vanity, yet who more desires great glove? Alas,
is this the bravery of the Court? nay, is it not the mirror of filthiness?
Are these the fruits of felicity? nay, are they not the seeds of (...)? Is
this the good and honest life? nay, is it not the wicked and mischeeuous lust?
Is the Court a place of pleasure? nay, is it not the garden of grief? a plotte
of repentance, rather then a platform of patience, and a Sea of security,
rather then a chest of chastity? the Tree is known by his fruit, and the
Foul by her fether, a man by his manners, and a knave by his conditions: a
Courtier by his coin, and a varlet by his vanity: the greatest gain is
grief, and the rytchest reward, but a simple share: Mischeeuous are the
imaginations, and wicked the wyles, unprofitable the pain and unfruitful the
gain: If the imaginations be not good, can the protence be honest? if the
wyles be wicked, must not the dealinges seem devilish? If Fortune be
favorable, what hope is there of felicity? if the pain be unprofitable, who
will weaue his own destruction? If their gain unfruitful? who will gape for
flies, and travail without reward, for his labor, the best is no better, and
the worst ^nlykelys to be amended: A man must here, either bear two faces in
one hood, or be made with one face so subtle as a thief, hold with the Hare
and hunt with the Hound: flatter the most, but soothe all: he that cannot
dissemble, must not dwell amongst Devils, and he that cannot lie, not live
amongst loyterers: he that cannot halt, not go before criples, and he that
cannot he lame, not come amongst beggars: Why then stay I in the Court, and
not go to Vienna? why go I not to my Unckles to be lyked and loved, rather
then stay here, to be lothed and hated? why seek I not to please him and
profit my self, but staying^ here displeasure my self, and offend him? why
walk I not the streets to confer with strangers, but spend here my time
with brablers, and brawlers? why talk I not with trauailers, of the estate of
other Countries, but stayinge here, is neither profit to others nor pleasure
to my self? But what will my Uncle think? that so soon I forsake the Court?
nay, what will he think me in spending my time so ill, some fault he will
think is committed, that I return so shortly? nay, an Ass he will think
me, for wearing away my time so loyteringly: But stayinge here, in time more
profit may grow: but in time that little that is left may be spent, and then
away with the beggar: But the Ship must stay for the tide, rather then time
tarr^ for hy^ that uses it: but in staiing so long, my Ship will boe
vnfraughted, and then who will fill her as before? He that hops well, shall
have well, and he that dreadeth no danger, does oftenest escape: but he
that has, and hops for more, may live by the loss, and repent to late for
his profit: But can the net be filled so soon as it is thrown in the water,
(...) the Grape gathered so soon as it is touched? but he y^ fish thin a
shallow river, shall fill his Net with Fr^gs, and he that gathers Grapes
with one finger, shall never fill his Basket: But the Husbandman tarieth the
riping of the Corn, and the grafter the growing of his trees: but he that
sows amongst stones is like to ^eape but Thistles, and he that sets Trees
in the Sea, may stay so long as he live without fruit: But the Mint master
has his Silver first melted, and then he facioneth it with some portrature:
but he that has his mine yet to find, may hold his hammer long in his hand,
before he strick ever a stroke: But the Merchant must have his ship ready,
before he cross the seas to make his mart^ ind^^de, he must have his ship,
but he must first have money, and he that has the one may have the other when
it likes him: But he that buildes a house must tarry till summer, otherwise
the frost will spoil his work begun: but he that staieth so long may let out
his money in other matters, or happily spend it in ye same time: But no doubt,
Narbonus, in time the wind will turn to thine advantage, though as yet thou
strive against the Streme: but better it is to cut the fleece in summer, then
tarry till winter, and leese all the wol: But if happily thou ^orsake the Court,
how wylt thou then spend thy days? that is a Drone and no Be that cannot
gather honey to feed her self, and he an idle servant that can work no way
for his living: But staying with thy Uncle, thou may at some one time or other
purchase his displeasure, then the which there is nothing more prejudicial? nay
rathe^ staying with him (in time) I may win him to my will, then the which
there is no one thing more ben^ficiall: Why then Narbonus persuade thy self,
and forsake the Court, for here then spendest thy tune, and there thou may
reap some commodity: here thou have a loytering life, and there thou may^st
be busied to thy profit: here thou sowest the seeds of thy unthriftiness,
and there thou may ^eape the fruits of thy felicity: here thou graftest
trees, that will yield but Crabs, there thou may leave the ^histles, and
gather Grapes for thy gain: here thou fishest* and can find but Frogs, but
there thou may fill thy angling hooks with red ruddocks. But how shall I gain my
Lords good will to leave his service: such a small reque^t if he deny me, he
would hardly grant me a greater matter: The inditour deserves good will for
his Book, be it never so ^^mple, and I meriter, favor for my service, had it
not been so curious: The labourer has wages for his work, be it never so
small, and I deserve freendshippe for my diligence, had it been less then it
was: The offendant craves but pardon for his offense, and I crave but pardon
for my hones^ b^hauio^^: then persuade with thy self, he will (...) thy
request, being so reasonable, I deserve no less, my service has been so
effectual.

Upon this determination, he departed to his Masters Chamber, thinking to
awayte some time to unfold his mind, and to make manifest the inward
motions of his heart: But his long lurking could not attain the cause of his
coming, nor his hasty speeding obtain his purpose, as him self wyshed: he
was therefore forced to find some other time more fit, and to spy some other
place more convenient: Shortly after, being merely disposed amongst his
fellows, imagining no such matter, and doubting no danger, a messenger came
from his Lord, with more speed then profit, to answer, and obey what he would
say unto him: who was not more ready then wylling, for that he thought both to
answer, and demand: reply, and request: dutifully to use obedience, in what
he should command him, and favorably to crave pardon for his departure: but
the Pot was at his nose before he looked for it; and his master made the
motion, before he expected it: who came into the Chamber and did his dutiful
obedience, expecting what service his Lord would c^^mau^d him: who espying
Narbonus come into the Chamber* wylled him to come near him, and then spoke as
f^lloweth.

Narbonus, thou see the charge I am troubled with, and the great company I
retain, the cost that is used in keeping the Court, and the expenses that
arise without any comminges in, the furniture of my Horses, and the Armor of
my men: the one makes me a nyggard of my pursse, because I have it not faster
then I spe^nde it, and the other a churl of my lyberalitie, for that I cannot
give as I would. As thou have been dutiful, so may I do thee pleasure, thou
shall not be frustrate of thy purpose: and as thy loyalty with honesty has
gained good will, so shall not I be found ungrateful to repay thee with
profit, in any thing whatsoever, the preiudicialitie of my estate excepted.
Thou have spent a year in service, and have gained thee so much the more
knowledge: to tarryed with thy Uncle, thy wit would been weryed, where now
thy behavior is answearable any, or inferior to none: Had thou not come to
the Court, thou had wanted this wisdom, and in seeing these sleights that
are used, thou wylt be more wary at thy return home. Thy profit (indeed)
might have been more, and thy pleasure less painful: but here thou have
conceived more understanding, and learned to hold fast when thou have it: And
though thy years are young, yet thy experience is proved: thy head unstayed,
yet thy knowledge sufficient: thy nurture good, and thy gravity better: In
spending thy time longer thou shall profit little, and thinking to win much,
may here leese all: He that studieth any language, when he has learned it,
forgets it not again. Thou have learned the life of a Courtier, and what
would thou more? The Coult once broken, is put into the Stable: and thy
affections brydled, thou must keep them under. The Book read over is laid up
again in the study: Thou have bought thy learning, and now may use it as
thou lust. The fruit ripe, is gathered and laid up to be eaten: Thou have
reaped the knowledge of courtinge, keep it therefore till thou need it: If
thou have profited with thy pleasure, thy pain has been well employed: And
if thy gain have been good? I rejoice at thy fortune: If thy favor have
been friendlye, I am glad of thy felicity, and if in profytinge thy self,
thou have not hyndered my honor: Thy welfare is wished, as thou would
desire, and nothing contrary my mind: When the Grape is ripe, it is gathered
for the press: when the Apple is ready to fall from the Tree, it is plucked
down to make Cider. Now thou have learned what thou may, and gained the full
perfection of thy pre^^^^^: The Frost is not hard till morning, and the Fig
not ripe till it be gathered: the Cherrie not ripe, till it be soft, and no
sooner ripe, but straight rotten: And when any thing is at the best, it
decreaseth again: But thou wylt answer me, the longer a man lives, the
wyser he is. I reply, that experience, makes perfectness: but he that is a
fool at thy years, will never be wise, whylst he lives: Do thou not see
the young Tree has more plenty of lycquor, then the old Stock of juice? and
is not the green grass sweeter, then the old hey? and the young Calfe more
tender, then the old Ox is toathsome? Does not strength decrease, as Nature
decays? and as Nature wareth feeble? does not the Wit grow faint? Every
Tree has his time, and every seed his season: every grafte their growing,
and every grain the sowing: every Child the nourishing, and every wit
the time of perfection: The Gold is earth in the Mine, before it be purified,
and the Silver makes no show, before it be tried from the sand: The Orrenge
not beautiful, before it be ripe: and the knowledge of a man, nothing before
it come to the fullness. Is not the Ceder tree, more goodly to behold, then
the Uine that runs along upon the ground? and is not the Popler, more
lively to look on then the Fig? Is not the Leoparde, a more goodly Beast
in sight, then the little Lamb? yet the beauty of the one, nothing equal to
the virtue of the other: the heyght of the one, inferior to the fruit of the
other: and the show of the one, not like the savor of the other. If then in
things that make no outward show, there be hydden such inward virtue: how
much more is that commendable in him, who bears a fair face, and is endued
with honest conditions? But who amongst the Romans, was more eloquent, then
Cicero? yet who more fearful to utter his mind? and who more bold then
Crassus, and yet who more cross in aunswering frowardlie? Was not Agamemnon, a
wise Prince, yet counseled by Nestor? and who more valiant then Anthony, yet
ruled by Lepidus. If the excellency of the greatest personages, were subject
in wit, to their Inferiors? and if the wisest sought counsel? the bouldest
were broad mouthed? and the most eloquent, fearful to speak? who lives, but
lacks, and who has so much, but may have more? For to sow the seed of thy
youth in the Court, thou art like in age to reap but pain and travail. And
for that I know thou will not always be a Courtier, nor evermore a Seruitor:
for would thou that way lead thy life, I could say somewhat worthy thy
lyking: Or had thou set down to spend thy days in service, I could
better hereafter satisfy thee, then now make thee answer. I know when thou
come to Vienna, thou will follow the Merchaunts, the better lyked shall thou
be of others, and the more loved of me: If thou be rich in thy young years,
thy age is like to be replenished with substance: and if well disposed in thy
infancy, a sign of honesty in thy gray heaires: if thy Inuentus, show some
wisdom, thy Senectus likely to be honorable. If the trade of a Merchaunt
like thee not, thy busy Books will delight thee: toss them well about, and
they will comfort thee in thy heaviness: tumble them up and down, and they
shall make thee wiser, and shine more bright in virtue. Thou wast sometimes a
Scholar, the more fyt to be now a Studient: thou once begannest the Law, the
more lykelie now to prove a Counselor: thou wast sometimes earnest at thy
study, why should thou not in time prove a Doctor. Leave not off at the
best, and draw not thy head out of the collar: Now thou have entered the lystes
of learning, let not go thy hold. Thou marueylest that I tell thee this, yet
I know it, and not by any but thy friends, neither would I utter it to any
thy foes: And in that I tell thee so plainly, it is a sign that I hate thee
not: Therefore in my mind to persevere in thy learning shall be most for thy
profyt, and greatest for thy gain. Thou know he that begins a good
work, and goes not forward withal, seeks his own disco^moditie, and the
preferment of no other. The Dog is made ientle with feedinge, and the Ape
knauishe being taught: If then these senseless things will be made ientle with
teaching, and profitable with compulsion, how much more we learn for our own
vtilytie, and gather knowledge for our own commodytie? Knowledge is the
heauenlyest thing in this world, and he that has wisdom cannot want any
good thing. Whose memorial does longer endure, whose fame further reach, and
whose glory blown forth abroad, then the virtues of the wisest, and then
their doings put down in writing? Did not the wisdom of Solomon make a
greater show, then his riches or brave buildings? Did not the works of
Virgill longer endure, then the Conquests of Caesar last. Great Princes are
thought happy, in that they are victorious and rich, but virtue shines when
the riches with the man are buried. The Conquest of Alexander were al lost
within a little time after his death: but the works of Ovid are fresh and
flourish at this day. Diogenes was called a Dog for barking at the vices that
they used: But are not his works now more famous, then his deeds were
disdayned: Stilpo said, he lost nothing, when all his goods were burnt, for
that he retained his virtue and learning. The ground of other matters may in
time be attained, but the depth of wisdom can never be reached. All handy
labors are wrought by the industrye of man: But the root of wisdom could
never by any be undermined. Is not learning the flower of felicity, and happy
is he that attayneth it: For in what do we exceed the brute beasts, but by
those heavenly motions which we attain by learning?

The Slave is a man, and the simple sot made as we are, but yt their natures
are inferior to our nurture: And were not a man better be unborn, then
untaught? How do the degrees of Princes first rise, and how do they increase
their dignities, eleuate their houses to the Skies, and their fame over the
world? Is not wisdom the first ground, and then policy ensues? And how shall
a man be wise, if unlearned? Can Nature of it self, yield a man that
knowledge, or give a man wisdom, without learning? Can the vngrafted tree,
bring forth good fruit? And does not the fattest ground, bring forth
Thistles? The better Horse, the more wild of Nature, and the better wit, the
more given to vice: for of our selves we are the least, and not so bad as ill
disposed. The Elephant, greatest of al four footed beasts, and who more
ferce, or who more strong? but once reclaymed, so ientle as a Lamb, and so
necessary as a Horse: Will not the Crab stock be made to bring forth pleasant
fruit? and the stony ground be made fertile: The ouerflowinge Rivers be turned
to run quietly: and the haggard Hawks manned as they will stoop at every
lure: The great Ox will be made to take the yoke: but the little Mouse will
never be made ientle: And the Bear sooner follow a man, then the Fox. The
fair Faulcon will sit ientlye upon amans fist, when the little Bird will be
ever flirtinge. Therefore if my advice may prevail, and my judgment take
effect, you shall not loose your learning, nor spend your time but in study.

The court, you see is curious and careless: infected with ye one, poisoned with
the other: And in doing me service, you displeasure your self: not that I
mean any other should retain you, but better then well to spend a man's time
none can: you have gained for your coming, and learned for your lyking: and
l^rger to tarry, shall you do any other but wear away your time? and for my
pleasure and preferment, the one is not great, nor the other such as I would
wish it were: But such as it is, I will neither be dainty of the one, nor
curious of the other, prove it when you lust, and try when you shall: therefore
you may depart when you will, and hasten to Vienna as you shall think good:
and the more hastily you prosecute your voyage, the more speedily shall your
coming be thither.

Before he had fully accomplished the end of his tale, or furnished the
perfection of his talk, cited he was by one of his Gentlemen, to repair to
dinner, which tarried for his favorable leisure: who so soon as his tale was
ended, and those words spoken, went his way, and stayed not to hear his
reply: Leaving Narbonus hoouering between heaven and earth, as if he could not
attained the one, nor touched the other: standing like one newly raised out of
the grave, or lately revived out of a swound, wavering which way to take, and
wandering which pathe to tread: Who had seen the sails of a Ship, wavering
with a soft wind, leaning first to one side, and then bending to the other: Or
like a sheep sick of some disease, leans first to one side, and then falls
on the other: Or like the meeting of two violent waters, the one parts one
way, and the other retyreth back again. So stood Narbonus, first thinking to
take this way, and then thought that other better: If to leave his Chamber, his
Lord might come, and he not there to make answer, then to tarry and make a
reply not looked for, were but a saucie part: Then thinking that to stay there,
he might look long and never the better: and if his Lord would have heard his
reply, he would have leant him the hearing. Going therefore down to dinner, he
met, with some of his fellows and friends, who were more glad of his company,
then he willing to stay any longer: the dinner time they passed more honestly,
then merely: and yet so well disposed, as the one was not hated, nor the other
dislyked: where Narbonus vttred at large, the cause of his sending, and the
effect of his departure. Whereat, they sorrowful, beyond measure, but he glad
in mind, yet would not utter it: they fell to entreating him, to make a longer
time of his abode, and he as fast persuaded them, not to request a thing so
much against his profit: The^ they requested him to spend but one year more
amongst that honest company. Then he answered, that the loss of a years
study, was more then the gain of two years service: and to hinder himself of
the one, he would not abide the brunt of the other. Then they replied: that (as
yet) there was time enough, and so small space would hinder but a little, but
his staying might benefit him much: Then he answered, that to drive days, and
make delays, a man should be farther of in the end, then he was near in the
beginning. To avoid which inconvenience, I will not linger in hope of the one,
nor stay, being sure to miss the other. Then an honest Gentleman, and one that
loved him dearly, used these words to him.

Sir, the Merchaunt makes his Mart, but how? not in a day, nor in a week: not
in a month, nor happily in a year: he looks long for his Ship, and stays
the return: which once come safe, and arrived sound, the gain does
counteruayle the pain, and the long time of absence make amends with the
profit that ensues.

Indeed sir (replied he) the Merchaunt stays the Exchange, and abides the
fraughting: but my Ship, will neither bear sail, nor brook the Seas:
therefore, better it is to return with a little loss, then stay the repenting,
and leese both Ship and burden.

Then replied the other, sir Narbonus, services are not so sweet, nor Masters
so lavish of their Purse? but they will make a man bake his flower, before he
eat any bread, and sow his seed before he reap any fruit.

Truth (answered Narbonus) if the ground be good, who will not take pains to
husband it well, but being barren and stony, he that stays till harvest,
shall reap but Thistles, and gather but thorns, for his double diligence,
and passing pain.

Indeed (said the other) the ground must be good, and the plotte profitable:
but how shall a man be acquaynted with the one, or have experience of the
other? He must stay the trial, and prove for his profit, and if it be not good
for his purpose, nor lykely to yield commodytie, help it a little, and the
grain will be good.

Sir, replied Narbonus, the best ground is aptest to bring Thistles, and will
bear but strong weeds, if it be not wrought to the full, and sowed to the
perfection: As for the worst, labor what you can, and your profit shall
hardlye counteruaile your travail: but it may so happen, that the Sky shall
fall, then shall we take Larkes plenty, and other Byrds good store: But a Man
shall so soon catch a Hare with a Taber, or get a Song of a dead man, as
reap here the fruits of felicity, or gather the pleasure of profit.

Indeed, replied the other, the profyt is but small, and the gain as little:
but the company may cause you stay, for that they like you, and our fellowship
find you favorable in that we love you, for if we liked you not, we would
not lust after you: and, but that you are in our hearts, we could easily put
you out of our minds. Therefore, seeing (perforce) we must loose your
company, we will of free will retain your curtesy: which you cannot deny us,
the request being so reasonable, but cast your consent, and repay us with like
profit, when we yield so to your purpose.

Indeed, answered Narbonus, your company shall cause me do much, and your
curtesy so great as I know not how to requite it: For, look by how mutch the
more you love me, by so mutch the more am I bound to you: and by how mutch
the more I do dutifullye love you, by so mutch the more ought you not of duty
to hate me: and in that you love me so well, I am the more bold to utter my
mind so playnelye unto you: Yet as you love me, so must you not lust after by
loss: and as you like me, so must you not wish me live, but for my welfare:
being not prejudicial to your healthes and prosperity, but very grateful to
my wealth and safety.

Truly said the other, to like of your losses, or to be a mean of your
hindera^ce, we should neither profit you, nor pleasure our selves: and to
keep you contrary your will, or to retain you not as you wish, we should
make a long harvest for a little profit, and a large season for a little
Corn: therefore trust me, if you seek your own commodity, you are the
better to be commended, and he that is painful for profit that will be
gaynefull, has woue a good web out of a course Loome, and spunne a fine
threede of rugged wool: which if you pretend as prestrictly, as you answer to
do speedely, you to leese our small company, shall gain good will of all, and
in departing from us, you leave us not for ever: and in going to your Unckles,
you deprive us not always of your fellowship, and when you are gone remember us
in mind, and we will not forget you by Letters.

Replied Narbonus, for your courtesies I yield you thanks, and for your
favorable freendships, my life shall be at your commaundes: and if at any
time, contrary were my doings, yet honest were my cogitations: for the which
submission of mine, I deserve that pardon which is yours: As for my proof, you
have neither tried me of trust, nor sold me of credit: but would you use me in
some matters of weight, you should not find me to dally, and would you try my
good will, you should neither find me wayward, nor wanton. As for seeing you
hereafter, our departure shall not be for ever, and our adue for always: but
if I see not you shortly, I will write speedily: the messenger of the mind is
Paper and Ynke, which if I spare to spend on you, turn me out for a
wrangler, and shut me out of doors for a crauin Cock.

The Gentlemen thereby, maruayled at his wise answers, and were glad to hear
him so well disposed, and to hinder him of his purpose, they would not stay
him contrary his mind. Shortly after, he asked if his Lord would command him
any duty from his honor, or any service to Vienna? whereto he answered none:
But to hear of his welfare, and commendations to his Uncle.

Then departed he the Court, and traveled toward Vienna: but his beloved
fellows and dear friends brought him out of the Town, and there left him,
he taking his leave of them all, and they not a little sorrowful of his so
hasty departure, bidding him be mindful of his promise in sending, and not
to forgette them by writing, whereto he condescended, and willingly agreed.

His Uncle had heard before how well he was disposed, and how excellentlye
beloved, which comforted so his spirits, as he reioysed at the return of his
Nephue, who was no sooner alighted from his Horse, and come into his house,
but he embraced him, as if in a long time before he had neither heard of him,
nor seen him, glad to see him so well, and joyful of his return.

After a few days were spent in making merry, and some time passed for joy of
his coming home, Narbonus fell to his study, and trusted to his Books: in so
much, that he was loved of all, and not disliked of any, and in short time he
profited exceedingly, and grew very learned: And amongst other matters, he
enquired of the health of Fidelia, though she loathed to hear him named, but
she had so handled the matter, and stirred the stern in such order, as where
before her credit was comparable to any, now her misdemeanour could match
with the most: for a Gentleman in the Town of great calling, and whose credit
was worth much, used her company so long, and gained her good will so far,
that though he were married to an antiente Gentlewoman, yet was he martired to
her beauty, and tied to her favor, and in time gained that grant of her
goodness, as she was at his command with daily diligence, and frequented his
house, and used his company in such open order, as had she bin more than
honest, she must have lost her good name.

I know not whether her good neighbors were to be blamed, for their reports
blased out in such beastly bravery, or she not regarding her estate, and
keeping an old man company, and not looking to her honesty: But whether Fame
were no flatterer, or Report no liar I can not give judgment of the one, for
that I am ignorant of the other: but this is certain, and these words were in
every man's mouth, that she was spedde of a freende, and needed no other
husband, one way to satisfye her deyntie desires, and another way to serve as a
cloak for her crafty collusions, which caused Narbonus to bewail her
wilfulness, and lamente the lavishness of her honesty, yet he purposed
willinglye never to see her again, for he had given her the last farewell
long since: this was the fruit of such faithless oaths, and the profit that
ensues of such dayntie dissembling ones.

Phemocles had now spente his time limited by his Father, and desirous not to
make his time of tariance longer, the good will of his Prince therefore once
granted, he repaired to his father so speedily as his journey could be
hasted: where when he came, his favorable entertainemente was nothing
contrary his expected purpose, who now was as careless of the world, as
before careful to keep every company, desirous now to spend his time in
study, and lead his life in reading of Authoures, as well to increase his
wit, as to make him grow more perfect in wisdom: as well to furnish his
Study with Tragedies and Comedies, as to retain Histories and Chronicles: as
well to refreshe his weeried senses with the sweet savor of his beneficial
Books, as to cloy his chaste ears with any other foolish devises whatsoever.
Thus Phemocles profited by experience, and waxed wise, with the atteyning of
sundry languages. It happened not long after the father of Phemocles was invited
to a feast, and Phemocles was desired to awayte on his Father. Henricus was
bidden also thither, and Narbonus entreated to keep him company: where at the
appointed day, they approached to fulfill their former promises, and
accomplished the inuitours request as they were earnestly desired. Narbonus
came in with his Uncle, and Phemocles with his father were there before:
Henricus and Narbonus saluted the courteous company with a manerly good
morrow, which Phemocles and his Father requited with as grateful a greeting.

After Dinner, the old Gentlemen discoursed of diverse Countries, the habit
and manners of Strangers, in so much, as there grew a controversy of the
Country of Spain, and Germany: and one disliked the reasons of the other:
Henricus was defendant of the one side, and the Father of Phemocles resistante
on the other: Then said Henricus, my Nephue can say somewhat, for his learning
was like to cost him his life: Then answered the Father of Phemocles, and my
Son is not so simple, but he can his cross row, reading it so often: Then
were they willed all to keep silence, and no partiality to be used on either
side: Then an auntiente Gentleman of the company, delighted to hear some
discourses, took Phemocles from amongst the company by the hand, and by the
other hand he took Narbonus, and bringing them to this assembly, said.

Gentlemen, the case so stands, and the determination is such, that you two
amongst the rest of the other good company, though of years but small, yet
your experience greatest, and for that you both have tasted the tediousness of
travail, and endured the running over that Country of Spain, it is allotted
the one of you to maint^yne an argument against the probabilities of the
other, whether Spain be best governed, or Germany better ruled? whereto
Narbonus replied.

Sir, were my experience answerable my good will, or my wit agreeable to my
willing mind, I could answer you somewhat of the one, and resolve you fully of
the other: but such as it is, your courtesy so great to request, my
liberality shall as duetifully be extended, either to defend our weal
public, or to defend that noble Country of Spain.

And Sir, answered Phemocles, were my knowledge so great, as my willinge mind
shall be easily seduced, you should not so hastily command, as I duetifully
willinge to obey: But hopinge my simple discourses will be imputed to the
readiness of goodwill, my simplicity to be cloaked with my obedience, and my
rudeness hidden by consenting so quickly to answer your demands: let
therefore that Gentleman if it please him, be defendant for Spain, and my
self to my little learning, and less knowledge, will be maintaynour of our
native Country, and stand to maintain so far as I may: To the which
Narbonus consented speedily, and Phemocles agreed willingly. These two
Gentlemen stared the one in the face of the other, and neither was known to
other, yet Phemoc^es mistrusted that it should be Narbonus, yet uncertain
whether his sight failed him, or his judgment were not right, stayed til
better occasion should be offered, and time more fit to manifest his mind: then
said Phemocles as follows.

This Noble Country of ours ruled by a wise Prince, and governed by a famous
Monarch, whose good laws are inferior to none: and whose just Statutes do
counteruayle any christened: But touching the Country which is more fertile
for corn, and better replenished with Vineyardes: more fruitful with pastures,
and better stored with all grain: we go beyond them in the noblenes of
personages, and far better qualities: better s^ruitours to our Prince, and more
profitable for our Weal public: As for the inferior sort, their
dispositions far more honest, and their good natures not inferior to their
godly nurtures: their quiet life and honest conversation, ruled with modesty,
and brydled without rigor, not given greatly to offend, but seekinge much to
please: As for our youth, their education is much better, and their natures
applied to their future profits: they do some thing before they conceive any
thing, and are learned before they understand what it means: if ability be
wanting in the Parents, and that they cannot maintain them as they would,
some good science they are straight employed to, or some craft or cunninge to
maintain their estates afterward: And if the Father a Soldier, and a man
child borne him in the time of his service, they put him in pay, at the day
of his birth, the better to maiytayne him, and the more honestly to have him
educated: Touching the estate of our women, and the honest behavior amongst
them used, theirs is inferior in honesty, and nothing like in beauty: neither
comparable in wisdom, nor like in modesty: neither like them in wit, nor
equal to them in good grace: The apparel of ours far more handsome, though
theirs much more costly: the attiring of their heads more seemly, and the
wearing of other things much better: ours chaste and godly, theirs easy to
be entreated, and companions for any: If in any thing they excel, it is in
the liberality of their courtesy, and if in ought they be better, it is in
the much bounty of their brothels: therefore I prefer our Country before their
calling, and our honest lives, before their wicked liuinges.

In deed Sir, replied Narbonus, to touch the estate of our Prince, and meddle
with the Supremacy of the Empire, I should prove my self an Ass, and in
defending a fool, but I leave him, and omit his estate: But for their
Nobility, and their Estates, I think them not inferior to ours, nor of less
substance, then our greatest of calling: both in magnanimity of birth, and
greatness of substance: both for noblenes of mind, and liberality toward all
men: both for the good government of their own estates and houses, as also,
for excellency in maintaining arms against their enemies. For the inferior
gentility and such others: the Gentleman though he be poor, yet is he
haughty: and though he be not rich, yet thinks he himself not inferior
his Prince, the estate of his calling set aside, and the greatness of his
Office excepted: for the which his Office, he prefers the effect of his
duty, in reuerencing his person, as his Captain, and chief governor: and
for that he has the rule, he is content to be ruled by him howsoever:
otherwise, his manhood not inferior to his Princes, nor his personage one
degree less then his: As for the common sort of people they live and lack
not: if they have nothing, they beg not any thing: for he scorneth to ask of
any man, and disdaineth him that thinks he will crave, and rather will live with
Roots like a Swine: the^ in wanting crave at the hands of any other: he
stands upon his Pantables, and regards greatly his reputation: and if by
his simple Science, and poor Craft such as it is, in all his time he gain
so many Duckates, as for one day will make him brave, he will have his
Footecloth, and Pages after him, though ever after he live by patchinge a
Boot: And in that their Nobility, being not prejudicial to their Prince,
they show a more haughty mind, and seem to have less care in carrying their
coin with them to their Grave. For the women, their liberty is lackinge, and
their honesty looked up: their restraint is great and their license small,
unless in walking their own Gardaynes, or frequenting the Churches, though
happily their chastity be loose, and their honesty as lavish: yet is it done
closely, and they kept restrained by their Husbands: their attire costly, and
their apparel gorgeous: their beauty in deed not the best, and yet fair
enough: their diet dayntie, and their feedinge fine: they spend not the day
in banquetinge, nor the night in surfottinge: that which they eat is little
and good, and that which they drink healthy, though not pleasant: For their
Children I will not compare them in Learning, but prefer them in any other
good qualitiesd whatsoever: for nurture they want not to give entertainmente in
their young years: and so soon as they are come to any perfection, they
learn to break their Staves at Tilte, and such like, I think them therefore
not inferior to ours, but we rather Cockneys to them: Touching the goodness
of the grounds, and the fertility of their feeldes, they far exceed ours,
and we that way cannot excel them: their goodly Uineyardes much greater, and
their Grapes far better, and our Rhenish excepted, what have we like them?
Their goodly Olive Trees, and their fruitful Figs: their Orenges, and
Lemmons: their Pomgranates, and their Dates: their Reasons, and their other
small fruits, ye goodness whereof is better known to other Countries, then the
trafique manifested to us: their royal Rivers have the only name, and bear
away the Bell, as well for sweetness, as for fruitfulness: their substance of
gold, and plenty of Silver, passes all others christened: and is known more
bountiful then in any place we know: I think us therefore more base then they
in condition, and far inferior in riches.

Then said Phemocles, Sir their gold is their richest substance, and their
silver their greatest gain: But do you allow this their courtesy, or think
it any part of good manners: the Subjects to use familiarity with their
Prince, and to esteem himself so good a man as he?

This shows rather a base kind of deformity, or else a foolish proud
fantasy, neither to be ruled by reason, nor to be persuaded by courtesy:
the King beeinge the cheifest member, is allowed for the head of the Country:
the Subject a profitable member, and a mean to preserve the substance. Is the
Subject so good as the Magistrate? and any Officer so great as his Ruler? the
King his auncesters were Princes before him, and he bears not that title
undeserved, why then are not men unnoble elected Princes, and every man chosen
a Magistrate? wherefore then were Princes made? and why were they elected? why
then are Governors placed in their seats to bear sway? and wherefore
Magistrates elected to reform and correct? why then have officers their names
or titles? or wherefore are Justices appointed to give judgment? Is the
Latchet so good as the Shomaker? and the carved Picture equal with him that
made the portrature? is the Skin of the Bullock so good as the flesh? and
the rind so sweet as the Apple? is the harbinger so good as his Lord ^or the
servant not inferior his master? is the Souldioure so good as his Captain?
or the Bondslaue like him that makes him free? is the Captain so good as his
Coronell? or the Lord equal to his Prince? Why then is not the Nettle so good
as the Rose? and the brier of so much virtue as the Grape? the Hornet so
profitable as the Be? and the Frogge so good as the Flounder? the Thistle so
good as the Uiolet? and the Woolfe so good as the Ox? Is this profitable in
their calling? nay, is it not reproachful to their kingdom? why? the Horse
knows his rider, and the Sheep follow their Shepeheard: the Dog his
master, and the Lion his keeper: and shall not a man that has sense, and is
endued with knowledge excel these brute Beasts that have not the one, and
want the other? Are we not bidden to obey our Rulers, and fear our
Magistraters? and who so resists the will of his Prince, purchases the
displeasure of his God: But how should they offend God, when they know not his
name? and whom should they obey, when they acknowledge not their Prince? They
will sooner stoop to a stone, and bend to a block, than honor their King,
and be ruled by their Regent: is this their life not detestable? and how can it
be other but reproachful?

Replied Narbonus, touching their Religion let that pass, and if it be not
good, God make it better, but that neither touches our argument, nor agrees
to our purpose: and though they use not their obedience with the courtesy of
the Cappe, yet they declare their humanity in the bending of their bodies. The
Prince they confess to be their chief, and are ruled by his laws, but yet
every man thinks himself so good as his superioure, and every inferior not
worse then his Magistrate: For what makes Rulers but riches? and what causes
Magistrates to bear sway, but the multitude of their goods, for take (says
he) his living from him, and let me have his lands, and he will obey me, as I
reverenced him, and do me duty, as I yielded him service: and shall his Gold
make me his subject? and shall my virtues be inferior to his substance? though
he be wealthy, yet am I virtuous, and though he excel me in coin, yet is my
manhood better than his substance: let him overcome me in the feeld, and then
will I render him my arms, but if he refuse to fight with me, I disdeyne he
should be my superior: I have ventred my life, and he has but paid some of
his living, but had his living bin lacking, and as small as my substance, he
should have dangered his life, where now he hazarded but my soul: am I then
inferior to his riches? nay, is not he subject to my honor: and because you
have said so much, and are entered into the law of arms, we are I confess
good soldiers, but yet inferior to them: we must either fill our hungry
paunches, or fight we will not one stroke: we must have our Beef, and our
bags filled with Bacon, our Cheeses carried after us, and our Women so follow
us: and if we march one day without filling of our great guts, we think
straight we shall to the pot, or no other remedy, but present death: and
they can march three days, with drincking a cup of cold water, and eating a
morsel of bread, and regard no more eating till their enterprise be ended: if
happily at their return they gain any thing by their travail, and have taken
any spoil with their pain, they make their conquestes appear by the bravery
of their backs, and their gold shall gilte their Rapiers and headpeeces. We
having gotten any thing by spoil, or gained ought by sacking, all goes into
our bellies, and had we more, it were too little for our pi^ed paunches: then
tumble we like beasts, and wallow in our wickedness, as drunken as Swine,
and as devilish as Epicures, and forsooth he is best Souldioure that most can
tipple, and he oldest frayned, that can first set his fellow ^o^^er the
Shoes: these are commendable, and these are to be liked: these are to be
loved, and these to be embraced: the^ follows swearing and brawling, lying,
and ^^rsing, for a trifle together by the ears, and with a wette ^^nger
friends again, they contrary so moderate their affections, and so rule their
appetites, that a trifle shall not force them to quarrel, nor every toy cause
them fight: but he yt offers injury, shall be injuriously dealt withal,
and he that uses discourteous words, were better offer boisterous blows,
and who so gives the lie, may hap so togayne the loss of his life: they
therefore muffle their mouths that they speak not too broad, and tie up
their toungs, least they babble those things for which afterward they cry
Peccaui. I think therefore their modesty does pass our manliness, and their
goodness nothing inferior to our greatness.

Replied Phemocles, their feats of arms may be great, and their prowess
every way equal^ to ours, but when a word shall cost a man his life, and
every cross answer required with a Stabbado: their ^^stinesse I think is
int^llerable, and their haughty minds desire too much reuengemente: and if in
talking a man shall so offend, whom shall he try to trust? and if in
walking a m^n, must be so warye, they should go alone without any
company: Is this manhood? nay, is it not malitiousnesse: each man thinks
his fellow infe^ioure, and every one his companyon, not woorthye his calling:
Are not these disdeynefull to contemn their fellows, and friends? and are
they not hateful to pretend mischief for so sle^der occasion? Is this
courtesy? it is (indeed) curiosity, a sign of a mischeuous mind, and a
certainty of a disdeynefull stomach.

Then said that Gentleman standing by, who brought them to the Bar:
Gentlemen, I am sorry that time will not serve to go farther with your
argument, and place not permit to end that which is begun, we therefore
give you thanks for your courtesies, and can not but commend of your judgment.

Sir, replied Narbonus, this courtesy is but small which we have used, and our
curiosity had bin great, had we made denial of your demands: And for my part,
if any pleasure be conceived by my ragged reasons, I rejoice the time has bin
so bestowed, and thank this good audidience, for lending their favorable
ears to so simple a Sophist as my self.

And said Phemocles, if favor be granted me for my good will, and freendship
given for that which I said, it is the greatest gain I look for, and the most
pleasure I expect: and if any occasion have ^in offered to the preiudicialitie
of any, or some word escaped, that (...) not be disgested, I grieve at my rash
sayings, and crave pa^rdon for my lewd words, but the prouokers I think will
have me excused, and those the procurers cloak this my rude riming: an^ for
their audience being so freendly, I yield thanks bountifully, do^bting not
but in time to prove a more perfect Cl^arke in the Rules of (...) the; and a
deeper (...) in the judgment of my elders. But Sir, by (...) freendly favor,
may I crave the name of you the defendant, which pleases you to let me
understand, I shall be bou^d^ to yo^re courtesy, and united to your
freendship*

Sir, said Narbonus, to deny you my name were small courtesy, and great
curiosity: therefore you shall neither condemn me of the one, nor convince me
of the other: know you therefore that I am called Narbonus, Nephew to that
Gentleman Henricus.

Phemocles at that word, stared in his face as uncertain whether he had
heard him speak, or not seen him standing there before him: but casting all
cause of suspicion aside, and arming him self with the truth of his eyes, he
ran and embraced him so hard, as if he should have revived him beeinge
swounded, and then uttered these words, and spoke as follows.

And has my hap been so hard, to contend this day in argument, and to make
such several replies against my dear Narbonus, my best beloved friend, and
him only whom my heart has so long desired? Which had I known, my mouth
should not have opened against thee, nor my tongue unfolded those thoughts
which proceeded from my heart: But what soever has been foolishly passed, let
nothing: I pray thee be maliciously taken: but this good hap I think God
bestowed on us; to manifest unto each other the freendship before passed, and
to renew our ancient amity by these contrary questions: know thou therefore
Narbonus, that my self is thy faithful Phemocles, who prefers thy life,
before his felicity: and honors thy health, as his own happiness.

Then said Narbonus, and art thou here the most faithful living? and have I at
last obtained thy sight again? my lot was lucklesse, and my hap to hard, to
contend with thy favor, and to speak so boldly against him, whose life is
more dear unto me, then my own health, and whose happiness I prefer before
any other thing living: And had I known these ^^uishe lips had spoken such
way ward words before thy favorable face: I would either have forced them
never to speak more, or else to moderate their sayings with such modesty, as
they should neither offended frowardly, nor have spoken so wilfully: But as my
heart the inuentor of all my sayings, never me^^te thee mischief, nor
pretended thee treachery, so pardon I beseech thee this my boldness, and
forgive my mis^emeanour, in not craving thy courteous name, and asking some
questions touching thy estate: which seeing thou have consented to be the
first inuentor in askinge, I shall as willingly condescend to any thing
whatsoever, and longer I wish not to draw the bitter breath of my lingringe
life, then to be always ready to die, the faithful friend of Phemocles: and
look what soever you shall command Narbonus, he is always pressed a Voster
commandment.

The company upon this renewed amity, left the siege, and departed every man
to his proper Mansion: Phemocles and Narbonus departed to a secret place, where
they recounted each to other their tragical lives, and the causes of their not
meetinge: Then they determined for the time they had spente, and their years
so young: the one but five and twenty, and the other lackinge somewhat of that
quantity: to put it to writi^ge, and to make it manifest, the one, not without
the consent of the other: Then lastly, they determined to lead such a
prestricte order of life, and never to use these foolish toys, which before
they delighted in, as all other youths should leave their foolish fancies, to
follow their well disposed demeanours: which determinate purpose took so sure
ground in the interior parts of their hearts, as should never be removed to
the exterior parts of their bodies. The fertile Feeldes began the bale of
their bitterness, by conioyning of their amity: and the beautiful Banks ended
their unhappiness, by renouatinge their forepassed freendship: where I leave
them to swim in their secure safeties, and to bathe in the benificialitie of
their beatitude.

Narbonus shortly after not unmindful of his former promises, thought not to
requite the goodness of his fellows, with the ungratefulness of his follyes:
directed a Letter, the tenor whereof, insueth as follows.

To the Gentlemen, his fellows at the Emperors Court.
THe colored spots in the sides of the Leopard, d^^ bewtifie his broad
back, and cause his soft^ skin t^ be more seemly: and the wrizled wart on
the fair feature, makes the perfect portrature more amiable. The Rose growing
amongst ye nipping Nettles, looks more lively, and seems more sweet: and
the abundance of vile vices flowing in hat Noble Court, make the excellency of
their vert^es bear a greater grace, then otherwise they would: the inhumanite
of the rude rascalles without manners or civility, cause the courtesie^ of the
Courtiers to make a more kind of mild modesty: The Court I know not to be
void of dissemblers, nor free from faithful friends, not without malicious
persons, nor lacking honest companions, not without deceytfull doultishe
dastardes, and yet many of the brood of ^aliaunt Ulysses, not lackinge
shiftinge, and ^ogginge tear bags: and yet many noble Gentlemen, whose
excellent virtues are to be preferred before their revenues: there is the
freendship of Ionathas, and the falsehoode of Jason: Paris with his Harp, and
Hector with his Helmet: the fidelity of Laelius, and the flattery of
Aristippus. The Rose being perfect of it self, is by sundry means infected:
And the Court being the head of all virtues, is replete with many vices: who
boasts not in bravery ^ and who braggeth not in beastliness? who waloweth
not in wantonness of his will? and who tumbleth not in the turninge of
treachery? who daunceth not in the daintiness of his desires? and who sleapeth
not in the security of his sins? Alas Gentlemen, the Sun having once
attained the midst of the day, draws so low down at night, that she is
clean out of sight: The most troublesome Tide has but his time, and the
fruitfulle^^ Tree, green but in Summer: the greatest felicity lasts but a
small space, and the happiest health is but the length of a spanne: the
sweetest conceyte retayneth his virtue but a season, and the finest Fig will
quickly be rotten: Beauty is blasted with every contrary cogitation, and the
finest flowers are fair but till a man inioyeth them: the delicate meat is
pleasant but til a man has eaten it, and the happiness of gaining the fairest
women in the world, lasts but till a man have reaped the first fruits: The
pleasure of the Court lasts but the time of beardles youth, and an old man
in the Court, is like a withere^ (...) in a green Forest: Every little cloud
that racketh over ye Sun hinders her light, and every wagginge of a straw in
the Court, purcha^eth displeasure^ When the wrinckles come on thy face, who
will favor thee? and when thy Bearde waxes hoare, who will love thy
likeness? The old horse is turned to grind in the Mill, and the old Dog
whipped out of the doors, for the service he did in his youth: the young
^trumpet with her bravery, in age is glad to bear the name of a Bawd: Did not
Helen weep when looking in a Glass, she saw the wrinckles on her face? Alas
said she, who will not now hate me, that before harbored me? And was not
Layis a young bedfellow for every man, and an old B. to every one? And not to
rome far for foreign examples, but to take part of our own Country for
trial: I commend our Noble Emperor* Charles for his prowess, but I blame his
wisdom in this respect: in youth so noble a seruitour, and now to take in age
the courtesy of a Cloister: He that learneth not to be unfortunate in youth,
must perforce be unhappy in old age: The young Lion is wanton so long as he
is fed, but when he prays for him self, he is fierce and furious: Was old
Menelaus loved for his loyalty? no: he was lyked for his living? Phillip the
Father to Alexander the Great, often wept to see his Son so fortunate in his
youth, for his death (said he) must needs be conspired before he be old:
But is not the fairest Flower, finest to be geathered? and the fattest Horse
likeliest to be bought? the rypest wit readiest to be reclaymed, and the
fairest Women likelyest to be loved? yes trust me: and yet the wisest that
ever was, or the subtillest that is like to be, has loved in youth, which in
age he has loathed: One delights the love of Ladies, and the likinge of
lovers laws, which passes away like a blast of wind, and withers like a
Rose plucked from the stalk. A man spends, and speedeth not, lauisheth on
with load, and all to please his peate: he spares neither Lands nor living,
money, nor moueables, houses, nor feeldes, gold, nor gain, apparel, nor
paltrie, to boulster up his bare body, to please the peevishness of his meek
mistress, and to feed the fancy of his loving Lady: he spends all his
Lands, and consumes all his livings, and in the end rewarded with a
faithless farewell, or bidden to adue in the Devils name: And if he obtain
his purpose, and gain his greedy desire, once gained that he long expected,
and that obtained for which he made such suite and service, what is he the
better? or wherein the richer? which way more satisfied? or how better
contented? in what order better pleased? or so glutted, that he never desires
more? nay, in pleasing his appetite to displease his God, and in fulfilling his
lust, to leave his own liberty and living: and in gorging his greedy fancy,
to purchase his hinderance, and undoing: and if he win her to his will, and
lure her to his lust, without the loss of his living, or the morgaging of his
lands, does he not repent his bargain? and wish it were now to be made?
first, for charges to bestow in apparel, and for expenses in jewels, as well
in money, as in linen, and as well in cofers, as in coin: then the suspicion
that he falls into, and the dangers that are always likely to arise: If she
be married, then the suspicion of her Husband, and the marking of the household,
their appoyntings of places, and agreements of times, the meetings to enjoy
their desires, and the fears they conceyne to be seen: and if she yield him
a child, and bear her husband none, he doubts whether it were his own, or
some other man took so much pains for him: And if her husband have children
by her, and he using her company, he doubts the disabilitie of himself, and
fears he lacks part of that he wants not: but if she neither have
children by her husband, and be barren to him, he doubts every man's finger
is as deep in the dish, as his in the platter, and that every man angleth
where he casts his hook: If she be unmarried, or not wedded to any, he
fears secrecy, and doubts she is lavish of her liberty: If she yield him
any child, then his shame is manifest, and the crime too intolerable, her
credit for ever cracked, and his honesty for ever after hated: If she yield
him no child, then he either fears the insufficiency of himself, or
thinks some other is partaker of his felicity: then is she fearful to be
espied, and careful to be marked: then the cost of her apparel, and the
change of her cofers: But if happily he escape all these dangers, and avoid
all this cost, if she have bin honestly reported of, and liked of the most, is
he not sorrowful that his beastly desire would no way be satisfied, but with
the loss of the greatest jewel she has in the world? Then if she be neither
fair, nor well favored: neither beautiful, nor amiable: neither lovely, nor
likely: little honest, and perhaps a common ^addle for every man that will
ride: does he not then cry Peccaui, calling himself villayne for his vile
act, and base minded rascal, that could not better make his choice: Thus
every way she breeds a man's woe, and no way works his weal: each way a
man's loss, and not any way proves for his profit: the best of these but
little for his honesty, and less for his pursse: the woorst is ill for his
body, and pestilent for his soul: And how happy then is he that can live
without their companies, and thrice happy is he that in conscience craves not
their fellowship: As for the Gentleman Courtier, his felicity is not the
happyest, nor his gain the greatest: when he is in the prime of his youth, he
must be brave in apparel, and lavish of his pursse, neat in his going, and
stately in his gate: courteous of behavior, and curious in his choice:
liberal of his living, and no niggard of his loyalty: his grace must be
liked, and his manners marked: If he be a comely personage, then is he hated of
his inferiors: if fair, then effeminate: if black, then meeter to be a
Soldier, then ^tte to be a Courteour: if well favored, disdeyned of the
deformed: if kind and loving to all, then a Parasite, and a Flatterer: if
something strange of acquayntance before he be known, then proud, and
disdeyneth to speak: if rich, then a churl: if but of small revenues, then
a shifter, and knows not elsewhere to live: if high of stature, then a
lubber: if low of making, then a Dwarf: if liked of some Gentlewoman, then a
hunter of that kind: if he talk not in their companies, then precise, and
tied to his chastity: if not content to put up injuries, a quareller, and a
hacker: if patiente sometime to bear, rather than to make a brabbling for
nothing, then is he a milkesop, and as good a man as Maulkin: if liked of the
Nobility, and beloved of Gentlemen, then either he caries two faces in one
hoode, or does lie like a Dog: if disliked of a few not his friends, and them
some vain persons, therefore unregarded of many, and not beloved of any: if he
spend something liberally, then is he prodigal, and never minds to buy
lands: if something hard, then miserable, and a churl: if liked of his Prince,
then a fair tounged fellow, or he could never gained such good will: if not
loved for affection sake, then hated of all, and indeed rather a conspiratour,
then of any honest demeanor. Thus his best life is miserable, and
intolerable, the worse must perforce be disdeynefull, and reprochable: As
for the common Serving man, I would wish him no greater plague, nor tied to
any greater treachery: He must be up with the first, and laid with the last:
called on of every body, and ready to come to all: snatching for his meat,
and catching for his victualles: as hungry as a Horse, and as greedye as a
Dog: shifting with the most, and swearing with the best, bragging with any,
and quarelling with all: wait at an ynch, and paid at leisure: running in
have, and galloping in post: brave in apparel, but poor in his pursse: If he
can not shift, he must not account to live: as diligent as may be, and as
slenderly rewarded as a man would wish: If he go cleanely, his master
suspecteth the picking of his pursse to mainteyne him: if poorly, an
unthrifty rascal, and such a one as regards not his masters credit, nor
wayeth his own honesty: If he keep company, his master imagines all are
his charges, and repineth at his welfare: if saving his wages, and keeping his
apparel, then a hard Ass, a Clown, and a niggardly fool, his wages are ill
bestowed, and some other would do him more worship: If a pretty fellow of
personage, then a fool, that he seeks not better for his preferment, and a
place more profitable his estate: If any way disliked, as hard favored, or ill
faced, wrie legged, and crook backed, or such like, then is he kept but for
some pandor, or to carry the basket after his master: If for his honest
behavior loved of his fellows, then a prating knave, and one that regards
more the safety of himself, than the profit of his master: If by any means
disliked of his fellows, then hated of his master, for yt they like him not:
If liked of his master, and beloved for his good service, then hated of them,
for that either he flattereth, or carries tales, otherwise his credit could
not pass theirs, nor he liked, better than they loved: If disliked of his
master, then not liked of his fellows, for if they would, how dare they, and
if they durst, how could they, for purchasing his displeasure, and getting the
ill will of his master? if liked of his mistress for his good service and
painful diligence, then loathed of others, for either he has her at
commandemente, or obteyneth that benefit which none should reap but his
master: if hated of his mistress, then is his case miserable, for every
hour ready to be turned forth of doors, or baited and braulled withal like a
dog: If merrily disposed, foolish and Ass like: if civil, and soberly given,
then sullen, and a doulte without spirit, and better lost then found: If given
to exercises, then regarding naught but his own pleasure: If not disposed to
tear or spoil his apparel that way, then what a fellow is this? and how
has he been brought up? If learned that he can talk well, or indite
cunningly, then so proud of his paltry Clarkeship that he thinks none so
good a Scholar as him self, and his wit worthy to be preferred before any:
If unlearned, then the Son of a Clown, base borne, and worse taught, ill
mannered, and worse nurtured, he cannot say K. to a Goose, or make any
resolute answer: If left some living by his friends, and content to serve, to
preserve it, rather then ydely to loyter and spend it: then hated for that
having to maintain him self of his own, must seek the hinderaunce of his
fellows, by offering to serve without wages, and causing his Master to give
less wages then otherwise he would: If poor, and that diligently he wayt to
procure his Masters good will, in hope to be preferred, then keep him not to
long* least he look for some reward, but put him to some other less able to
do him pleasure, and not so much for his own profit: If he be young, he
needs but small wages, for he can shifte for one, and scratch for his own
advantage: If old, away with him, he does but shame our service, and is a
disgrace to our house: And if a man spend his small portion in maintayninge him
self, and doing his Master credit, he shall be answered, complaining:
why? my will was not thou should spend thy lyuinge, neither was it my
pleasure thou should sell thy Lands: and thou that so little regardest thy
own profit will be an unprofitable servant for an other man, therefore, go
ask of those thou spentst it on, and borow of those thou lentst unto: If
happily a man profit by his service, and that he have gained some part of a
living under him, as that chance is not common, nor that hay fortunate but to
few: then says his Master, see this proud knave, and this saucy Jack, he
braggeth of that he has craftily gained in my service, and cuffleth with the
money that came out of my Purse: neither ^oo I discommend the Master of that
Servant, but loath that servant that seruet* so simply: for if the Master
be blame worthy, the servant is twice treble to be discommended: neither do
I blame all service of the Court nor dislike of all seruitours, for then might
I be judged either staringe mad, or stark foolish: But this I speak to
touch those Seruingmen, who spend their time so lew^ly, and wear away their
young years in pleasure, where in their age, they pay for their repentance,
and (perhaps) beg for their bread: I am not ignorant that the Court must
have seruitours, and Gentlemen waytours: but he that will be a Courtier, must
be experienced in all other matters necessary his calling: and he that will
live by service, must make his choice on whom he bestow him self, as his
Master be contented with his diligence, and the servant rewarded for his
^aynefull travail: But yet the life of a Seruingman beeinge abused, where it
should be well used, is most miserable and his case most lamentable: The hired
servant his labor ended, receives his wages, and departs contented: and
the Weauer woorketh all the day merrily at his Loome, and rests contentedly at
night: the craftsman has his stinte, and hour appointed how long he shall
work: which once come, he takes his pleasure, and refreshes him self: but
the Seruingmans work is neither ended at night, nor begun in the day: morning
nor evening: Saboth day, nor Holy day: always trudging to one place or other,
and evermore drudging about one toil, or some endless business: The Festival
days when others make merry, he must wait what his Masters will is, and
look he be not lackinge: happily he wayteth all the day, and his Master
has nothing to apply him unto: then an other time thinking to take his
pleasure but a little, for an hour, or not so much, in the mean time comm^th
his Master, where not findinge him, his next salutation shall be, good
morrow with a knaves name, or how do you and be hang^d: then thinking to
excuse his fault, or crave pa^don for his offense* Thou varlet, and thou
roage: thou rascal, and thou misbegotten: so troubled, as no other is
turmoyled: and so afflicted, as no other is the like. Is this the perfec^
pleasure of the courtly crew? and the happiest weal of this weary warfare,
that a man shall learn a science in youth to beg in old years: Is this lusty
Iuuentus, and miserable Senectu^* is it a sweet Pill in the mouth, and a
bitter purgation in the stomach: Sugar at the first, and sauce in the end:
fruitful at the beginning, and loathsome at the finishing: If this be a
Science, it is none of the seven: and if it be a Cra^te, it is but simple:
easily practiced, and quickly attained: soon studied, and not hard to be
learned: This is subtilty without ^hift, and craft without cunning: policy
without practice, and learning without gaining: If this be a science, ^o wear
out a man's tim^ in pain without pro^it, and to spend a man's living in hope to
attain, and in the end never the wiser: to undo himself to pleasure his
Lord, and consume his ^oyne to keep his Masters credit, and to drown him
self, to save an other swimming? nay not so good: for he spoyleth him self,
and profits not his Master: What a maruailous foolishnes then is this? and a
sign of a small wit, for a man ^o spoil himself, not to pleasure any: to leese
that which no man shall find, and to do that which no man is the better for:
and what is he accounted off, his liuinges gone and his possessions los^e: a
spend all, and an vnthrif^: a prodigal child, and one not worthy to live
longer: he yt has spent his own, how will he keep an other man's? nay, he
that has c^nsumed y^ which was left him, who will give him, or inc^ease his
small portion? Do not then his enemies laughe in their fl^eues? and does not
every one po^nt at him? Do not his friends and kinsefolke utterly forsake him,
and not seem to take acquaintance of him? let him pass without a god speed,
and come by them (...), ere he be bidden drink once: if a man have money,
he can lack no friends, and he that has living shall lack no lovers: but
he that has neither, shall want all, and he that has little, shall quickly
have less: The little Ante, provides in Summer, and stoareth her house
against Winter: and the Be geathereth Honny in the heat, to stustaine her in
the cold: the Conye has her hole to save her from wind, and preserve her
from weather: and in the hardest winter, she will be fat with the Chalk
within her hole, and live with the earth, till she have fayrer feeding. What
then are we that cannot live of our selves, nor provide for one? nay, when we
have more then enough, that cannot preserve it against a harder time: We must
be fed like the young Crows, and nourished like the squalish Kytes, to
stand and wait for an other man's meat, and gape on them how they feed, ever
wishing them to eat hastily, and always thinking long till they have done.
The poor Co^ler that sittes sowinge his latchet all day, waytes not for his
meat at night, but says, I have labored, therefore will I eat: but we wait
for our wages, and gape for our meat: satisfied with their leauings, and
contented with the remainder of their fragmentes. The young Ox is put to draw
in the Carte, and past labor, knocked down for his good deeds: The young
Seruingman is dandled with delights, and flouted with felicity: but when
Curua senectus once comes, away with this dotarde, the slouen does us more
dishonesty, then ever he did us service: And what I pray you causes so many
Beggars, and increases so many robbers? forsooth the Seruingmen: nay, seruinge
slaves: for they take away the honest name of Seruingmen, and cause the^ to be
hated of the spiritualty, and disliked of ye Layty: One to shifte out his
sweating, and maintain his swearing, practices barde Quater Treis, and
Blanckes, Langrettes, and stopped Dice: high men, and low little ones: he
practices the high way to the Gallows, and the straight streate to the
Stues. This he uses so long, and continues so cunningly, that in the end
his knauerie being espied, and his treachery found out, some one reaches him
a knappe over the costard, that he carries to his grave, or the Stabbado in his
stomach, that he never plays more: Another uses a cut at the cards to
carue all the money out of a man's pursse, or to leave him as many faces as a
Sheep, a shifte to deceive the common Country people: Another practices
fensing and quarelling, braulling, and fighting, and his end is miserable, or
lamentable, commonly either slain, or hanged: if he escape them both, blood
requires blood, and some man will requite his courtesy, giving him that
weight he measured to others: Some other practices the art of cousonage, and
he is very cunning, yet never took degree in his life: he that uses it, if
his body escape, he shall hardly get pardon for his soul: Another takes up
money of his masters creditours, promising paymente by such a day, which he
will either perform, or let them burn the Bill: These, with a number more
lamentable than honest shifts are used for gain, and practiced for living:
and who the Authors, but serving men? or who the founders, but our fellowship?
which has caused our names to be hated, and our companies rejected: Of all
others we are not loved, and amongst all sorts of people loathed. If at any
time our names come in question, whether the matter be of weight, or but of
little value, whether praised, or vituperated: whether commended, or disdeyned:
if for good will to commend us to an unknown person, and such a one as we
never saw, nor heard of before: then enquireth he whether he be a Gentleman, or
a Yoman, a Craftesman, or of occupation, a Husbandman, or one of the Laytie?
no, replyeth the other, a waiting man, and servant to such a Gentleman: O
answers the other, a serving man, why then he cannot be honest: if he had bin
any other, I should have liked him, so that not only we are disdeyned, but also
our name is hated, our credit worse than the calling of any, and our
estimation the least of al others: And why are we not regarded? Because of our
ancient abuses, so that let a man be never so honestly minded, or so well
disposed, as by any means he can, yet is he hated for fashion sake, and
disliked for the antiquity of the name: If we be loved, either we are feared,
or flattered, and by our abuses we have not only purchased our own
discredit, but also called the names of our masters in question: For this is
the old saying, and not so common, as true: like tree, like fruit, and such a
Uine, such Grapes: as the master is, such of force must y^ man be: and in
deed, it often proves right, though sometimes it miss: But is it in our
Masters power to make an unthrifty servant a peaceable Citizen? and an unruly
jade will hardly be broken to ye Saddle: a rare matter to see a stately
seruitour prove a wise seniour, and a lusty hacster, a quiet Counselor: An
unbridled Bandog, will hardly be taught to hunt well: and an Ass is more fit to
carry a pack, then to serve one in the Feeld: A hard matter to make the wily
Fox a good Begle, and the Ape is made ientle, but will never leave his
knauerie: And forsooth, to use villainy to a man, is but a matter of jest, and
for all that, our Laws are so straight laced, to defile a woman, or to rob a
maiden of her virginity, is but a trifling laughingstocke: To be druncke^, and
lie tumbling in the streets, is but a pastime, but God grant we pass our
times better, or the Devil will have our Souls: If we can not pass the
times but with such filthy vices, and spend our days in honester order, our
portion will be little, and our patrimony less. Can we not pass our times
as we pay not too dear for our pennywoorthes? in hurting our selves, and in
displeasing our God? and in pleasuring our bodies, to condemn our Souls? Is
this passing the time to? pass pleasure from our selves, and to hinder our
neighbors? and in displeasuring others, not to profit our selves? This
practice is without profit, and these doings without deserts: And a great
number (forsooth) are of this mind, and have this imagination, that to hurt a
man, they have greatly enlarged their credit, when in deed, those that
commend them, is for fear to have the like, more than for good will that he
speaks so much: But oftentimes it falls out, that thinking to hurt his
neighbor, he slays himself: but if he slay the other, and escape unhurt,
then is he in danger to die himself: and if he do escape the hands of men,
the judgments of God are yet to come, for life requires blood: But if he
thus escape, and go away with victory, yet is he not afterward sorrowful in
mind, and pricked in his conscience: but too late commes repentance, when
judgment is passed: yet for civility, our Country hears the bell, and has
the only name, though altogether unworthy, and applied quite contrary to the
demeanor thereof: The time indeed has bin, but now passed long ^ithence,
that for honest civility, and good government, Germany was the only Country:
and where were the noble Gentlemen, but at the Emperors Court? Aristotle
arriving in a certain Country, more to see their usage, than to try their
courtesy, espied amongst other their vices, one not here accounted any: which
was, that they eat twice in a day, but not feasted all ye day as we do: well
(said he) this is not for my purpose, why then should I stay longer? for how
can here be wisdom, where there is so much eating? would he tarry think
you to see our inordinate dyets? no trust me, he would quickly bid us farewell:
for the ba^quetting out of measure, which breeds surfeiting in some men,
that they pay their loving lives for their fine fare: how would he look on our
great bellyed Epicures, whose gut is their God, and whose panch ye saint they
serve: to see the^ all the day eating like greedy Woolues, and swilting til
they can not stand: the day spent in banqueting and gluttony, and the night
torn away in vices, too monstrous to utter, or too loathsome to declare. These
are they which our Savior speaks of, which walk in the darkness, and
sleep in the day: are they not curssed? and will they not be plagued? Is not
the day appointed for labor and travail, the night for rest, and to refresh
a man's weeried spirits: to see the drunken sottes tumbling in the mire, and
wallowing in the cannels, most loathsome to look on, yet not regarded, nor
corrected: not amended, nor reproved: not blamed, nor punished, but laughed
at, and made a jesting stock: Were the laws of the Lacedaemonians so strictly
executed, as they were with them practiced, these vices would not be so common,
but far better looked to: for he that can not be drunken, must be no
Soldier, and he that learneth to drink, takes degree as a Scholar: And
what greater mischief is pretended than in drunckennesse? and what secret is
not manifested in that beastly time? but he that kills a man being druncke,
shall be hanged when his wits are more sober.

Was not Medalia gotten with child by her drunken Father? and was not Ciana
ravished in like manner? was not Noe eas^lye tempted, having lost his senses?
and our Countreyman may part stakes with these Epicures, who could by no
means rauishe his Masters daughter, nor glut his insatiable desire, but
practiced to make her drunken, and brought it to pass indeed, then gained he
his purpose, though she lost her life. Afterward at his own feast he boasted
of his treachery, and bragged of his knauerie, but he blabbed so much in that
mad mood, as he was burnt in his sober estate. After Wine, come wicked words,
mischiefs are manifested, and vile pretenses come to light: never greater
murders committed, then in time of this diuelishe drincking, and never more
thefts, and villainies executed, and why then should we embrace it? and if we
liked it not we should not use it, and in liking it we purchase our own
ruins, and sue our own destructions.

Has not God forbidden so prestri^^ly, and set down so preciselye, that
drunckardes shall not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven? then must we perforce
have Hell for our profession, we must gain the one, and forgo the other: and
if we leese the one, we must of necessitye find the other: And is not a man
ever sorrowful when he has fulfilled that his diuelishe desire? it causes
him to be sick in the stomach, and diseased in the body: spoyleth the wit,
and hurts the brain: alters the favor, and changes the complexion:
breeds the Dropsy in the members, and the Gowte in the feet: And why
should not this suffice us, that we are forbidden by our God? who knows
what is better for our health, then we, what is good for our welfare: has he
commanded us to refrain any thing from the body, but it is pestilente for
the soul? But to make a man druncke is a great conquest, nay, to take away a
man's senses is a maruailous offense: for is not a man then void of reason, and
beguiled of his right rules? is he not merry, though foolish? and mad, though
simple? is he not incensed with frenzy, and furious in his own fancy? is he
not beguiled of his natural members, and deceived in his own imagination? Of
all other filthy factions, this is in my mind, a thing most loathsome: a man
without his senses, what is he better then a beast? nay, not so good as those
creatures, for they always retain that form, which at the first they
inioyed: and man more perfect then all others, and more pure in the sight of
God, to defile his soul with such filthynesse, and to make him self
loathsome, who before was wholesome. This no doubt is intolerable, and hard to
be forgiven: and amongst the rest, this one thing is most vain, for a man to
flatter him self with hope, and to cast those cogitations which prove quite
contrary: Some man thinks with him self, this little portion will I spend,
and such a piece of Land will I sell: this will set me far from debt, and
make me my own man again, where now I cannot walk, or tread the streates,
but one plucketh me by the sleeue, and an other calls me to him: an other
threatens the Law, and an other arresting: the^ that once sold, and not lon^e
after, but I shall be over the boots, where before I was scarc^ to the tops
of my shoes: then a little more to discharge that, and then some more
afterward: so that by a little, and then by more, all will be gone or all
spente away: Then does he flatter himself, either to attain some great
Marriage, or some Master that shall gain him, which he before lost: where
he shall be deceived of the one, and frustrated of the other: for his lyuinge
consumed, who will regard him? and his portion spente, who will marrye him? ^
Woman will reiecte him, for fear he lauishe out hers, in such order as he
laid out his own: As for his Master, he will thus imagine: He that was so
lyberall of his own, will lay out mine more largely. Some other flatter them
selves by wearinge costly apparel, and by layinge all they have on their
backs, thinkinge some Gentlewoman or other will be in love with him, or like
him in such order as he wishes: when (in deed) he shall be hated for his
foolishness, and recompensed with just nothing for his liberality: Others
flatter them selves, that to spend their lyuinges in some Noble man's service,
is a deed of charity, thinkinge his Master will not see him lack, so long
as he lives: where they are as far from the Mark, as they can shoot from
the White: For will not a man's friends forsake him if he be poor? and will
they not fly from him, if he be in miserye? will they not disdain him, if
he seek to them? and will they not reiecte him, if he crave any thing at
their hands? Yes trust me: and why then should a man feed his fancye with
such foolish imaginations, and hope for that which is never likely to happen?
Some others having gained the favor of some good Gentlewoman, think they are
hard by Gods seat, when in deed they are just at Hell Gate: for if she show
but one freendly conntenaunce, or speak but a few fair words, they think
the Goal is won, and the w^ger their own: and this is it that causes the
names of so many honest women to be called in question, where otherwise they
should be clear, and fre from suspicion, by the means of those that will not
stick to say she is their own, and they have her at their call: yet when
they have sued till they are weary, and done the uttermost they can, they are
farther to seek then at the first: and at the last, put clean out of favor
for so lewd attemptes: Every Woman that looks on a man lusts not after
him, and she that gives freendly entertaynement, is not straight at
commaundment: Let not then (Gentlemen) the Court be always your place of
abode, and spend not your goulden years in pleasure, for then your old age
must perforce be without profit: Is it not better to keep a good house in
the Country, then to spend all your time in bravery at the Court? good
hospitallitie is that your poor Neighbors desire, and trust me your good
Prince regards not your brave apparel: To much of any one thing, is not
profitable for any other, and the time passed of your young years, what
follows but crooked age? and who will then like you? or what is she will
love you? No, your Neighbors will embrace you courteously, and give you
welcomes, and guiftes: and who so glad of your freendship? or who will so much
rejoice of your health? There you may raunge the Feeldes, and look over your
grounds: view your Pastures, and behold your Wooddes: look to your Cattle,
and behold your goodly Horses: then the pleasures of the Forrestes, and the
runninge of the Ryuers: the cry of your Hounds, and the flyinge of your
Hawks: all which will cause your old years to be renewed, and serve you a
great deal of money in your purse, which at the Court should be bestowed
upon Physic, and spente in the Appoticaryes Shop: When at Dinner you shall
come home, the Gentlemen your Neighbors will meet you, then arguing upon
this sport, and de^ining upon that pastime: disputinge upon this device, and
reasoning upon that exercise: enqui^in^e of that (...) ^ommendinge that Hawke:
This will revive the dull spirits, and refresh the wearied members: sharpen the
wits, and further the senses: help the body, and discharge the soul of
worse inconveniences: When you come to the Court, you are entertained of a
few your friends at the first, and ever after your courtesy is alike: you see
in one day, that you shall behold always: and no pleasure is new, for that
it is common: There if your finger ache, the Appoticaryes they must pick your
Pocket, and the Physicians must minister all the money out of your Purse: give
you a Glister, that you shall never be good after: and once tasted of
Physic, you must always carry an Appoticaries shop about you, or else
Master Doctor must be ever at your heels: By this means you shall be sure
to be eased of your money, though payned in your body: and if it remedy your
sickness for a time, yet it shortneth your life: and to tell some pleasant
discourse, or lie in the lappes of your Ladies: This is the spendinge away of
your time, and the consuming away of your days: then you must either use the
Cards, or delight the Dice: the one will not lengthen a man's life, but the
other empttie a man's purse: If you have set down with your self yt you will be
a Courtyer, and not any other life you will profess, why yet bridle so your
affections, and set so prestrict an order for your life* as you be neither
pampred in pleasure, nor pined in restraint: Temper so your doings, as you be
not tired with still tarying there, nor weeryed with long absence. When you
begin to grow weerie of the Court, absent your self for a time into the
Country, there shall you find those delights as will increase your desires,
and make you more earnest to stay. When you begin to loath the Country,
repair again to the Court, so shall your imagination be, you are come into ye
second Palace of Pleasure: and always as the one waxes tedious, repair to
the other, which shall not seem troublesome. Thus with renewinge the one you
shall love the other: and with vsinge both, never ^e weary of any: For let a
man always be used to the brauest banquets, and ^yeted with the finest fare,
and he shall loath the one, and hate the other. Is not Wine most excellent to
him that tastes it but seldom? and sweet meats have best savor when they
are eaten but at sometimes? the greatest pleasure that a man uses in this
World, in time seems troublesome, but let a man diet himself unto it, and
then it is most delectable.

Thus Gentlemen, you see him that was sometime your fellow Courtyer, now
resolved to dye a Citizen, and as I used the Court for a time, so mean I now
to use my Books for ever. You willed me to write, and I have fulfilled your
desires: so none be offended, I am passing well contented: and if any be
gauled, I am not a little grieved: yet he that conceyueth any offense, let him
not straight seek for revenge, but stay my return to the Court, then will I
answer at the full, and resolve him every doubt, then shall I be content to be
cut by the Crown, or to yield and cry creake: mean while, make no words of
your received gratulation, for denial shall be a trial sufficient for my
purgation: yet use me as you list, and deal with me as best pleases you, as I
was your faithful friend, so will I not be your everlasting enemy, and as I
once found your favor, so will I not forgo your freendship: try me and
prove me, then trust me, and use me: for the wind may so turn, that I may
visit you, but expect not my coming before you see me present: I wish you no
worse than I would my self, but commend me to you with affection, not the
least, but from the farthest part of my heart: resting always at your
commands, and being pressed to do you any pleasure (...) ^^deuer.

^^^ewell.

The Authors Conclusion.
I Have ended the second part of Narbonus, a work unworthy to be scanned
of the wise, and too waywarde for worn wits, but thrust forward with this
hope, that as sauce procures appetite to a weak stomach, so a toye sometimes
delights a sure Student. Maruayle not then I beseech you that this Tree
yielding the first fruit bare but Crabbes, which serves but for Verges,
which if it be not bitten with the blastes of backebiters, and scorged with the
Sun of unshamefastness, may by the end of Summer give that which shall be
more pleasant to the ^oung, and more profitable in taste: but if the blastes be
loathed, the blossoms shall not be liked: for though the one be in your
hands, yet the other are in my hold: and if you like not the color of the
Feathers, you shall never taste the caruing of the Foul.

FINIS. A.S.
