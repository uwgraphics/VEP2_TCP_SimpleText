A supplicacion unto mast Camel,
PLease it your maship, good mast Camel,
To hear a poor man, his tale for to tell,
And though you be, a man of great debilitie,
Deny not to hear, a man of low ability,
And I sire you, to take it, for no presmountacion,
For yche ha be brought up, after vnrude facion:
Sir, now chyll show ye, the matter and the case,
why cham com to speak you, and like your fair face,
There is one Churcharde, that has you spleasar done,
And ych am com to sire ye, to be good master tone,
But it was vnleudly do, and after an homly sort,
So fair a beast as you ben, to tyen up so short:
I pray you holden scused, it was but, for lack of nourter,
For cham sure, hannot be^, past. vii or. viii. yer a courter
It Was but blockshly y do, of one so vnbase as he,
To spout with such a gemman, of so hie a peti degree:
Yer of a sturdy stock, for your fader nere raisd his farms
Nor nere sold his lands: for ych herd an hasard of arms
Blase all the aunciall proditours, of your old axeltrie,
which com from old housen, of much inpossibilitie,
And many vpstaunciall men, were brouded in that nest,
But your mother in her arms (he said) bare a byg best:
Beseech ye good mast Camel, give ore and leave your fume
and chil be bound that Churchard shan no more so parsume
But if he be so sedgious, to written an other, when,
Bum fay chyll treat no more, do withen what ye can.
Your daily Belman, at your mau^dement, Good man Gefferay Chapel, of
whipstable.
