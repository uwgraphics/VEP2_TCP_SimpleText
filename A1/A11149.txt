For a Funeral Elegy on the death of HVGH ATWELL, Servant to Prince CHARLES,
This fellow-feeling Farewell: Who died the 25. of Sept. 1621.
SO, now He Is down, the other side may shout:
But did he not play fair? held he not out
With courage beyond his bone? Full six years
To wrestle and tugge with Death? the strong'st fears
To meet at such a Match. They that have seen,
How doubtful Victory has stood between,
Might wonder at it: Sometimes cunningly
Death gets advantage: by his cheek and eye
We thought that Ours had been the weaker part:
And straight again, the little Man's great Heart
Would rowze fresh Strengh, and shake him off awhile:
Death would retire, but never reconcile:
They to it again, again; they pull, they tugge;
At last, Death gets within, and with a hug
The faint Soul crushes. This thou may boast, Death,
Thou Have thrown him fair, but he was out of breath.
Refresh thee then (sweet Hugh,) on the ground rest;
The worst is past, and now thou have the best:
Rise with fresh breath, and be assured before,
That Death shall never wrestle with thee more.
Oh, had thou, Death, (as Wars and Battles may*
Present thee so) a Field of noble Clay,
To entertain into thy rhewmie Cell;
And thou would have it be presented well,
Speak thy Oration by this Man's tongue;
Amongst living Princes It has sweetly sung,
(While they have sung his praise:) but if thy Court
Be Silence-tyde, and there dwells no Report,
Lend it to Life, to store another Flesh;
We miss it here, we will entertain't afresh.
EPITAPH.
Here lies the Man, (and let no Liars tell)
His Heart; a Saints; his Tongue, a siluer-Bell:
Friend to his friend he stood: By Death he fell:
He changed his Hugh, yet he remains At-well.
Will. Rowley
