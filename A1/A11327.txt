A treatise concerni^ge the power of the clergy / and the laws of the Realm.

Cu^ priuilegio regali.

The (...)
THough the pri^cypall intent of this present treatise / be to speak of the
power of the clergy / and of the laws of the realm: Yet for asmoche as those
powers can not perfytly be known / but the power of kings and princes be
known also. Therefore diverse textes of Scripture / concerning kings and
princes be put into three of the first Chapitres of this treatise / with the
English following the same / for them that understand not the latin tongue. And
the.ix. chapter also / treats much of the power of kings and princes / and
also of the clergy / and whether the gospel took any power fro princes that
they had before the coming of Christ / or not. The other Chapiters concern
most specially the clergy / and the laws and customs of the realm / as to
the reders will appear.

Auctorities to prove that kings and princes have their auctoritye imediatly
of god. And that honor and obedience ought to be given to them. The first
chapter.
PEr me reges regnant / et legum conditores iusta decer^unt. Pro. viij. By me
kings raygne / and makers of laws dyscerne things that be rightwyse.

therefore ye kings and understand: learn ye that be iuges of all parties of
the world: lay to your ears ye that rule the multitude and order the people:
for power is given to you of god. Sapi. vi. Reges ge^tium dn^antur little. Luc

resistit potestati dei ordinationi resistit. Qui autem resistunt ip^i sibi
dampnationem acquirunt. etc. Nam principes non sunt timori boni operis sed
mali. etc. Vis autem no^ timere potestatem / bonu^ fac and habebis laudem ex
illa / dei enim minister est tibi in bonum / si autem malum feceris time non
enim sine causa gladiu^ portat. ad To. xiii. There is no power but of god.
Forsooth all things that be / be ordained of god. And so he that resysteth
power / resysteth the ordinance of god. And they that resyst get dampnacyon to
them self. For princes be not ordained to the dread of a good work / but of
evil. Wylt thou not dread power? do well and thou shalt have laud of it. He
is the minister of god into goodness to the / and if thou do evil / dread /
for he bears not a sword without cause. Subiecti estote of humane creature

/ and all the people thereof / from the farthest end of Egypt to the extreme
part thereof. Except the lands of the prestes that were given unto them by
the king / to who^ also suffycient meat was given of the comen barnes / and
therefore they were not compelled to sell their possessions. Et constituit

according to the constitutyon of David his father ordained the office of
prestes in their ministrations and leuytes in their order that they should

that it should be / and they break nothi^ge of the kings commandment neither
ye priests nor the leuytes in all things that the king commanded. Rex

among ye jews as it appears.i. Match. vii. and.x. and.xiiii. The first
question the.iiii. Cha.
WHether the statute made in the.xlv. year of king Edward the.iii. that is
commonly called ye statute of Silua Cedua / be against the law of god or not.
The.iiii. Chapter.

An answer to the said first question
THe statute of Silua Cedua whereof mention is made in the said first question
stands well with the law of god / and ought in conscience to be observed /
as well by the clergy as by the people in this realm: and these be the causes
that move us to say so: We think that the payeng of the.x. part of wode
above.xx. year can not conuenyently serve for the susteynau^ce of ye spiritual
minystres / for they must yearly and daily be sustained / and the profyt of
that wode may happily not come in an hundredth year or more / for the wode shall
grow as long as it shall please the owner / and therefore when our lord
(Leuitici.xxvii) appointed to the jews / whereof tithes should be paid / he
appoi^ted not that any tithes should be paid of the trees / but of ye fruits
as there appears. Another cause is this. Though the people be bound by the
law of reason and also by the law of god / to find to their spiritual
ministers a reasonable portion of goods to live with / yet that the people
shall pay precysely the tenth part to their spiritual ministers in name of
that porcyon / is but by the law of man. And therefore if the tenth part in
any country suffysed not for the minysters / the people were bound to give
them more. And according to that / that is said before / speaks John^ Gerso^
in a treatise that he names Regule morales / where he says thus.

Solucio decimaru^ sacerdotibus est de iure diuino quatenus clerici inde
sustententur: sed quota^ hanc vel illam assignare aut in alios redditus
co^mutare positiui iuris existit.

That is to say / The payenge of tithes to prestes is by the law of god so
that they therewith may be sustained / but to assygne this porcyon or that / or
to change it into other rentes / is by the law posytyue / that is to say / by
the law of man. And sith the tenth part is by the law of man / all custommes
and prescripcyons of payment of tithes in name of the tenth part ought to be
observed / so that the spyrituall ministers have suffycient (...) / and the
said statute is no farther / but that a prohybicyon shall lie where a man is
sued in the spyrituall court for tith of wood above the age of.xx. years by
the name of Silua Cedua / as it has done in time past. and though tithes be
called spyrituall / yet they be in deed temporal: as all goods be i^ whose
hands soever they come. And so the parliament has full power to order them /
so that the law of god be not broken by their order. And it is not to think
that the ki^ge and his lords spyrituall and te^porall and the come^s that were
at that parliament would have been so far over seen / to have made a statute
against the law of god / and if it be said that the tenthe part among the
Jews in the old law / was a law of god / and that therefore it ought to be
observed / among christian men as other moral laws be. Yt may be answered /
that payeng of the tenth part for tithes is no moral law / and therefore it
cessed when the passion of Christ was fully preched and known among the
people as other Iudicyalles and Ceremonialles did. And therefore if it were
prohibyted / that it should not herafter be lawful for any man / to say that
the said statute is against the law of god. It is very like that it should
cause great quyetnes herafter between the Curattes and their parysshons in many
places in this realm.

The.ii. question. the fyth cha.
wHether the Iuges in spryrituall courts be bound in any case to take
knowledge of the kings laws / and to judge thereafter or not.

The fyfth chapter.

An answer to the second question.
IF any questyon or doubt rise in the spu^all court concerni^g the right or
possessyon of any temporal thing / and whereof they in the spyrytuall court /
after the custom of the realm may hold ple. The iuges there are bound to
judge the right to him that has right by the kings laws. As if a man have
two sons / one borne before espousels / and another after: and he bequeth to
his son and heir an hundredth pound / they in the spyrituall court are
bound to judge the hundredth pound to him that is heir by the laws of the
realm. Also if a man have a porcyon of tithes in another parysshe / so long
time that it makes a prescryption in the spyrytuall court / but not in the
laws of the realm. He has no right to that porcyon, for like as a law made
by the Clergy / that one curate should have a porcyon of tithes in another
parysshe were void. So is a prescription void that is grounded only by the
law made by the Clergy / against the prescryptio^s of the law of the realm.
And in the law of the realm there is no less prescryption / tha^ fro the
time whereof no mind of man renneth to the contrary. Also if a man by his will
byqueth certain money or goods to a monk / that by quest is void in the
laws of the realm. And so they in the spyrituall court ought to judge it.

The.iii. questyon the syxt cha.
WHether it be against the law of god to arraigne prestes before lay me^ or
not. The.vi. cha.

An answer to the.iii. question.
AS to the very auncye^t grou^des of the come^ law of this realm prestes
should be put to answer before the kings justices: as well in actions real
and personal / As i^ felonyes murdrers and treasons / as farforth as any lay
men should be. Nevertheless / by a contynuall pretense that the clergy have
made that it is against the law of god that clerks should be put to answer
before lay men / or their bodies arested. They have had great favor in
such things / more than lay men have had. Howbeit wha^ they have had such
favor / they have natte taken it as a favor of the king or his laws: but
as a thing which they ought of right to have by the law of god. And thereupon
they have at many parliame^tes made pretense to have more liberty in that
behalf than the comen law and custom of the realm has given them / and
more than lay men have had. And to cause the matter more plainly to appear I
shall recyte so^e statutes that have been made in diverse parlyamentes in time
past / concerning the pretense of the clergy therein. First in the statute of
Marlebrygge in the.lii. year of king Henry the third. It is inactyd thus. If
a clerk be arrested for any offense belongyng to the crown and after by the
kings commandment he is let to bayll or is repleuied. So that they to whom
he is taken to veil shall have him before the kings justice. etc. That they
to who^ he is taken in bail / nor his other pledges shall not frothe^sforth be
amercyed / if they have his body before the justice though he will not or may
not answer before them / for the priuylege that he is a clerk / by which
statue it appears that before that statute clerks were arrested for offenses
against the crown and it appears also that clerks clamed their priuyleges
than / as they do now / but the Statute does not afferme or allow that they
ought to have it. For the statute was not made to that entente / but it was
made only for the indempnytie of the pledges / that though the clerks in such
case would not answer for trust of their said priuylege / that yet the pledges
should bear no loss thereby as some men take it that they should have done by
the law / but the priuylege of clerks was left in dout as it was before. And
prestes were put to answer before the kings justice after that statute as
they were before / and so continued the varyaunce / until the treatyce of
Articuli cleri was made / which as it is said is a statute / and was made in
the.ix. year of King Edward the.ii. at which time the Clergy made many
artycles of certain grefes done / as they said to the church of England /
whereby is understand the clergy of England whereof one was that though a
clerk ought not as they said to be iuged before a seculer judge / ne any
thing to be done agai^ste him whereby he might come to the parell of death.
Nevertheless / they said that seculer Iuges make clerks yt fle to churches
and there knowledge their offenses to abjure the realm / and admit the
abiuratio^s for that cause / though they be not their iuges thereupon. And so
said they that there was given to lay men an indyrecte power to punysshe
clerks if they come into the realm again. To this co^plainte the seyde
treatise answers thus / and says. A clerk fleeng to the church for felony /
to have the defense of the church / if he afferme him self to be a clerk:
shall not be compelled to abjure the realm / but yeldynge himself to ye law
of the realm he shall enjoy the liberty of the church / after ye laudable
custom of ye realm used i^ time past. And it seems yt by this word Clericus
in the said treatise is understand only a Clerk that is within ordres / and
not every clerk that can read. And than it appears farther by the said
treatise that if he will have the defense of ye church he must confess the
felony / for the seyde treatise is / that he submyttynge himself to the law
of the realm shall have the lybertye of the church. And by the law of the
real me he must confess some felony before he have that lybertye.
Nevertheless because this article has not ben seen / but seldom i^ ure it
has be^ a doubt to many men whether the Corowner shall be judge i^ that matter
himself / or whether the Corowner must send him to the kings justice / and
than they either to commytte him to the ordynarye or to remytte him again to
the sent warye as they think ought to be done by the law. But I suppose that
i^ this case the Corowner is the judge. And another complaynt that the clergy
made at the making of the said treatise called Articuli Cleri was this. They
said that though the conusau^ce made before him that is not judge of hi^ that
makes the conusau^ce holds not / nor suffyseth not to make process / nor to
give sentence upon. Nevertheless / they said that some seculer Iuges admytte
the accusation made by clerks by way of approuynge or appelle / though they
be not of their iurisdyctyon as they said. But reteyne such clerks / that
confess before them their own enormyous offenses: as theftes / robbories and
manslaughter / and deliver the^ not after to their p^lates though they be
thereupon suffyciently required. Ne though before the^ for all their own
confession they may not be iuged ne condemned without brekynge of the
liberty of the church. To this complaynte the said treatise answers thus:
To an apprower asked by thordynarye in due form as a Clerk / the benyfyte nor
the lybertye of the church shall not be denied. By which complaynte and
answer made thereupon / there seems to appear two things / one is / that the
Clergy pretended that the confession of a clerk made before a seculer judge
for murder or felony byndeth not. The second is that they found them grieved /
that when clerks made such confessyons / and thereupon approved other for the
Kings advantage as they might do by the law. That than though the
ordynaryes came and asked them as clerks / that yet the iuges would not
deliver them. And that was true as the ordynaryes said / because they that the
clerks had appealed / might offer to join battle if they would / which
trial by the law might not be taken fro him that was so approved. And as to
that article the said treatise assented to the request of ye clergy and
granted that he should be delivered to the ordynarie when he asked him. And so
by that treatise the ioynynge of battle is taken fro the appelle. But as for
the first article / that is to say that seculer iuges should be no iuges to
clerks / the seid treatise regarded it not / but left it as it was before.
And after this varyaunce / thus contynuynge without accord / clerks were
contynually put to answer before the kings justices as they were before. In
so much / that as well seculer clerks as chapelaynes / and monks / and other
men of relygion were drawn and hanged by the awarde of seculer justices / as
appears by the recytall of the statute made in the.xxv year of king Edward
the third. Pro Clero the.iii. chapter / which the Clergy said was to the
great prejudice of the fraunches of holy church / and to the oppressyon of ye
Iurisdyctyon thereof / wherefore it was accordyd and granted by the king in
his said parlyament / that all manner of Clerks as well seculer as religiouse
yt should be frothe^sforth co^uycte before justices seculer for any manner of
treason or felonye touching any other person tha^ the king or his royal
majesty should have and enjoy freely from thens forth the preuyleges of the
holy church of England / and shall be without impechement or delay delivered
to ye ordinary when they demand the^. And thereupon the Archbisshoppe of
Caunterbury / promised that such couenable ordinances should be made for the
sauegarde and chastysement of the said clerks / so that none should herafter
take any boldness to offend for defaut of chastisment / and so it appears
that the intent of the king and of his parlyament at the making of the seyde
statute / was / that in treason or felonye touching the king / they should
not have the preuylege. And in the chapyter next following / it is ordained /
that clerks that be arrayned before seculer Justices / the which challenge
their clergy / and be demanded by the ordynaryes / shall be forthwt delivered
unto them without delay. And before that statute sometime the iuges would
remaunde clerks to prison / saying they had other things to say unto them.
And that is prohibyted by the seyde statute / and after in the fourth year of
king Henry the seventh. It was enacted that a clerk which was not within
ordres and had his clergy / shlude be burned upon the left hand / in such
manner as by the seyde statute appears. And that if any person at the second
time that he is arrayned demand his clergy by cause he is within ordres /
and has not his letters there / nor thordynaryes certifycat that than the
justices should give a day by their dyscretyon to him / to bring in his
letters or certifycat / and if he fail thereof at that day / he to be put fro
his clergy. And so by that statute it appears that if a clerk that is not
within ordres be brenned in the hand / and than be made a priest / and be
after arrayned of felony and than he says that he is with in ordres / but he
has not his letters nor any certyfycat of thordynarye / wherefore he has a
day to bring them in / according to the said statute of Anno quarto. And at
the day he faylleth thereof / that he shall be put fro his clergy / and thereof
must needs follow / that though he be with in ordres / he shall be put in
execuco^n. And furthermore it is not like that there was any sufficient proof
showed at any of the said parlyamentes that it should be against the law of
god / that priests should be put to answer before lay men. For it is not to
presume / that so many noble princes and their counseyle / ne the lords / and
the nobles of the realm ne yet the Commons gathered in the said parlyamente /
would fro time to time / run in to so great offense of conscience / as is the
brekynge of the law of god. And if there be no suffycyent proof / that it is
against the law of god / than the custom of the realm is good / to put them
to answer upon. And than is there great defaute in all the clergy / that so
depely has resysted the seyde custom upon a surmyse that is not true / ne
can not be proved. And where diverse spyrituall men have in time past made
pretense as well in open sermons / as in other co^munycatyons / that it is
against the law of god to put priests to answer before lay men. And for
proof thereof have laid this text.

Nolite ta^gere christos meos. p^. ciiii That is to say / Touch not my
anointed / which they apply only to prestes. It is apparent that it is no
lytteral exposycion / for after the letter of the said text. It may as well be
applied to kings / yea / and to every christen man / as to prestes.

And after saint Augustyne / and saint Hierome / there is no sense of
scripture suffycyente to prove an argument but only the lyterall sense.

The.iiii. question the.vii. cha.
WHether any of the constitucyons prouyncyall be against the kings laws and
his p^rogatyue or not And of what effect the exposycion of master Lynwode upon
the seyde constitucyons is of, The.vii. cha.

The answer to the.iiii. question.
IT is no dout / but that diverse of the constitutyons prouyncyall / and also of
the Legantynes of Octo and Octobon / be dyrectely against the kings laws and
his prerogatyue / which can not be here conuenyently rehearsed. And than it must
needs follow / that the exposycyon made by master Lynwod upon the same / is
against the king and his prerogatyue. For upon a feeble foundacyon can not be
set a stable buyldinge / wherefore it were right expedyent / that the said
co^stitutio^s and legantines so being against the king and his prerogatyue.

And the seyde expositions also: should clearly be prohybit and rased out of
the books / so that the young men that shall herafter set them self to
study the Canons / shall not be disceyued thereby hereafter as many have been
in time paste.

The.v. questyon. The.viii. cha.
WHether the treatise that is called Circumspecte agatis / and that is set
among diverse statutes of this realm as a statute / be a statute or not.
The.viii. chapter.

An answer to the.v. questyon.
THe treatise that is recited in the.v. question that is called Circumspecte
agatis / is recyted in a constitucyon prouyncyall / which is in the second
book of the constytucyons / and begins: Circumspecte agatis and infra / in
manner word for word as it is contained in ye said treatise / that is taken
for a statute among the learners of the laws of the realm / which also
begins Circumspecte agatis / and it is recyted in the said Constytucyon
that is was taken out of the kings answers. But we never saw any proof that
it was so. And there be in the seyde treatise diverse things that be directly
against the laws of the realm: as it is in this poi^te. That prelates for
fornycatyon / auoutrye / and such other: may sometime assygne bodily pain / and
sometime pecunare pain. And the law is / that prelates shall never assign
pecunary pain for correction of sin but only at the desire of the party. And
also it is recyted in the seyde treatise / yt if the prelate of any church /
or his advocate ask of a person a pencyon / that the suit should be in the
spyrituall court / and the law of the realm is even to the contrary. And we
think that if it had been a statute / that the law should never have been used
therein so directly against the statute as it has been used. And in the.xix.
year of king Edward the third in a writ of Annuyte brought in the kings
court against the said article of the seid treatise. It is said that the
seyde treatise is no statute / but that it was named so to be by the prelates.
And also the seyde writ of Annuytie / is iuged to be mayntenable in the kings
court / and that is dyrectly against the seyde treatise of Circumspecte agatis
/ wherefore we think it is no Statute.

The.vi. question / The.ix. cha.
WHether ki^ge Lucyus that was the first christen king of the Bretons / in
this realm / or king Ethelberte that was the first christen king of
Englysshmen / had any less auctorite and power over their subjects after
they were christened than they had before when they were paynymes or not.
The.vi questyon / The nynth chapter.

An answer to the.vi. question.
WE never saw cause why king Lucyus or king Ethelberte recyted in the seyde
syxte Questyon should have any less auctorite over their Subjects after they
were Christened than they had before when they were Paynymes.

Howebeit truth it is that after they and their people were converted / they
might not compel their people to forsake the christen faith which they had
received ne to do any thing against the christen faith / but that was no
bondage unto them ne abatynge of their power / but a great lybertye and fredome
in god. Whereby they and their people were delivered fro ye bondage of
infidelity yt they were i^ before their conversion. 1. And if any man will
say that the power of Princes should be abatted by the words that our lord
said to his discyples Mat. 18. What so ever ye bind upon earth shall be bound
in heuyn / and what so ever ye lose upon earth / shall be losed in heaven: And
that by those words his disciples and their successors should have power to
make laws / whereby princes and their subjects should be bound / and that
therefore the power of princes after the coming of Christ was abated even by
the law of god. To that it may be answered that holy scripture is not to be
expounded only after the lytterall sense of the text / that it is written in
/ but after other textes of scripture concerning the same matter. And they to
be so construed and declared / that there be no co^traryositie in them / as
undoubtedly there is not / if they be well and truly understand. And according
to that saying there is a text construed. Luc. vi. that says. Et qui aufert
que tua sunt ne repetas. That is to say / If any man take fro the that is thine
/ ask it not again. And if that text should be only taken according to the
sense of the same text without any further decleratyon thereof / than all
property were put away / and laws and justice concerning goods should
nothing be regarded / whereby the hole commen wealth should be distroied. And
therefore that it was not thentente of our master Christ / that the seyde
words should be so understand / it appears by the words that he said.

Mat. xix. Non facies furtu^. Thou shalt do no theft. And in that he
prohybiteth theft / whereby is understand generally the unlawful taking
away of our neighbors goods. It appears that when he speak the seid words
/ Luc. vi. that his meani^ge was not that it should be laufull to take away the
goods of his neighbors / ne that he that they were taken fro ought not by
justice to ask them again. But rather that his words should give occasyon to
him that the goods were taken fro / to prepare himself to suffer the wrong
as in his heart / and to do no more for the reuengynge of the seyde wrongful
taking, than should be expedyent to reform him that did the wrong / and to
fear other that they should not do like offense. And to that intent charity
will that the owner shall ask his goods again. Also when our lord said to
his Apostles. Luce. xxii. (Judas than being one of the apostles) I have
ordained to you as my father has ordained to me / the kingdom of heaven / that
ye shall sytte upon my table in my kingdom / iugynge the twelve Trybes of
Israel. And it can not be taken that our lord mente that the kingdom of
heaven was ordained to Judas. For John^.xvii. He called hi^ the son of
perdicyon / and therefore the words that our lord spoke in that text / were
to be understand of Matthias thappostell who^ our lord knew should be
chosen in the place of Judas / and he that takes those words to be
understand of Judas / as well as of any other of the apostles is far
deceived. Also the same text what soever ye bind. etc. to one intent / is
construed according to thentent of the maker / that is to say of our master
Christ / and not only according to his words for his intent was that such
authority as he would his disciples should have thereby: should go to their
successors to the end of the world / and yet his words streche only to the
apostels self. But for asmoche as he came to make a law and Testamente that
should continue to the end of the world. It is convenient to think that his
words shall be taken according / for if his words should be taken to streche
only to his dyscyples / than by their death / his words had been determined /
and that had been a thing of a small effect / for coming so far as he came
/ and for sufferyng so great pain as he suffered: It is no doubt therefore but
that his words in that behalf shall be taken to streche to their successors
/ and than sith his intent shall be construed more largely than his words
streche unto as to the contynuaunce of their auctorite / why than shall not his
intent be construed more strayte than his words sound unto / for declaryng
what auctorite he would his discyples should have especyally concerning the
power of princes / seeing that he has declared his intent him self / as it
shall appear hereafter yt he has done / for declaration whereof it is to be
considered that there be diverse auctorityes of Scripture / whereby it appears
that our lord never intended by his coming in to this world to take any
power fro princes / but that they should have like power over their subiettes
after his coming as they had before and that may appear thus. He said Luce.
xx. Reddite que sunt Cesaris Cesari. Et que sunt dei / deo. That is to say /
give ye to the Emperor that is his / and to god that is his. And he also
paid to the Emperor tribute and what power ente^ded he to take fro the
Emperor that paid him trybute / he also refused to deuyde the inheritance
betwyxt the.ii brethern / saying to them / who has ordained me to be deuyder
betwyxt you. Math. xxii. As if he had said though I have power to do it: yet I
am not come to execute ye power / but go ye to the Emperors laws that be
ordained for it / he said also Io. xviii. Regnum meum non est de hoc mundo.
That is to say / my kyngedome is not of this world / as who says though I be
a king / and that the grettest king that ever was / and might take all power
from kings and princes if I would / yet I come not to execute that power /
Christ also refused to be a king / and so by all his deeds he showed plainly
that he came not to be a king ne to take away any power fro princes that lived
in pouertye hi^ self / so far unlike to princes / and sith every deed of
Christ is an instruction to every christen man. It must needs be so most
specially to his apostels before all other to i^structe them that they shall do
as Christ did: And furthermore to prove that the meaning of Christ was not
that his appostels and discyples should take any power fro princes by any
thing yt he had spoken to the^ of before: He said to his appostles after his
resurrection thus. Accipite spiritum sanctu^ sicut misit me pater et ego mitto
vos. Ioh. xx. Take ye the holygost as my fader has sent me / I send you. And
certain it is that the very intent / why Christ was sent by his father into
the world next to our redemption / was to teache and preche the truth / and
to fulfill the will of his father in meekness / pacyence / sufferaunce / and
such other / and to enduce the people through his example and doctrine / to
dispyse this world / and to desire the world to come. And to the same intent
Christ sent his appostles / as appears by the seyde words / and not to be
like princes or to take power fro princes / but only to order things
concerning their ministraco^n / as to appoint in what bred and wine the
sacrament of the auter shall be consecrated and such other. Also it appears.
Act. xiii. that the holyghost appeared to the ministers at Antioche as they were
ministri^g to our lord / and dilygent in fasti^g. And commanded them to
send Saul and Barnabe / into a work that he had appointed them to.

And it appears in ye same chapter that the work that he appoi^ted the^ to /
was to preche Ihesu the son of David to be ye savior of the world / and how
he was gyltlesse put to death buried / and rose again the third day. And who
can think but that their successoures were sent to the same purpose as they
were / and not to take upon them many powers and auctorities that many of them
have used in time past. And if it be asked to what intent Christ than speak
those words. Quodcumque ligaueritis. etc. If he meant not that his disciples
should thereby have power to make laws to order the people / for he speak
nothing without cause. It may be answered that he gave them authority thereby
/ to separate evil men for their offenses / fro the co^munyon of the good
people / and to commau^de the good people also to eschew their company / and
to make absolution thereof again. etc. which be great powers and may do great
good if they be charitably put in executyon. But if they will declare the seyde
text / in such manner that they should thereby take power fro princes which
Christ left unto them / or to exalte their own power more than Christ gave
unto them. Than princes may resyst their declaration theri^. yea / and ar
bound to do it / and there princes ought to be iuges taking such of the clergy
unto the^ as they shall think conuenyent. whereof undoubtedly there be right
many that will not be blinded with such worldly honor and vanyte. And so it
seems that the said text / Quodcumque ligaueritis. etc. shall be taken
specially according to theffecte of the other auctorities before rehearsed: and
not only according to the lytterall sense of the same text.

Also though some men have said that our lord gave to his discyples both
powers. That is to say.

Spyrituall and temperall / when the apostles said unto him (Luc. xxii.) Lord
/ here be two swerdes / And he answered: That is enough And that he should mean
thereby that he would that they should have both powers / for if he had not meant
so / he would not have said of the.ii. swerdes / It is enough. But it is to
much. And that therefore princes have had sithe that time their temporal power
of the spyrituall power. To that it may be answered / that those words were
never spoken of those two powers / as the letter of ye said gospel plainly
declares: For the letter is this. Our lord a lyttel before his passion /
said to his discyples thus: Wha^ I sent you with out secke / scryppe / or
shoes: did you want any thing? And they said nay. Than he said unto them.

But now he that has a secke let hi^ also take his scryppe. And he that has
no sword / let him sell his cote and bye a sword / for I say to you: that it
behooves that that is written of me shall be fulfilled. Et cum iniquis deputatus
est: that is to say: he is accounted among wyked men: And than he said
further: And truly tho things that be written of me be nygh at an end to be
fulfilled: And than they said / lord / lo here be two swerdes / and he said
unto them / it is enough. And Lyre which treats princypally upon the
lytterall sense of Scripture / says that tho words were spoken by our lord
to instruct his discyples / that sometime it is lawful for a man to defend
him self moderatly from persecutours / and that therefore the Appostelles being
at that time well couraged to defend them self / regarged more tho words
that our lord spoke of the swerdes / than they did either of their seckes or
of their scripbes. And therefore they answered / here be two swerdes / and than
he knowing that it was the will of his father that he should suffer death for
redemption of man: said: it is enough. As though he had said / those two
swerdes suffyce and be enough to defend me fro death as well as many thousand of
swerdes should do / for I that according to ye will of my father will wylfully
suffer death for man look for no defense of swerdes. This seems to be the
intent why he said of the two swerdes / it is enough / and not to sygnyfye
thereby that thappostelles should have both powers spiritual and temporal / and
if it should be taken to be meant so, it should not be by a litterall sense / and
after Saint Augustyn and saint Hierome / it is only of the lytterall sense of
holy scripture that a suffycient argument may be taken / and so we think
those words to bear but a small effect any thing to abate the power of
princes. And where some me^ have said that the clergy have auctorytie by the
gospel to here all causes that should be showed unto them by any manner of
complaynt: and that that should appear by the words that our lord said. Math.
xviii. If thy brother offend the correct him between him and the only / And if
he here yt thou have wone thy brother / and if he here the not / take with the
one or two wytnes / and if he here the not than / than show it to the church
/ and if he here not the church / let him be to the like an Ethenyke and a
publycan / and that in somoch that the gospel co^mmaunded to show the offense
to the church / and shows not in what cases that it shall therefore be
understand in all cases / and that because it is said / show it to ye church
/ that it was mente thereby that it should be showed to the clergy: To that it
may be answered that by that word church is not understand only the clergy
/ for they vndoutydly make not the church / for the hole congregation of
Christian people makes the church: And because the hole people of christe^dom
can not be gathered together / so that they may have such matters showed unto
them all: therefore it can not be taken that our lord meant yt it should be
showed to all the people / for he commanded nothing but that may well and
resonably be observed: And therefore when it is said show it to the church. It
is to be understand thereby / that it shall be showed unto the^ that by the
law and custo^e there used have auctorite to correct that offense And therefore
he that in this realm will give charytable monycyon to his neighbor that
offends in such a thing as the king by his laws and custom of his realm
may lawfully punysshe / and he will not yet amend. Wherefore he shows it to
the king or to his iuges / or to his justices of peace i^ the country / or
other officers that after the law and custom of the realm may reform it. He
has therein right well fulfilled the gospel. And if the offense be of such
things as by the custom of the Realm be called spyrituall: As it is of
auoutry / fornycation / and such other / whereof the clergy may hold ple. And
thereupon because ye party that he has given monicyo^ to / according to the
gospel / will not amend / he shows it to the ordynary or to his officers. We
think that he has also right well observed the gospel. But to say that ye
said words (Dic ecclesie) should take any power fro princes that they had at
the coming of Christ / or that they have had sith that time by the laws and
customs of their realms and countries. We think that the seyde words do
nothing amount unto it. And furthermore it should seem to make a repugnauncy
in scripture. If it could be proved that our lord gave authority to his
appostles and discyples to make laws / that should take any power fro kings.
For it is said. Psalm. ii.

Et nunc reges intelligite erudimini qui iudicatis terram. That is to say. O
ye kings understand ye: and be learned that judge the world: by which words
it appears that kings judge the world. And how could that be true if the
appostles and discyples of Christ and their successoures should have auctorite
to make laws generally to bind princes and their people: And scripture is
always true. Also it is written.

Sapienc.vi. Rex sapiens populi stabilimentum est. That is to say.

A wise king is the stablenesse of his people: By which words it seems that
it must of necessyte follow that kings have also power and auctorite to stable
their people. For wisdom without power can not stable the people. But how can
any king either by power or wisdom stable his people / if the clergy have
power to make laws to bind him and his people / onles that he should be taken
as judge over those laws wherefore we think that like as kings and princes
before they were cristened / had power to order their people after the law
that they than were of / and had power to avoid all such things: as might
bring any unquietness among their people / that so the same princes after
they were converted to the christen faith / had as full power to keep their
people in peace and quyetnes as they had before they were cristened. And that
they may avoid althynges that might break their peace or bring unquietness
among their people / by what occasyo^ so ever it should happen to rise / so
that they offe^de not the christian faith that they have received.

The seventh question. the tenth Chapter.
IF a king that is an infydele would offer to be converted to the christian
faith / and to receive all the artycles of it / with all his people. But he will
not that his Subjects should be bound to break their labor / ne to keep any
holy days but only the Sunday / Ne that his subjects should be be bound to
any laws made after their conuercyon / but only by such laws as should be
made after the order and custom of his realm whether he ought to be received
to the faith with those condicyons or not. The tenth chapter.

The answer to the.vii. question.
THe answer that is made to the syxte questyon / shows suffyciently and
plainly enough how this seventh question may be answered. For if the Clergy
have auctoryte by the law of god to make holidays / and also to make laws to
bind princes and their people / tha^ there may be none that will be of
christ's faith that shall refuse them / For every christen man must specially
profess to observe and keep the law of god. But if the clergy have made
holidays and laws by a fre consent and agreement of princes and of the people
/ or by grant of princes / and not by the law of god. Tha^ may such a
king that is vncrystened / and desires to be crystened refuse all those
holydaies and laws For they be not made by the immedyat auctorite of the law
of god / But the Sunday / all christian men be boude to keep holy by example of
our lord / which in the seventh day rested from all works that he had made.
As it appears. Gene. ii. And yet we suppose that the Sunday that is now used
among christian men / might be changed to another day in the weke by princes
and their people / so that one day in the weke be kept as a day of rest / for
prayer and contemplacyon. For it is but by the law and ordinance of man that
the Sunday is kept on this day as it is now kept among christen men / for
among the jews it was kept on the saturday Nevertheless our meaning is not
that it were good to have the Sunday alteryde to any other day in the weke /
for ye day that it is now kept on seems to be the most convenient day that
can be appointed for it.

But our intent is to show how the Sunday is by the law of god / and how it
is by the law of man. And as for all other holy days they be but ceremonyals
brought up by the deuotyon of the people / through the good ensample of their
bysshoppes and prestes / which undoubtedly lived a blessed life / in fasting /
prayenge / and contemplacyon / in the bygynnynge of the church / more purely
than lay me^ did / so farforth that princes seeing the grace and virtue that was
in them / were contented to suffer them to do many things concerning the good
order of the people / which they might have done themself if they had list:
but princes have not al way accounted ceremonies concerning the ordering of
the people / to be of such weight as they have been in deed: but have holden
them as small matters which have been very weyghty and therefore they have
suffered the Clergy to order them whiles they have benne busyed in weyghtyer
matters for the common wealth as they have thought / though it have natte always
ben so: for many ceremonies be ryt much to be regarded and many persons have
benne punysshed for brekyng of them as grievously as if they had offended
against the law of god and sometime more / and there upon in process of time the
people have thought that the clergy have ordered such ceremonies and made
laws theruppon by their own power and by the immedyat auctorytye of the law
of god / where it has not ben always so in deed / but they ought in many cases
to have put the princes and their people in mind to have done it / and that is
the very duty of a watchma^ to put the rulers of the cite in mind what
things be like to be dangerous unto the city / and thereupon to be callers on
that remedy may be provided before the danger come. But ye clergy by such
suffera^ce (as before appears) have taken upon the^ to order such things as
by their own auctorite / and that has caused much people to dread them and
their laws more than their princes / whereby the power of princes to the^ given
by god / has greatly decayed and ben but little regarded / and by this
sufferaunce the clergy have extended their power upon the people very
grievously where upon great grudges have risen in many places among the
people: wherefore now that such grudges be known princes be bounden to know
their own power and omyttynge other things that be not for the time so
necessary for the commonwealth / ar bound also to put to their hands for
reformacyon / and not to cesse till they have brought such matters to a good
q^etnesse. And as for other holidays / if the multitude of the^ be thought
hurtful to the common welthe / and rather to increase vice than virtue / or to
give occasyon to pride rather than to meekness / as parauenture the synodales
and pertyculer holydaies have done in some places / the parlyament has good
authorite to reform it. But as for the holydays that be kept in the honor of
our lady / the postles / and other auncye^t saints / they seem right
necessary and expedyent to be co^tynued / though they be not merely grounded
by auctorite of the law of god. Thus we think that such a prince as would be
converted to the christen faith may refuce any of the ceremonies and laws
made by the Clergy in time paste / and yet be received to the principal
artycles of the christen relygyon.

The.viii. question. The.xi. cha.
IF a man auowe to offer a horse or any other thing to a saint before a
certain image / whether that auowe must upon pain of restytucyon be
performed quycke or ded / or not. The.xi. chapter.

An answer to the.viii. question.
IF a man have auowed to offer a horse or any other thing to a saint / before
a certain Image. He that has the profet of ye offeri^ge there / has after
the laws of the realm no property in the thing so auowed till it be offered
in deed. For after the laws of the realm / such a vow is but as a nude
contracte / and is void to all intentes / as to the law / if it be not
performed.

But if it be offered to the saint according to the auowe. Than he that has
the profet of the offering has good property in it. Howbeit if the party
live we think it is expedyent that he make his offering in fulfyllynge of his
auowe / unless he have an urgent cause to let him that he may not do it.
And if he have such a reasonable cause / than it seems that he may turn it
to some other good deed after his devotion / for the law by^^eth him natte to
any restytucyon. And in likewise it is / if a man without having. Quid pro
quo. promise to give another.xx. pound at a certain day that promise in the
law of the realm is also void / and is called in ye law a nude contracte /
and none accyon lies upon that promise.

Ne the party is not bound in conscience to fulfill the promise without he
intended to be bound by his promise when he made it. But if he upon the
promise made an oath that he would perform it / than we think he is bound in
conscience to parforme it in saving of his oath whether he intended to be
bound by his promise or not / though he be not bound thereto by the law: But
to say that restitucyon must be made in this case to him that has the
profit of that offering / is but avayne saying. And the people would be
plainly instructed therein / to thentente that if any such case should happen
hereafter / that no man should think him self bound in conscience to
restytutyon where he is not bound to it. And so to have a grudge in co^scye^ce
where it needs not.

The.ix. question / The.xii. cha.
IF the writ of Excomunicato capiendo were put away by parlyamente. Whether
the keys of the church were any thing offended thereby or not. The.xii. chapi.

An answer to the.ix. questyon.
IF the writ of excomunicato capiendo. That is commenly called a Significauit
/ were put away by parlyamente / the keys of the church were nothing thereby
offended. For if the clergy make an excomunication / and the party
excommunicate will not obey it / but obstynatly stand in his malice / the
clergy by virtue of the keys has no auctorite to imprison him thereupon / ne
to compel him to any penance / ne to proceed any farther by their own power.
But than it has been used by a lawdable custom of the realm in mayntenau^ce
of good order and virtue among the people / That if the bishop certifye the
king that such an excomunicat person has been accursed.xl. days and will
not be iustyfyed by the censures of ye church / as they call them / that than
the king of his special grace shall dyrecte the said write of Excomunicato
capie^do to the sheryffe where the party dwells co^maundynge him thereby to
iustifye the party by the body until he have satysfyed ye church / both of
the contempt and of the wrong. etc. And so it appears that the grauntyng
forth of the said writ of Significauit depends only upon the power of the
king and of his laws and not upon the i^mediate power of the clergy.
Therefore though it were prohibyt the power of the clergy remained hole unto
them as it did before. Nevertheless our intent is not to prove that it
were good to put away the seyde writ of Significauit. For it is right good and
conuenye^t to be used when the case requires. But our intent is to have it
known that the power of the grauntyng of the said writ depends upon the
said custom and laws of the real me / and not upon the power of the Clergy:
so that the Clergy may the rather parceyue what great favor the king and
his laws has borne to the spyrituall Jurisdiction upon trust that they have
had / that the spyrituall Iurisdyction will so effectuously give eye unto ye
truth that none of the kings Subjects should be unjustly grieved by such
exco^munications. But if it should happen the people to be ouermoch grieved
thereby. Than should the king and his parlyamente be bound in conscience to
provide remedy in that behalf / as should be thought expedient for the good
piece and quietness of his subjects.

The tenth question / The xiii. chapter.
WHether the article of ye statute of Carleole that treats of the comen
seals of houses of relygyon be a statute or not. And if it be a statute / why
it has not be put in executyon. The.xiii. chapter.

An answer to the.x. questyon.
THe article of the Statute of Carleole that treats of the comen seals of
houses of relygion is a statute / as the other chapiters in the said statute
of Carleole are. And we think ferther that two things have caused the said
statute not to be put in execucyon / whereof one is this. The words of the
statute are so uncertain of them self that the judges could not by the word /
of ye statute judge by order of ye law what was the veraye meaning of the
makers thereof for though it seem that their meaning was to provide remedy for
the save keeping of the comen Sealles of houses of religion / and that like as
the come^ Seals had been in time past in the keeping of the Abbot or Prior or
other soueratn only. etc. that it should be fro thens forth in the keeping of
the Abbot or prior. etc. And of.iiii. of the most dyscrete brethern of the said
coue^t: Yet nevertheless / the statute is that it shall be put into the keeping of
the said four brethern under the private seal of the Abbot / and so the
words that follow after in the statute / yt is to say / so that the Abbot or
Prior of the house may in no wise make a contracte or obligacyon by him self /
be voyed and of none effect / for natwithstandynge that the comen Seal be in
the keeping of the four brethern unto the private seal of Abbot: Yet may the
Abbot make a contracte or obligacyon / as well as he might have done before the
making of the seyde statute. And so the vncertainte thereof is one cause why it
has not ben put in executyon. There be also diverse other statutes / whrein the
mi^de and intent of the makers / were not so plainly declared / that the iuges
after the order of the law might judge upon them / till they were more plainly
declared and interpreted by parlyament. For none may interpretate a statute
but the parlyament only. And one of the statutes that were in themself
uncertain for the Iuges to judge upon is this. It was inacted in the seventh
year of king Richard the second the.xv. chap, That no man should carry /
armor corn / vytayll / nor other refresshement into any party of Skotlande on
pain of forfeyture. etc. And for because Berwicke which is in skot land was
not excepted i^ the statute though it were than as it is now in the Kings
hands: yet it was thought that the goods carried thy there were forfeyt. And
the Judges would not take upon them to enterprete the statute otherwise than
the express words of the statute warra^ted the^ to do. Wherefore in ye.xv.
year of his reygne it was declared by perlyament. That it was not thentent of
the seyde first statute / that they that carried any vytayles to Berwycke
should run therefore i^to any penalty of that first statute. Also a statute
was made in ye.viii. year of king Henry the.vi. whereby it was ordained yt the
chusers of ye knights of the parlyamente should be of the same countye / and
have lands to the yearly value of.xl. shyllynges over the reprises. But the
statute said not expressly that the chusers should have lands to the yearly
value of.xl shyllynges within the same shyre / wherefore some men were of an
oppynyon / that if he dwelled in the same shyre and had.xl. shillynges yearly
in another shyre that it sufficed / and some other thought the contrary.

And that like as the entente of the makers of the seyde Statute was that such
an elysour should dwell within the same shyte / that their intent was that he
should also have lands within the same shyre.

And finally the matter was showed in the parlyament in the tenth year of king
Henry the syxte / where it was inacted. That every chewser of the knights of
the parlyamente should have.xl. shillinges of freholde within the same shyere.
And so we think that one cause why the seide statute of Carleole was natte
put in executyon / was the uncertainty of the words of the statute. And
therefore / if it were yet declared and made more certain / we think it were a
right good deed. Another cause why the seyde statute was not put in executyon /
we suppose to be this. That is to say / that abbottes and other spiritual me^
in tho days pretended that it was not in the power of the parlyament to order
such spyrituall matters / as they thought the keeping of the comen seals in
spyrituall houses was / and that therefore / they were under the pretense of a
more clear way in consyence encouraged ye iuges to suffer the said statute to
lie unexecuted / and what so ever the occasyon thereof was / the truth is / that
the seyde statute was never yet put in execucyon. But if the statute were
plainly declared and put in execucyon herafter: it should seem to be a right
expedyente act / for the well ordringe of many relygyouse howses within this

IF a man be accursed for dysobeyenge of any of the constytucyons prouyncyall
or decres that be against the kings laws and his prerogatyue / what danger
he renneth in by that excomunicacion. The.xiiii. chapter.

An answer to the.xi. questyon.
IF a man be accursed for dysobeynge of any of the constitucyons prouyncyall or
decres / that be against the kings laws and his prerogatyue / or for any
cause whereof the suit parteyneth to the kings court / the excommunicacyon is
not suffycyente in the laws of the realm / ne a significauit lies not in
such case if the truth of the matter appear to the king / and if the
bishop certifye the excommunicatyon to the king / and shows not the case
thereof. And thereupon the excommunicate is taken by a significauit and put in
prison / and than he by his friends shows the matter before the king in his
Chauncery / the party ought thereupon to be delivered out of prison. And if
the bishop will in nowyse assoyle him when he is delivered out of the prison
he offends against the king and his laws right grievously for denyenge the
absolucyon.

The.xii. question / The.xv. cha.
WHether the kings Court be put out of iurisdictyon for tithes by the law of
god or by custo^e of the realm. The.xv. chapter.

An answer to the.xii. question.
THe people be bound by the law of reason and also by the law of god to give
unto their spiritual mynysters a suffycyente portion of their goods to
sustain them with: But that the spiritual mynysters should have the.x. part
in the name of ye reasonable portion is only by the law of man and by a
custom of the realm. And therefore if that.x. part were not suffycyent in any
place for a reasonable sustentacion of the spiritual mynistres the people were
bound to give them more. And if it be to much and over grievous to the people /
the parliament may moderate it. But than though a reasonable porcyon be due to
the spiritual mynystres by the law of god as is said before yet that the suit
shall be taken for that reasonable porcyon in the spiritual court if it be
denied is only grou^ did upon a favor that the kings of this realm and the
hole realm have in time paste borne unto the clergy / for though the porcyon
be due by law of god: yet it were no thing against the law of god though
the suit for the porcyon should be taken in ye kings court: And paraue^ture
it were the more indifferent wey if it were so / for now they be both judges
and parties / but as for the tenth part it is much more stronger that the suit
might be taken in the kings court with out offendyng the law of god: and so
we think that the kings courts be put out of iurysdyccio^ for tithes by a
custom of the realm and not by the immediate power of the law of god: And
that it is so / it may more plainly appear thus / long after that the kings
courts of his Benche and Comen place / and also other inferiall courts were
put out of iurisdiccyon for tithes: Yet nevertheless writtes of Scire facias
were comenly sued in the Chauncerye for tithes / and the defendauntes were there
upon put to answer / wherefore at the petycion of the clergy / and in
co^syderation of a dysme that the clergy granted to the king it was enacted
in the parliament holden at westminster in the.xviii. year of king Edward the.iii.
the last Chapter that such writtes of Scire facias should not fro thensforthe
be granted for tithes / and that the process than depending upon such writtes
should be void / and that the pertyes should be dysmyssed before seculer judges
of such manner of plees / sauinge to the king such right as he and his
ancestors have had / and of reason ought to have / And by reason of this
statute no suit may be taken in the Chauncery for tithes / but only by the
kings patentes / and therefore if it were ordained by parlyament that the suits
for tithes should here after be taken in the kings court. The parlyament ought
to be obeyed therein / as well by spiritual men as by te^porall. How be it we
will not fully afferme that it were good so to have it ordered / for as long
as the spiritual iurisdyction will order the suits thereof there according to
right and good indyfferencye / it is sufferable that the suits be taken there
for tithes herafter as they have been in times paste. But if they use them self
in such percyall manner / that the people have just cause to complain of the
parcyalyte / tha^ shall the parlyame^t be bound in conscience to look
dylygently on the matter and to see it reformed. Also it is only by the custom
of the realm / that diverse things be tried by the spyrituall court and not by
the kings laws: as it is of this Issue. He is a monk professed or not
professed / dereyned or not dereygned / admytted and instituted or not admytted
/ able or not able / Bygamus or not Bygamus / plain or not plain. All these
Issues and many other may sometime be tried by the ordynary / but ^arte always:
for if such matters be pleded in abatemente of the writ / or that such matters
be aledged i^ them that be strangers to the ple: or if disabylyte be aleyed in
one that is deed: or if the ordynarye certifye that he in whom professyon is
aleyed / is exe^pted from his iurisdyction. It shall be tried even as the law
is now / by the kings laws. And tf it were enacted that it should be so in all cases / the law af god were nothing offended thereby. Howbeit we say not
this: to thentente it should be so enacted / but that we think it conuenyent
that the clergy should know that they have that power by the favor of the king
and of his realm by reason of a special trust and co^fydence that the kings
of this realm / and the hole realm have had in the ordynaryes in time past.
But if they mysordre them self therein / and refuse to obey the kings laws /
or claim that power only by the laws of god / so that it may in no wise be
taken fro them / where it is natte so in deed. Than as it seems good charity
would that to give the^ the more occasyon of mekenes / that they should know
the power of the king and of his parlyame^t therein. And it is no dout but that
the parlyament may with a cause take that power fro them / and might also have
done likewise before it was recognysed by the parlyame^t / and by the clergy
that the king was the heed of the church of England / for he was so before
that recongnicion was made: as all other christian princes be in their own
realms over all their Subjects spiritual and temporal.

An answer to the artycles contryued in the said.xiii. question.
WE think that all the said artycles be either against the kings laws /
orels that they be of non auctorite in this realm. And therefore whosoever in
this realm order their conscience after the determynacyons of the seyde so^mes
mentioned in the said.xiii. questyon / and by the auctorite of the said sommes
we think they err in conscience. And we think ferther also that it is very
like that so^me spiritual men in ar by treme^tes and other cou^selles / and
also in their iugementes have been disceyued thereby in time past. And that it is
very like that many of them will be so / till a plain declaracyon be made
thereupon / according to the laws of the realm.

And the danger is such / that they that give sentence according to ye said
artycles or any other that be against the law of the realm bind the^self
thereby to restituco^n not only of the thing in varia^ce / but also of all the
costs and damages that the pertye shall sustayn by occasion of ye same.

The.xiiii. question. the.xvii. cha.
WHat should cause the highest come^ wealth now in these days

The.xvii. chapter.

An answer to the.xiiii. question.
THe highest come^ wealth that could be now in these days were this. That al
kings and princes would fall to a loving pease and concord together / and
that they would than consider what high power and auctorite they have received
of our lord over his people / and how strayt acco^pte they have to make
therefore herafter / and that they would thereupon with all dilyge^ce fro time to
time put that power in execucyon to the honor of god and wealth of the people.
And that they specially by such counsel as they shall think most disposed to
say the truth.

Have this verse which is written. Psalmo.ii. Et nunc reges intelligite
erudimini qui iudicatis terra^. And this text. Rex sapiens: populi
stabilimentu^ est. which is Sap. ii Plainly and truly expounded and declared
unto them / and dilygently to follow the same. And certain it is that he that
said. My delight is to be with the sons of men / would not have his people
live out of order / ne be blinded with darkness of ignorance. And if the
said textes be well understand / it will appear thereby / that the high
judgment is in princes / and that it lies in princes to appease all
varyaunces and unquietness that shall rise among the people / by what
occasion soever it rise spyrituall or temporal / and it will appear thereby
also / that the kings grace has now no new auctorite by that / that he is
confessed by the clergy / and auctorised by the parlyame^t to be the heed of
the church of England. For it is but only a declaracyon of his first power by
god committed to kynglye and regal auctorite / and no new grant. and that
for all the power that he is the heed of the church / that yet he has none
auctorite to minister any of ye sacraments / ne to do any other thing
spyrituall / whereof our lord gave power only to his apostles and discyples.
And because princes have not here tofore commenly ben learned of them self to
know their own power in all things to them committed by god. It is therefore
expedyent that they have true / just and indyfferent counseyle / as well
spyrituall as temporal / the which as minysters under them / may fro time to
time declare their power unto them / and put them in mind what is expedyent
to be done for ye common wealth: setting always truth before their eyes / with
ye faith and obedyence that they are bound to bear unto their prince /
specially concerning the power and auctoritye that he has received of god /
for mynistracyon of Justice unto his subjects / and for keeping of them in
peace and quietness.

Of diverse auctorities and reasons / whereby many have pretended in time past /
yt the clergy should have both powers / yt is to say spu^al and temporal / with
answers to the same reasons. The.xviii. chapter.
The first reason is this.
OVre lord said to his discyples. Math. xviii. Quodcumque ligaueritis super
terram erit ligatum et in celo. Et quodcumque solueritis super terram erit
solutu^ et in celo. And than they say that he that gave the^ auctorite to
bind and lose all thing / gave them auctorite to make laws of all thing:
And laws of al things can not be made without power / as well spyrytuall as
temporal. etc. wherefore they say it must needs follow that the clergy has
both powers.

The second reason.
ALso the apostles said to our lord. Luc. xxi. Here be.ii. swerdes / and he
answered that suffysith. And than they say / that by these two swerdes are
understand both powers / that is to say spu^all and temporal. And than they
say farther / yt if our lord had thought those powers to much for his
apostelles / that he would not have said of the two swerdes / it suffysith /
but it is to much.

The third reason.
ALso it is said. Mat. xviii. If thy brother offend the / correct him
between him and the / and if he here the / thou haste won thy brother: and if
he here the not / take with the one or two witness. And if he here the not
than / show it to the church / and if he here not the church / let him be to
the as an Ethnyke and a publican. And than they say that by those words: show
it to the church / is understand the spyritualtye. And that / in that it is
said / if thy brother offend the. etc. and shows natte in what offense /
that it is understand of all offenses Spyrituall and Temporal. etc.

The answer to these.iii. reasons before / appears in ye.ix. chapter of this
book.

The fourth reason.
ALso it is written. Primo ad Corinth ii. Spiritualis autem iudicat omnia et
ipse a nemine iudicatur: That is to say / A sprituall man judges all things
/ and he is iuged of no man. And tha^ they say / than he that may judge al
things has power as well spirytuall as temporal. etc.

An answer to this.iiii. reason.
The words of the Appostle in this place ar of this effect that the
spiritual man / that is to say / a man that follows the judgment of the
spirit / Iugeth all things as they be: That is / things worldly to be but
vain / disceytfull / and of short abydyng / and things gostly to be sothfast
/ true / and always abydyng. And over that for the more clear understanding of
this text of the apostel. It is to understand that by this term spu^all / is
not understand spiritual men after the comen use of spekyng / whereby all of
the clergy are called spiritual men. For it is no doubt but that many of the
clergy are more worldly and more carnal than many of the lay men be. And it
is natte against the perfeccyon of the hole clergy / though they confess that
some of them be so. Ne it stands not with charity / that if any man will lay
abuses in so^e of the clergy / that they should therefore conjecture or make
other to conjecture yt he that so does loves not prestes / or hates their
ministraco^n and there wylbe no parfet unite as long as the clergy will rather
fi^de defaute at them that speak of such abusyons in the clergy / than to do
that in them is to reform them / and so by that term spu^all that the apostell
speaks of is understand a man that lives after ye spirit / as is said before.
And therefore he that takes the text to be understand / that a spyrituall man
shall judge all thing taking by that term spiritual / the clergy takes it
clear contrary to the mind of the apostell. etc.

The fyfth reason.
ALso it is written.i. Corinth. vi. Nescitis quia angelos iudicabitis / qua^to
magis secularia That is to say / Know ye not that ye shall judge angels /
how much more shall ye judge seculer things. Whereby some of the Clergy have
said that the clergy ought to judge seculer things. For they say that the
said epistle was written to the clergy at Corinth. etc.

An answer to this.v. reason.
The words of the apostle that are recyted in this, v. reason / were spoken to
all the cristians at Cori^th and not only to the clergy there: as it appears in
the first chapter of the said second epistell to the Cor^. For it was made
to his discyple.

Tymothye. Et ecclesie dei que est Corinth. That is / To Thymothy and to the
church of god that is at Corinth. And by that term: The church of god at
Corinth / is understand the hole congregation of the faithful people at
Corinthe / and that they all shall judge angels. That is to say / that they
shall approve ye sentence of god given upon angels good and bad / as every good
christian man shall. And not only yt the clergy shall do it. And therefore they
that take that text to be spoken only to the clergy / take it contrary to
the text / and also contrary to the mi^de of the appostell. etc.

The.vi. reason.
ALso Gene. i. it is said / god made.ii. great lyghtes: The son yt is the
spiritualtye / that it should govern the day / that is to say things
spu^all. And the moon that is the Emperor or the king / that it should
govern the night. That is to say / temporal things But the moon has no
light / but of the son. And no more has the king or emperor but of the
spyritualtye. etc. And therefore they say that the clergy have both powers /
The one in possessyon / the other in right. Howbeit that they have committed
the ministracyon of things temporal / to temporal men,

An answer to this.vi. reason.
That exposicion whereby the spiritualtye is compared to the son / and the
temporaltye to the moon in the said.vi. reason / is no lytterall exposicion /
and there is no sense of scripture suffycient to prove an argument by but only
the lytterall se^ce. And so that.vi. reasone is of small effect to prove that
the clergy have both powers / for it may as lightly be denied as affermed.

The seventh reason.
ALso Theodosius the emperor enacted / and Charles confermed it: That who soever
had any varyaunce and would put it to the judgment of the bysshoppes. etc. That
anon without any doutynge it shall be sent to the judgment of the bisshops.
ex. de iudiciis. Ca. nouit.

An answer to this.vii. reason.
Though Theodosius enacted and Charles confermed it / that who so ever had any
variaunce and would put it in judgment of the bishops / that anon without
doutyng it should be sent to the judgment of the bysshoppes: yet that grant is
of none auctoritye in this realm for the kings grace here knows no
superior under god: And therefore for hi^ lies no appeal. And over that / if
the kings grace made such a grant to his bishops in this realm / that they
might hold ple of Temporal things / the grant were void. for it were
against his laws. And furthermore we know no auctorite to prove that the
seyde Emperors made the said grant and confyrmaco^n but only the recytall of
the seyde law made. ex. de iudicus. Ca nouit. And that seems not suffycient
to bind the Emperoures / ne their successors / onles their assent could be
proved by other suffyciente matters of record.

The.viii. reason.
ALso it is said Deutro. xvii. If any thing be hard and doutfull to the:
bytwext blood and blood / cause and cause / leprye and leprye / and thou see
the judgment variant bytwext the persons / thou shall come to ye prestes of
the Leuytycall kind and to the judge that shall be that time / which shall
show the the truth of the judgment / and thou shalt do what so ever they that
be there in the place that our lord has chosen: say / and thou shall follow
their sentence / and than they say that sith prestes in the new law be of no
lose auctorytie and power tha^ priests of the old law were etc. that they
ought to have no lose auctorytye and power than the other hade / but rather
more.

An answer to this.viii. reason.
It is no dout but that the office and ministracyon of the prestes of ye new
law are more notable and more worthy than the office or ministracyon of ye
prestes of the old law were: For they were i^ a derknesse these in the light.
They in figure / these in truth of the thing fygured. And therefore for the
highness of their auctoritye in spu^all things / the judgment and ordering of
temporal things is the more vnconuenyente for them. And for that cause it was
that the apostels said. Act. vi. It is not mete for us to leave the word of god
and minyster to ye tables. And since the appostles thought that the ministracyon
to the tables / though it were a right charitable deed / was unmeet for their
office which stood specially in preaching and teching and in prayer and
contemplacyon / and other ghostly counseyls and ministracyons to the people.
How far unmeet is it tha^ to their successors to take upon them as it were a
deed of high perfectyon / to judge betwixt cause and cause / title and title /
as well of lands and tenementes / as of goods and catales. yea: and sometime
of things concerning the life of man. Therefore the same reason that is made
to prove yt because the auctorytie and power of prestes in the new law / is
no less tha^ the auctorite and power of the prestes of the old law was / and
that therefore they should have as much auctorite to judge betwyxte blood and
blood / cause and cause / leprie and leprie as the other had / makes right
strongly against the^. And further it is to be noted that in ye seid text of
Deu. xvii. It is not said only that the party shall come to the prestes of
ye leuytycall kind / but that he shall come also to the judge that shall be
that time / but whether that judge must be of the leuytycall kind or not it
does not appear. etc.

The.ix. reason.
ALso in this matter in has be^ said / that Emperors at ye beginning had
some right in the Empire / but for their si^ne that they did against holy
saints / and that specially agai^ste the high bishops they were depryued of
the right of ye Empire / and that the right thereof was translated unto the
church / for he deserves to lose his privilege yt abuses the power to him
committed, xi. q. iii. Ca. priuilegium.

An answer to the.ix. reason.
Emperors had title to the Empire of the immediate gift and ordinance of god
long time before the coming of Christ / and it appears not that ever Christ
took that power from them. And though so^e of them mysdemeaned themself
against holy saints / and that specially against the high bisshoppes. Yet why
they / or their successoures should therefore lose the right of the Empier which
was given to them of god. There is no reason / for though some of the^ were
evil / the successoures might be good: as undoubtedly many of them have been.
And some time an evil man is suffered of god / for the proof of good men /
and over that admytte that they were worthy to be deprived for their offenses
fro the right of the Empier Yet why that right should be translated to the
church / it will be hard to prove it by reason. For as for to the law that
is aleyed for ye proof thereof. that is to say.xi. q. iii. Ca. Priuilegiu^.
That he deserves to lose his privilege that abuses the power to him committed
/ proves nothing that it should be translated to the church / taki^ge by
that term church / the bishops and clergy. For it is no dout but that the
emperors received not the emprye of ye Clergy / wherefore it seems yt that
reason is but of little strength to prove yt both powers / yt is to say spu^al
and te^peral should be in the clergy.

The tenth reason.
ALso it is said. Psalm. lxxi. Deus iudicium tuum regida et iusticiam tua^
filio regis: iudicare populum tuu^ in iusticia et pauperes tuos in iudicio.
That is to say / O lord god give thy judgment to a king / and thy justice to
the son of a king: to judge thy people in justice / and thy poor folk in
judgment. And tha^ this reason has been made thereupon / that these words were
spoken lytterally of christ as they were in deed / as a prayer yt the father of
heaven would give his judgment and justice to Christ. And they say as the
troth is / that that power was fulfilled i^ Christ: as it appears. Ioh. v.
Where it is said. Pater omne iudicium dedit filio. The father has given all
the judgment to his son. And also christ says himself. Mat. xxviii. All
power is given to me in heaven and in earth. And than this reason is made
further. That that power yt christ had he never gave to emperors or kings /
but to his discyples / when he said to them. Quodcu^que liga. etc Wherefore
both powers spu^all and te^porall sith the time of christ has been in his
appostels and discyples / and in their successors.

An answer to this tenth reason.
It is no dout but that all power was in Christ / in heaven and in earth / both
of bodies and souls / lands and goods / life and death. But it is as little a
dout but that Christ never gave all that power to his apostels nor discyples /
ne yet he gave not to the^ all the power that was in him concerning the
ministracyon of the sacraments / whereof he committed a right high power unto
them: as to minister any of the sacraments but in due matter / as in water /
bred / and wine or such other / as he might have done him self: Ne yet he
never granted power unto them to do miracles by their own power / as he him
self did. And sith he granted not to them power to mynyster the sacraments
but in due matter / which if he had done / it had not dymynisshed the
perfeccyon of their ministracyon / but greatly enlarged it. It is not to think
that he would give them power over such things / whereby they should be the
more unapt and unable to use the spiritual ministracyon to the people that he
had given unto them: as is the medelynge with temporal matters and temporal
busynes. And how great perell and danger has comen thereby / as well to the
hurt of their own souls as of the souls of many other / no man knows but
god alone. And for as much as it is very like that spyrituall mynysters will
not freely remove them self fro such Temporal power and Temporal business.
All christen princes are bound in conscience as well for the health of the
souls of all spirytuall mynysters as of all other people that they have taken
charge of / to remove the occasyons that have caused them to set theymselfe so
fully to the medelynge of Temporal things as many of them have done in time
paste.

The.xi. reason
Our master Christ said to his lxxii. discyples. Luc. x. He yt he rech you /
hereth me. And upon these words this reason has been made / that for as much
as our lord speak the seid words generally to his disciples / to whom all
prestes be successors: and showed not what time / ne wherein they should be
herd / that his words must therefore be taken to be of this effect / that he
would that his disciples and their sucessours should be herd and obeyed as
well in things spyrituall as temporal / whereof it must needs follow that
they have both powers / That is to say spyrituall and temporal.

An answer to this.xi. reason.
It is to be understand / that the same time that our lord speak the feyd
words to his discyples / he se^te them forth to preach in to every cite and
place where he should come: and at that sendynge forth he said to them on this
manner: The heruest is great: the workmen be few: pray ye the lord of ye
heruest that he se^de workmen in to his heruest: Go ye forth. Lo / I send you
as lambs in the mids of wolves / Bear neither secke / scryppe / nor shoes /
and salute no man by the way: In what house so ever ye e^ter first say / peace
be to this house / and if the son of peace be there / your peace shall rest
upon him / and else it shall return again unto your self: In ye same house
abide ye / eating and drinkyng such as they have. Truly the work man is worthy
his hyre / go not fro house to house, And into what cite soever ye enter and
they receive you / eat that is set before you / and cure the sick folks that
be in it / and say unto them / the kingdom of god shall draw nere unto you.
And i^ to what cite soever ye enter / and they receive you not / ye shall go
i^to the streets and say. Lo / the duste that cleueth to us of your cite we
cast upon you. Nevertheless know this / that the kingdom of god draws nere.
And tha^ after certain words that he speak to them concerning such cities
as would not receive the^ / he said the words before rehearsed / He that hereth
you / hereth me / whereby it appears that his meaning was to have the people
here his discyples when they preached such things as he commanded them to do
/ that is to say. That the kingdom of god drew nere / as if he had said.
When ye preach that I commanded you to preach / and as I my self do preach
of the kingdom of heaven / and use your self as lambs among the people /
than he that hereth you / hereth me / for ye speak in me / and I in you. And
tha^ also all they that hear you and follow your teaching shall have as much
reward as if they had herd me parsonally and followed my teaching.
Furthermore it is not like that the meaning of our lord was by those words
that his discyples should have both powers spiritual and temporal: for if he
had intended so, he would not have sent them forth so poorly as he did
without secke / scryppe / or shoes / and bydde them live of their prechynge.
The effect therefore of the seyde words is this. That wha^ preachers preche
the gospel truly unto the people and declare under what manner ye ki^gdo^ of
heaven may come unto the^ / yt they be tha^ reuere^tly and devoutly herd. But if
they pretend to have by that text or any other: more worldly honor power / or
richesse / than our master Christ left unto them / than the people ar not
bound to obey them in that pretense.

Of abusions and defautes in the clergy / concerning the laws of the realm.
The.xix. chapter.
First / it has been a great defaute in diverse of the clergy that they have
reported and affermed in time paste / that the statute made in the.xlv. year of
king Edward the third / concerning the tythi^ge of wood that is commonly
called the statute of Silua cedua / is against the law of god. And that yet
now that some questyon has of late ben moved thereupon / none of them
endeuoreth him self to prove it is so / ne yet to have the matter set in a
good clear way: but as it seems force little / though the matter rest still
in varyaunce as it has done before: and if it be so suffered to continue /
great varyaunce will follow thervpo^: for the one law will that the tyth wode
be paid / and the other law clearly prohibyteth it.

Also it has been a great defaute in many of the clergy / for that they have
made pretense in time paste / as well in open sermons as in other places / that
it is against the law of god / yt prestes should be araygned before lay men
/ and that yet they have not endeavored themself to show any suffyciente
auctorite to prove yt it is so / and clearly to stable the realm in that
behalf / but rather show the^self content that the matter should continue in
varyaunce / as it has done in time past.

Also it has been a right great default in many of the clergy that seeing that
they have made pretense openly that it is against the law of god / that
prestes should be arraygned before lay men / and that they have yet openly
preched and taught / yea / and executed it in deed openly before the face of
the world / that if a preeste be degrated yt than he may be put in execucyon:
For though he be degrated he is a pressed as he was before / because the carecter
is indelyble. And so that pretense of degratynge seems to be none other / but
an illudyng of the truth. And that the bishops would bring the matter to that
point / that such prestes as they would have arreygned before lay men should be
arreygned / and that none other should.

Also since the knowledge of the laws of the realm is in many cases necessary
to all men in this realm for the clear orderyng of conscience and for gyuynge
of true counsel to the people: It is a great defaute in many of the clergy /
that they have endeavored themself no more to have knowledge thereof tha^ they
have don And what inco^uenye^ces have come thereby / no man can tell: for by
that occasyon ignorance has been preferred before knowledge / as well in
outward courts / as in the secret Court of the soul.

Also it has been a great defaute in many of the Clergy / that they have
pretended / that it has not ben conuenyent for lay men to treat of the power
of the clergy / ne to reason what be the keys of the church / ne to touch
the power of the maki^g of their Canons / or to treat which be reasonable and
which not: for that right specially belongs to princes and their counsel to
look upon: for if they should be driven to believe the judgment of the clergy in
things concerning the honor / power / and iurisdyccion of the clergy
against their own / they might happily be disceyued: for the more power that
the clergy has in temporal things the less is the power of princes / and
therefore they yt be learned in the kings laws / ar specially bound before
other to know the power of the king and of his parlyament. For how can they
know that the law that they have learned is to be ministered among the people
/ If they know natte whether the king by whose auctorite it is ministered /
have power to command the ministracyon of it. Also he yt knows not yt the
parlyament of England has power by ye hole church of England can not fully
know the power of ye parlyament. Furthermore no man can know the power of the
king and of his parlyame^t: but he know the power of the clergy. For it is no
dout but that such power as the clergy has by the i^mediat grant of Christ
/ the king ne his parlyame^t can not take it from them though they may
order the manner of the doing. What an abusyon is it tha^ in the^ that would
make the lerners of the laws of ye realm believe that it is not conuenyent for
them to search / ne know what is the auctorite of the clergy: for the
authority of kings and of the clergy be so lynked together in many things /
that the one can not be known / but the other be known also: And yet as it
has been reportyd / many right notable men have been brought to that belefe in
time past. Moreover it is no defaute in lerners of the law to pretend
ignorance in high doutes of scripture that parteyne not to the learning of the
law / but to p^tende ignorance in the power of ye king and his parlyament or
of the clergy which be the things that most specially parteyne to the
approuynge or dysaprouynge of yt they have taken in hand to learn is great
defaut. And furthermore / since diverse spu^al men have taken upon the^ to reason
whether lay me^ have power to assygne what cloth shall be laid upon a deed
corse at his buryall / and what candelstyckes and other things shall be set
about hi^ / and what not. why should not leye men / and specially those that be
learned in the laws of realms and countries search whether the reasonynge and
determynacyon therein proceed upon an indifferency and according to the troth
or upon a synguler couetice of them self / and if they ought not nor mi^t not
do so / tha^ might the clergy happily bi^de lay me^ to that they ought not to
do in many cases. Nevertheless we think not yt all the hole clergy be fallen
into these defaultes before rehearsed: for we doubt not but yt there be many of
the^ that have their eyes fully set open unto the troth: ne yet we think not
that any of the clergy now living be in the full defaute of the said abusyons:
for many of them were bygonne by their predecessors before their time / and
therefore if they will herafter endeavor the^ self with good dilyge^ce to help
yt the defaultes which were first bego^ by their p^decessours may be reformed.
They shall thereby deserve great thank of god / and give also a good and a
blessed example to al ye people toward a good universal reformacion Amen.
