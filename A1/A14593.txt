A Brief Treatise of the Plague Wherein is showed, The Natural cause of the
Plague. Preseruations from the infection. Way to cure the infected.


Newly corrected with new additions, and many approved Remedies.

To the Reader.
GOD most merci^^^ly chastineth his Children for their sins when they forget
him: sometime with war, sometime with famine, and sometime with the
pestilence and other diseases, that they might forsake their sins, and flee
unto him for help: but the wicked, to their utter destruction.

Yet he never sends a plague or punishment but he continually preserves
some. Yea, and those al^o he preserves by means. Therefore they worthily are
consumed which neglect that lawful means God has appointed, even as they
were justly drowned that would not enter Noah's ark. And Lots sons worthily
consumed, because they would not forsake Sodom, and they justly partakers of
the plagues of Egypt which forsook the land of Goshen, and their first borne
deservedly slain, which marked not the posts of their doors with the blood of
the Lamb. And were they not justly scourged to death, which would not behold
the Brazen Serpent Moses set up?

Does not the whole History of the Bible, both the old and new Testament
comm^nd unto us the law^ull means whereby we are to be preserved from dangers.

Therefore they are greatly too blame that contemn the good means which God
has appointed for their safety, and do wilfully, rashly, and foolishly run
themselves into all kind of dangers, saying, GOD is able to preserve them if
it please him, themselves neither using the lawful means God has appointed,
not yet eschewing the danger: which means according to the judgment of the
best Writers upon this matter, thou shall here find briefly, which I pray
God may be profitable unto thee, and that he will keep us from all plagues and
dangers which we have justly deserved. Val^.

Of the natural causes of the infection of the air, and of the plague.
OF all the diseases whereunto the body of man is subject, the Plague or
Pestilence is the most terrible and fearful, and most contagious, therefore
we must seek all means, both natural and artificial, to preserve our selves
and families from it: therefore first we will speak of the natural causes of
this infection.

There be two especial causes of the Pestilence.

The first is, an infected, corrupted and putrified Air.

The second is, evil and corrupt hu^^^^ engendered in the ^^^y.

The air is corrupted and infected diverse ways as Astronomers say, by the
influences, aspects, conjunctions, and opposition of ill planets, the Eclipse
of the Sun and Moon, through the i^^oderate heat of the air, where the
temperature of the air is turned from his natural state to excessive heat
and moisture, which is the worst temperament of the air, (...) being drawn up
by the heat of the Sun, remaining unconsumed, do rot, putrify, and
corrupt, and so with the veneme ^he air beco^^eth corrupted and infected.

Also the air is often corrupted by the euaporation of dea^ c^rcasses ly^^g
^^^^ried, as it (...) in the ^^rres, (...) also by the euaporation of p^^les,
(...) marshes, stinking and noisome sinkes and kennells.

A man falls into the Pestilence by disordering of himself, (...) in diet,
or wi^h other exercises.

Therefore, during the time of (...) sickness (...) must have a special
regard, to keep^ himself from all (...), and (...) (to wit) from all excess
of meat, drink, sweating, bathes, lechery, and all other things that open the
pores of the body, and causes the bad airs to enter, which entering, inuenome
the lively spirits of man, and infect, and endanger the whole body.

And seeing it is evident, that the plague as pestilence is not caused, but
through the breathing in of pestilent and corrupt air, there cannot be a more
^a^e and present remedy to preserve one, then by ^ying from that corrupt air,
there is no other means to (...) pestilent air, because, whether (...) we
must draw in such air, unless we get us away into some other place where the
air is not corrupted nor infected, but pure and good, neither must you return
(...) from that place (...).

Observations to be used, preserving from the Plague.
But if upon ^rgent occasion of bu^^ne^^e you may not (...) then have a
special care that the hou^e in which you must tarry, be kept clea^^ and (...),
without (...) or ^^u^^ishnesse, let the windows be kept close, and (...)
especially in clowdy and rainie wether, that the pestilent air enter not in,
but if you will open them, do it obout midday.

You must come abroad as seldom as you can, and not (if you may) except the
element be clear and bright, but before you come abroad, you must take (...)
^e^icine, which is able to preserve you from infections, as the root of
Ang^^ca, Pimper^ell, etc. chewes in the mouth. chewed in the mouth.

Also you must make ^ires daily in your house^, (...) the corrupt air that is
in the house, may be the better purged and (...) of the air.

Also if you Juniper, Ta^^^^is^^^, Bay lea^^^s, Rosemary, and such like are
very good to purge the house of ^ll aires, and to (...) and from upon it the
p^^^er of Rosemary, Sage, Rue, Be^on^e, wormwood, Mai^ram, Orig^n, Juniper
berries, M^^h, Frankensence and Ma^^^ke, Cipres^e barks, Angeli^^ the r^^ts or
^ea^^s, Lau^nder, (...) of Aloes, Gall^^ Mus^h^^a, C^oues, any one of all these
are very good to air your house withal.

It is best in hot weather to corr^^^ and puri^^^ the air with co^^ (...), as
with ^word: (...) leaves, and branches of Willowes, etc. and to sprinckle the
^l^^re with coldwater mixed with Viniger, Roses, or (...), etc.

It is very good when out goes abroad to have something in their hands to
(...) to, the better to avoid those noisome (...) and filthy (...) which are
in every corner, therefore it is very good to carry in the hand a branch of
Rue, Rosemary, Roses, or Camphir^ and the smell of Viniger is very (...)
something like this. Take of, Lapdanum, three drachmes. Storax calamintae, two
drachmes. of each a drachme. Cinomon, Cloves, Nutmegs,
Wood of Aloes, a scruple. Spiknard, half a scruple. of each half a drachme.
Mirh, Mastik, Frankencense,
of each three grains. Musk, Amber.



Make them to powder and ^earce them, and take (...) water, and Rose viniger,
wherein (...) is dissolved, and so make it up in a Pomander.

Seeing also, that gluttony, excess, and drunkenness, is at al times to be
shunned, so at this time of infection is most dangerous, breeding the humors,
and corrupting the body: Therefore they yt love their health, let them use
temperance in their diet, and choose such meats as engender good blood, and be
not ready to putrify and rot, but be of easy digestion, and eat with them
sharp sauces, as vinigere, or the iuyces of sharp things, as veri^yce, juice
of Citrons, Lemonds, Oringes, etc.

Also use for pot herbs, sage, or otherwise, Parcely, Maioram, Balm, Hysops,
B^glose, Endine, Succorie, and Lettice.

Also he must refrain from eating of much fruit, for it does breed corrupt
blood, and if he eat any it must be (...).

Also he must eat little garlik, onions, or (...), for these cause unkind
heat.

Also suffer not thirst greatly, and when thou do thirst, drink but
measurably, and that but small and thin drink, or barley water, (...) with
(...).

Ano^^er special regard must be had in exercises, vbi, qu^^od^, and (...). The
place where, must be in a (...) and pure air, and (...) must ^se them
temperately and moderately, and (...) of violent exercises, as dancing,
running, leaping: and wh^^soeuer such like kind of exercise that causes after
breathing in of Air, ^e must refrain in the extreme heat of the day, and in
places where is much con^^urse of people.

As for his sleep and (...), let them be mean and moderate, only his sleep
must be sufficient to suffice Nature, and in a close Chamber, (...), and the
windows and doors, close shut, lest the ill air enter into it, and he must
have regard that his sheets be clean and sweet ^agges in chests where they
keep linen.

It is good also at night before you go in bed to air the chamber with a good
fire, or with a cha^^ng dish of coals, wherein it were good to ^^ro some powder
of Rue, Sage, Be^onie, or of Juniper and such like.

When you walk in the morning, first empty the body of all super^^uities and
excremen^s, and take heed: and beware the body, be not too (...) at any time.
Therefore, if of thy self n^^^rally at any time thou can not void out
excrements, thou shall take ^yther a potion of pills, or else a glister o^
suppos^^^ry o^ (...): or el^e take of Aloes epatick, two parts, of each one
part. Amon^ia^^m, Mirrh.



With white wine or with the Water of scabious make pills of them, which
minister daily, if you will one scruple at a time.

These pills (...) most resist putrefaction, and have a very great virtue
against the infecting of the pestilent air.

Blood-letting also is very wholesome for young folk, and such as (...) great
store o^ blood, for it does much cool the state of the body, and brings it
to a moderate hear, and lets out the corrupt humors, which do make the
body more subi^ct to infection: bloodletting is very necessary in the time of
infection, and does much profit, and preserve health.

Also it is very (...) to be too passionate or melancholy: for the passions of
sadness, Anger, hatred, fear, great cares, and heavy thoughts and sighing,
do much distemper the body and make it (...) to withstand the infection: but on
the contrary it is very good to use joy and mirth with temperance.

Signs to know the infected.
Having before showed the natural and original causes of the plague and
pestilence, with the best means for the preservation of a man's self from it,
we will proceed and show, first the ^^gnes whereby a man may best judge of
himself, whether he be already infected, or not, and the means to cure the
^^ck.

As concerning the signs that declare one to be already infe^^^^, they are
many.

First when the outward members are cold, and the inward parts burning hot,
when there is a pain and heaviness of the head, and a great inclination to
^eepe. A wearines, heaviness, and difficulty in breathing. A sadness and
carfulness of the mind: a change of countenance, with a frowning look of
the eyes: loss of stomach and appetit^: immoderate thirst and often vomiting:
a bitterness and drienesse of the mouth: The Pulse frequent, small and deep,
the urine troublous, thick, and stinking like beasts urine.

The surest token of al to know the infected of the plague, is* if there do
arise and engender botches behind the ears, or under the armeholes, or about
the share: or also if Carbuncles do arise in any member suddenly, for when
they do appear they betoken strength of Nature: Which being strong and
mighty, does labor to drive the poison out of the body, but if botches do not
appear, it is more perilous and dangerous: for it betokens that nature is
weak and feeble, and not able to expel and drive out the venomous humors, and
then you must have respect to the signs before rehearsed.

Also (...) botches which do appear, they do declare which members of the body
be infected above any other, and do ^^rust out veni^ous humors from them.

The infection of the plague enters into a man in this (...).

In a (...) are three principal parts (that i^) the heart, liver, and arms,
and each of the^^ has his cleansing place: Therefore if they do appear in the
neck, they do show the brains to be chiefly vexed: if under the arme-holes,
the heart, but if they appear in the share, the liver is most infected.

For a man having taken same venom, it is mingled with the blood, and runs
to the heart, which is the chief part of man: and the heart by kind puts
the venom to his clensing place which is the arme-holes* and it being stopped,
puts to the next princip^ll part, that is the Liver, and it passes it to
his cleansing place which is the Ihigh-holes or share: Likewise they b^ing
stopped, pass it to the next principal place (that is) the arms, and to their
clensing places which are under the ears, or under the throat, and they being
stopped, suffer it not to pass out, th^^ it is (...) xii. hours before it
rest in any place, and if it be (...) let out within the space of xxiiii.
hours by bleeding, it castes a man into an ague, and makes a bot^^ in one of
the three places, or near them.

The cure of the infected of the plague.
The best way to cure the plague is in this, when thou find thy self to be
infected, and feel the blood flickering, bleed in the first hour, or within
six hours after drinck not, (...) tarry not above twelve hours from
bleeding, for when thy blood is so flickering, the venom is then moving and
not yet settled, and after it is to late: those that are fat may be let
bl^^d, or else not.

If the matter be gathered under the armeholes, it comes from the heart by the
vein cardiall, then bleed on the same side: on the innermost vein of the arm
commonly called B^sollica: but bleed not on both sides, except it be in both
armeholes, for that is dangerous, and loss of good blood.

And if the boch does appear behind the ears, or above the (...), or in any
other parts of the face, or neck, you must let blo^d out of vein Cephali^a, on
the same side let blood with c^pping glasse^ for that is the best, or a horse
^each, or horse (...).

But if the botch appear in the share, you must then bleed in the ^^uckle of
the same (...), and then in any case bleed not in the Arm, for it will draw up
the matter again.

But if there app^^re no botch outwardly, you must then draw blood out of the
same side where is felt the greatest pain and heaviness, and out of which vein
the pain and grief of the members aflicted will declare.

For if the members above the breast be most grieved and afflicted, cut the
Cephalica vein. But if the parts about the neck be most grieved, bleed in the
Basillica, or middle vein.

And if the nether parts be most grieved and vexed bl^^d in the hamme or
ankles. And if nature be strong, and other things not letting draw out blood
abundantly.

But if through age or for other causes you may not use bl^^d letting, then you
must fasten cupping glasses and (...) them.

And if you perceive the pestilence to infect or invade you at meat, or upon a
full stomach, then vomitt straiteway, and when the body and stomach is empty,
then take some medicine that can resist poison as methrydate or Triacle.

When the patient has taken some medcines that will expel the venom, lay him in
a warmed bed, being made with soft she^^s, and well covered with clothes, that
there he may sweat well, for the space of four or five hours, or more,
according to his strength. But if by this means you can scarsly provoke him to
sweat, you may use some other means, as by the heating of tiles, and laying
them hot to the feet of the patient, or with stone bottles filled with hot
water, and being close stopped with cork, that the water spil not, and so put
into the bed to the sick, they will by their beat provoke him readily to sweat.
And all the time the sick does sweat, you must take heed that he neither
sleep, eat, nor drink.

And after he has sweat, you must wipe diligently off the sweat, with very
clean and fine linen clothes. Then afterward let the sick rise from his bed,
if he either will or can: But let him not come into the open air, but eschew
it as much as (...). Also let the air of the chamber in the which the sick
does ^ie, be (...) and amended and purified with odo^^^ro^^ things and wi^h
sweet smelling perfumes, such as are before declared.

Lastly, the principal (...) whole body bring cleansed by bleeding, or cupping
and sweating, the patient must be very ^ary, and measurable in his diet, for in
the (...) which is accidental to this sickness: it is good to eat (...) flesh
but little chickens (...) with fresh water, but it is best to give (...) him the
breath of a chicken two or three hours after he ha^^ (...), and often,
according to his strength, for the sick and weak must be norished and
refreshed by little and little: If the breath have in it the juice of lemons,
orenges, ^eriuice, or vinegar, it is the better.

Preservatives against the Plague or Pestilence.
TAke (...) and (...), of each a little, and lay them in a little Vinegar, then
take a sponge and wett it therein, and this you (...) carry about you in a
(...) or any thing else, to smell thereon, and this will preserve you from the
infected.

Another.
ALso take Angelli^s root, and hold in your mouth, for it is excellent (...)
keep your body that no corrupted air came therein: likewise (...) pills is
very good to hold in your mouth, or Cloves.

Another.
IT is good to keep the head and stomach clean p^^ged, and not to ouerlay it
with eating and drinking, nor to eat gross meats, but to abstain from all
manner of (...) and gross meats, and to purge your self as often as you can with
some gentle purge, as (...) pills, or such like.

Another excellent preservative.
TAke a Fig or a Walnut, and in a morning fasting, take a little Rue and a
corn of bay salt, and eat them together, (...) this will preserve you, that
you need not fear the infection.

Another preservative by purging the blood.
TAke in your pottage, Buglase, B^rr^ge, Suckory, ^ettyse, and such like
herbs: It shall be also very good at your meat to eat the inside of a
^ytteron, with a little ^nger, at morning, at noone, and at night when you got
to bed: and it would be very good to wash your hands, and to bathe your temples
and your pulses with Vinegar Rosset, and it would be good to perfume your
houses with Vinegar and Rue upon a tyle stone being heated in the fire: it is
very good to hold your head over it: it is excellent good to keep your body
that no infected air enter therein.

A proved Remedy for the plague.
TAKE an Oinion, and cut him overthwart, or a sunder, then make a little hole
in each piece, the which ye shall fill with fine treakle and set the pieces
together again, then wrap them in a wet lynnen cloth, cutting it as you would
a warden and so roste him in the embers, seeing it be covered with embers, and
when it is roasted enough, stra^^e out all the Juice thereof, and give the
patient a spoonefull thereof to drink, and it will heal him by the grace of
God.

Take sorrel and lay it in steep in vinegar a day, and then (...), and when
the patient feels himself (...), give him a draught thereof, and (...) he
brook it, two or three hours after give him more thereof to drink, and by
the grace of God he shall be healed.

Another for these that feel themselves infected.
TAKE Card^^s Benedictus, the leaf, and dry it, then beat it to powder, and
give the patient to drink of it, and then let him sweat, and it will heal
him by the grace of God.

A preservative.
TAKE London Treakel, which you shall have* at diverse Apoticaries shops, in
London, which do make it themselves*
