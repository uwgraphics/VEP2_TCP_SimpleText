TO THE HIGH and MIGHTY and magnificent Princes Frederick Electo Palatine of
the Reine: and his betrothed Lady, Elizabeth the only daughter of my Lord the
king.
The virgin PARTHENIA (whilst yet I may I offer up to your virgin Highnesses.
To you (Gracious Lady even from the birth she was intended: and now I trust
shall be more welcome having learnd to tune and twine togeith these next
neighbor letters E and F. the vowell that makes so sweet a Consona^t. Her
notes so linkt and wedded togeither seem lively Hierogliphicks of the harmony
of marriage. the high and holy State wherinto you shortly must be incorporat.
This small work (yet first in this kind) was only meant for this lesser world:
howbeit under your shadows (in yor sunneshine I should say rather; yt is, yor
sweet and glorious Consorte it may sound and relish in the ears of the
greater. For Music like that miraculous tongue of the Apostles having but one
and ye same Caracter is alike known to all the sundry nations of ye world. And
what wonder sine Harmony is the Soul thereof multipliciously varied of four
bare notes as ye Body is of the four Elements. These lessons were composed by
three famous Masters in the faculties. whereof one had ye honor to be yor
teacher most Illustrious lady; and had he not had it before thereby deserved
the style of a Doctor. If to their greatr grace, yor Grace will vouchsafe to
lend yor white hands they will arrive with more pleasure at ye princely ears of
yor GREAT FREDERIKE. Our lord Jesus who has honored marriage with his dear
praesence and first miracle, extraordinarily do^ne at ye instance of his maiden
mother, aeternally bless you maids and married.

Yor Highnesses most humbly William Hole

Mr. HVGH HOLLAND On his worthy friend W: H: and his Triumuiri of Music.
List to that sweet Recorder;
How daintily this BYRD his notes does vary,
As if he were the Nightingalls own brother!
Lo where does pace in order
A brauer BULL then did Europacary:
Nay set all Europe show me such an other.
Orlando though was counted Musicks fathr;
Yet this ORLANDO parallels di Lasso:
Whose triple praise would tire a very Iasso;
The^ hecre in one these three men rather hear you
And praise thaire songs: and sing his praise who, married
Those notes so well which they so sweetly varied.
Mr: GEO: CHAPMAN In worthy love of this new worck, and the most Autenticall
Aucthors.
By these choice lessons of these Music Mastrs;
Ancient, and heightn'd with ye Arts full Bowls
Let all our modern, mere Phantastique Tasters,
(Whose Art but foreign Novelty extolls)
Rule and confine their fancies; and prefer
The constant right. and depthe Art should Induce;
To all lite flashes, by whose light they err;
This witty Age, has wisdom least in use;
The World, old growing, Old, with it, grow Men;
Their skylls decaying, like their bodies strength;
Young Men, to oulde are now out Childeren:
First Rules of Art, increase still with their length.
Which see in this new worck, yet never seen:
Art, ye more oulde, grows eur ye more green.
Preludium.
