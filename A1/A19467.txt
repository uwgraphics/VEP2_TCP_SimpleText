But he himself which did it make,
Except it be his special friend,
Which may it sell, and give, and lend.

MOst singular, most excellent, most beautiful, most glorious, and most worthy
Savior, most entirely beloved, and most sweet Jesus; in token of my humblest
devotion I owe unto thy most sacred self, I here dedicate this Mite (entitled
Andrews Petition) which is the true Copy of my loyallest affection unto thee.
And so often from the bottom of my heart I do salute thee, as there be Angels
in heaven, drops of water in the sea, Stars in the Firmament, leaves on the
trees, and grass on the ground: yea incessantly with all humility, I salute
thee in the union of love; and unto the most blessed and sweet heart of thy own
sweet self, I do in all dutiful affection assign my self and my dearest
love unto thee, my sweet and loving Savior; (although unworthy) to be thy
servant; and I most humbly beseech thee, that thou will vouchsafe to entertain
and receive me, that I may be wholly thine; and thou Co-equall with God thy
Father, may be wholly mine: that after my ended miseries thou will crown me
with thy endless mercies: unto this sweet Jesus my Savior, say Amen.

And so Amen.
To all Christian sinners, that desire repentance, health in the LORD.
Read attentively, and judge indifferently, but pray continually: receive
instructions willingly, and watch in the same seriously with all sedulity.

Treasure them in your hearts carefully, and daily meditate thereon zealously,
that ye enter not into temptation carelessly.

The Author to the Reader.
IT is well known (gentle Reader) unto many, besides my license of absence,
which I John Andrews the Author of this work have to show, that by the
handiwork of God, in sending contrary winds, I have lost to the value of
threescore pounds by the year in spiritual livings within the Realm of
Ireland, to the utter impouerishing of me, my wife and children for ever,
except God in his mercy open the hearts of well disposed Gentlemen, and others,
by their good liking of these my labors to relieve me in these my present
wants, that thereby I may attain unto some better estate again. Wherefore I
bestow this mite of my poor labors, called Andrews Petition, upon you, in
all dutiful manner, and with as tender affection as ever Nurse or Mother gave
their breasts to their children, or the Pelican sucked the blood from her breast
to feed and cherish her young, I do hereby kindly present the same, desiring
almighty God that it may breathe out such sound and godly doctrine to your good
liking in your heart, that it may become a special salve to cure and preserve
your soul.

Yours in all Christian duties to be commanded, John Andrews.

sake, to prepare my mind to prayer psalm. 119, 26, 27, 33, 34, 124 psalm. 143, 10
, for I know not how to pray as I should Romans 8, 16
, but thou (O Lord) art ready to answer before I call: And while I pray thou will hear Esaias 65, 24 Mat. 6, 8 Psalm. 145.19 1 pet. 3, 12

, on the poor Publican Lu. 18:13, 14.
, on Mary Magdalen Luk: 7.44.
, or on the penitent These, which came unto thee in his last hour Luk, 13:43.
.

For thou O Lord have brought me home from Banishment Heb. 11.13.16
, redeemed me from Bondage Gal. 2:4: Gal 5.1.13.
, withdrawn me from punishment Esa. 53.3.4.
, written me upon thy hands Esa: 49.16.

Although the mother forget her child, or the child his mother that bare him,
yet thou (O Lord) have promised never to forget those that forsake their
sins, and come unto thee for mercy Esaias 49.15.
. O therefore, sweet Jesus Wisd. 16.21.
, I entirely beseech thee, that according unto thy freee promises Eze. 18.21,
22 Ier. 4.7. Eccl. 27, 22.
, and according to thy most gracious Covenant Ier. 31.33.
, thou will have mercy upon me, and cast me not away from thy presence Psalm.

, neither let my long continued sins (O Lord) cause thee to hide thy face
from me John 13.26. Psalm. 13.1

For here I bow the very knees of my heart unto thee O God, and kneel Acts

The Praise of WISDOM. Proverbs Chap. 3.
Blessed is the man that Wisdom finds,
And he that does obtain
True Understanding, and thereof
Does know the precious gain:
For better it is to get the same,
Then silver ready told,
And better profit it does bring
Then merchandise of gold.
Wisdom does precious stones exceed
And all things else that are,
There is nothing thou can desire,
To be compared to her.
Upon her right hand is long life,
Which never is bereft,
Riches and honor do attend
And wait upon the left.
Her ways are passing pleasant ways,
Her paths are full of rest,
She is a tree of life to those
Which her to seek are pressed.
She is I say a tree of Life
To such as on her hold,
And such as always keep her fast,
Are blessed manifold.
My son let not these things depart,
Nor from thine eye to pass:
But keep my laws and counsels eke,
And thou shall find them grace
Unto thy mouth, and to thy soul
They shall be perfect life.
So shall thou safely walk the way
Whereas there is no strife:
Thy foot from stumbling so thou may
At all times surely keep.
When thou lie down thou needst not care,
But rest and sweetly sleep:
Thou shall not need to be afraid
Of any sudden fear,
For violent force of wicked men
Which chance, take thou no care.
For violent rushing in of such
As the ungodly are,
Of them thou needst not to account,
Nor let them not thee scare.
For why, the Lord with thee shall be
At hand, and keep thy foot,
That by deceiving sleights of foes
Thou never shall be took.
THE AVTHOR to his Book.
GO thou my Book with the zeal of my heart
To all that shall come view thee:
When thou have past from the Press, and art print
Cry daily, Come peruse me:
If that thou can give to them all content,
Then is my labor ended,
Which is the thing that I have desired
For my pains on thee spended.
FINIS.
