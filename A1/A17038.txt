The Sum of Christian RELIGION.
Question. WHerein stands a man's true happiness?
Answer. In the recovery of Gods favor by Christ, which we lost by the fall
of Adam and Eve, our first parents.

Q. What was their estate by creation?
A. They were created after the image of God, in wisdom, holiness, and
righteousness, Genesis 1. 26. Col. 3. 10. Ephesians. 4. 24. They enjoyed the
pleasures of Paradise, and the plenty of the world, without any grief of
mind, or pain of body: They were free from death, so long as they were free
from sin.

Q. How sinned they?
A. The devil in the serpent entised the woman, and she the man, to eat of the
fruit forbidden upon pain of death, Ioh. 8. 44. Genes. 3. 1.

Q. Was the eating of that fruit a great and heinous sin?
A. Yea, in many respects; for our parents believed not Gods threatening, and so
made him a liar, 1. Ioh. 5. 10. They trusted not in his goodness, but esteemed
him envious, as one that withheld good things from them; but the devil was
believed, and esteemed a kind friend. They showed deuillish pride, and vile
ingratitude. They became rebels against their gracious God.

Q. What hurt receive we by this their fall?
A. Hereby all mankind is defiled with sin, original and actual, and
therefore is under the wrath and curse of God, To. 5. 12.

Q. What is original sin?
A. The sin of Adam justly imputed to us all, Romans 5. 19. Heb. 7. 10.
together with the corruption of our nature thence ensuing. For by Adams fall,
man's mind is darkened, his will is become rebellious, his affections worldly,
or brutish or deuillish, his conscience hard or erroneous, and his whole nature
infected, as it were with poison, Genes. 5. 3. and 6. 5. Ephesians. 4. 17, 18.

Q. How does this appear?
A. Because every natural man is void of the true knowledge of God, and of
himself, and of the way of true happiness. He is full of error, Ierem. 10.
14. 1. Corinthians. 2. 14. He has no power, nor true desire to repent, to believe,
or to obey, 2. Corinthians. 3. 5. He is prone to al evil, unapt to any good,
under the power and strong chains of sin, and the bondage of the devil,
Ephesians. 2. 1, 2. Tit. 3. 3.

Q. What is actual sin?
A. The actual transgression of any of Gods Commandments, 1. Ioh. 3. 4.

Q. What punishments are due to man for sin, original and actual?
A. 1. All corporal punishments, as war, famine, pestilence, and other
diseases, and all bodily torments, inflicted by God or man, Deuteronomy. 28.

2. All spiritual punishments, as to be given over of God, to our own
blindness and hardness of heart, and to the seducement of the devil and his
instruments, Exodus 7. 3. Romans 1. 24, 26. 2 Thessalon. 2. 9, 10, 11.

3. Besides these temporal punishments, the endless and intolerable torments
of hell, are the due desert of our sins, Genes. 2. 17. Romans 6. 23. Ephesians. 5.
6.

Q. How may we be delivered from this horrible estate into which we are fallen,
and recover Gods favor, and that blessed estate from whence we are fallen?
A. Gods love and favor may be recovered by his Son Jesus Christ, if being
rightly prepared we come unto him, Matthew. 11. 28.

Q. How may we be rightly prepared to come unto Christ?
A. Gods Law contained in the Ten Commandments, must be our Schoolmaster; it
will bring us unto Christ, if we rightly vn-tderstand it, and make use of it,
Romans 3. 20. Gal. 2. 19. Gal. 3. 24.

Q. How may we rightly understand these Commandments?
A. By observing two things: Frst, that every Commandment does command things
good, and forbid things evil, Psalm. 34. 14. Secondly, that every commandment
does forbid not only gross sins, but also those which the world accounts
small sins, or no sins at all, Math. 5. 19. Ephesians. 5. 4. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 22.
Jude v. 23.

Q. How are the Commandments to be divided?
A. Into two Tables: The first containing man's duty toward God; the second his
duty toward his neighbor.

Q. Which is the first Commandment?
A. Thou shall have none other Gods but me.

Q. What is here commanded, and what forbidden?
A. This first Commandment contains all inward duties of the heart toward
God: As to know him, and choose him, to love and to fear him above all, to
trust in him, to pray to him faithfully, to give him thanks sincerely Mark 12.
30. 1 Samuel 12. 24. Psalm. 50. 14, 15.

Here we are not only forbidden to be atheists. Psalm. 14. 1. Tit. 1. 16. to
have the gods of the Heathen for our God, Ier. 2. 11, 12. or to seek help and
comfort from the devil, by witchcraft ahd sorcery, Leuit. 19. 31. but the
least withdrawing of our hearts from God is here forbid, 1 Chr. 22. 5. 2 King.
20. 13. Ier. 17. 5. and the setting of our hearts on riches, pleasures, and
vainglory, 1 Ioh. 2. 15, 16. Ephesians. 5. 5. 2 Timothy 3. 4. all wandering thoughts
at the time of prayer, preaching, and other holy exercises, Eccles. 4. 17. Esaias
29. 13. Iam. 5. 16.

Also to fear man more than God; as al they do that commit those sins
secretly, which they will not commit openly, Job 24. 15. So every passion of
wicked grief, or desire, or joy being against the love of God, is against this
Commandment, Matt. 2. 3. Nehem. 2. 10. Genes. 27. 41. Iud. 18. 20. Luke. 22. 5.

Q. Then belike they deceive themselves, that think this Commandment easy to
be kept, and that they can and do keep it.
A. Doubtless they are greatly deceived, for this Commandment is ofter broken
than any other, and whichsoeuer Commandment a man breaks, he breaks this
withal: for in every sin a man erreth from that love and fear which he
owes to God, Leuit. 19. 3, 4, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 28, 30, 31, 32, 34, 36,
37.

Q. Which is the second Commandment?
A. Thou shall not make to thy self, etc.

Here we are taught, how to worship God outwardly; that we do it truly
according to his word, and also diligently, and reverently, Deu. 12. 32. Ioh.
4. 24. Genesis 18. 16, 17. Eccles: 4. 17.

God here forbids not only images, but all other false and superstitious
worship, with all drowsinesse, negligence, and all vnreuerent behavior in his
service, Math. 15. 9. Ierem. 48. 10.

Q. Which is the third Commandment?
A. Thou shall not take the Name, etc.

Here we are commanded to talk often of Gods Majesty, of his Word, and of his
works, and that with all reverence, and in our talk to defend truth and
virtue, Deutero. 6. 6. Ezra. 8. 22.

God here forbids, not only blasphemy, profane swearing, and cursing, but
also all foolish and idle talking of his Majesty, and all profane maintayning
of sin and error of his word, or of his works, Matthew. 5. 34. Job 33. 8, 9,
10, 11. Job 38. 2. and 39. 37, 38. Job 42. 3. Ephesians. 4. 29. Col. 4. 6.

Q. Which is the fourth Commandment?
A. Remember that thou keep holy, etc.

We are here commanded to bestow Gods Sabbath in holy exercises, both public
and private; as in hearing, reading, praying, singing, meditating.

God here forbids, not only the labors of husbandry, handicrafts, and such
like, but also iournies on the Lords day, paying and also receiving sums of
money, following of Law business, making of bargains, idleness, and the
choking of heavenly and spiritual delights, by those that on this day
specially, give themselves over to carnal pleasures and pastimes, Esaias 58. 13.
Act. 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 2. Reu. 1. 8. Neh. 13. 15.

Q. What is the fruit of such profaning of the Sabbath?
A. Barbarous and heathenish ignorance, and all manner of wickedness.

Q. Which is the fifth Commandment?
A. Honor thy father and thy mother, etc.

By this Commandment, children, servants, and all inferiors, must honor,
that is, love, reverence, and obey, their parents, masters and other
superiors: And parents, and masters, are commanded to train up their
children, and servants, in godliness; and Magistrates to govern, Ministers to
instruct the people, as careful and tender fathers. The contrary sins, greater
or less, are here forbidden, Ephesians. 5. 22, etc. Col. 3. 18, 19, 20. 21, 22. and
4. 1. Romans 13. 1. 1. Pet 2. 13, 14. Psalm. 78. 71, 72. Hebr. 13. 17. 1 Pet. 5.
1, 2, 3.

Q. Which is the sixth Commandment?
A. Thou shall do no murder.

We are here commanded, to perform all works of mercy toward our neighbor,
both for body and soul, Esaias 58. 7. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 14. Matthew. 25. 35.

Q. Which is the seventh Commandment?
A. Thou shall not commit adultery.

Here all chastity of body and mind is commanded, with a settled and constant
resolution, never to defile our selves, Job 31. 1. 1. Cor. 7. 34. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 4.

Not only fornication and adultery are here forbidden, but also all wanton
desires and purposes, all unchaste speeches, songs, gestures, sporting, and
dalliance, with all degrees, allurements, and occasions of wantonness, to the
corrupting of our selves and others, Genesis 38. 14. Genesis 39. 7. 2 King. 9. 30.
Prou. 7. 10, 11, 12. 13. Matt. 5. 28. Mar. 6. 22. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 22. Ephesians. 5. 4.

Q. Which is the eighth Commandment?
A. Thou shall not steal.

We are here commanded to labor with body or mind, for our own maintenance,
and the relief of others, Ephesians 4. 28. 2 The. 3. 10.

Not only robbing or stealing things of value, but also the fraudulent taking
of any, the least thing that is not ours; all false weights and measures,
bribery, all deceit in bargaining, all gain with the injury and hurt of our
neighbor, and all desires and purposes tending thereto, are here forbidden,

All purity of the heart toward our neighbor is here commanded.

The first motions of sin against our neighbor, even without the consent of
the will are here forbidden, Romans 7. 7.

Q. I hear no mention of the sin of drunkenness, does no commandment forbid
this sin?
A. Yes, for drunkenness is a cause of many sins, and drunkards sin either
directly or by consequence against every Commandment.

Q. How sin they against the first, second, third, and fourth Commandments?
A. They love pleasures more then God, they neglect the outward service of God,
they are commonly great swearers, and Sabbath breakers.

Q. How sin they against the Commandments of the second table?
A. They disobey parents, masters, Magistrates and Ministers, they often brawle
and fight, and sometimes kill or wound; many of them resort to wicked houses,
not only for drink, but for whoredom also. They deceive their Creditors, and
beggar their own wives and Children. They are railers and slanderers, all
concupiscence reigns in them, and they omit all manner of duties to God and
their neighbor.

Q. But who are drunkards?
A. Not only they that reele, or are void of reason, but all riotous and idle
tippling Companions, that for love of drink do live in the forenamed sins, or
in any of them.

Q. Thou said, that the Law is a schoolmasters to bring us unto Christ, if
we can make right use of it. Show me then what use is to be made of these
Commandments?
A. By these, the wicked are taught to see and discern their own wickedness,
in that they do not keep any of Gods Laws, nor truly endeavor to keep them,
but that they daily and hourly rebel against God, and so are under the power
of sin and Satan their master, and in the ready way to be damned for ever
with him, Romans 3. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2. 2.
Cor. 4. 4. 2. Tim. 2. 26. Deuteronomy. 27. 26.

Q. Yea, but this Doctrine is grievous and uncomfortable.
A. So it is to the wicked, but it is wholesome for them if they will receive
it; for unfeigned sorrow is the only way to true comfort: If we labor and be
heavy laden with our sins, Christ inuiteth us to come unto him, wlth promise
to ease us, Matthew 11. 28. John 3. 16. 1 Timothy 1. 15.

Q. After that we are come unto Christ, is there no more use to be made of
these Commandments?
A. Yes, for they serve as a rule to the godly, whereby they measure all their
actions, yea, their words, and al their inward thoughts and affections, Psalm.
18. 21, 22, 23. Psalm. 19. 11. and 119. 1, 9. and where they find themselves to
swerve and decline, though never so little, from this rule, they bewail their
infirmity, and stir up their repentance, 2 Sa. 24. 10. Mat. 26. 75. Romans 7. 22,
23.

Q. How does the Law of God bring a man unto Christ?
A. By showing him his misery, that he may sue to Christ for mercy, Matt. 9.
12.

Q. And what then does Christ for him?
A. He works in him true repentance and a lively faith,

Q. What is true repentance?
A. It is a supernatural change of the heart, and of the thoughts, words and
deeds, from infidelity to faith, from disobedience to obedience and from all
sins to the contrary virtues, Math. 3. 2. and 4. 17. Romans 12. 2 Ephesians. 4. 22. etc
Math. 3. 8. Acts 26. 18.

A. What is a lively faith?

A. A supernatural gift of God, Ephesians. 1. 19. 20. and 2. 8. Math. 16. 17.
whereby a sinner believing Gods promises in Christ, is united with him, Ioh. 6.
33, 56. Ioh. 15. 5. Romans 6. 3, etc. Gal. 2. 20. Ephesians. 1. 22. 23 Hos. 2. 19. Ephesians.
5. 30. is justified and sanctfied Genesis 15. 6. Act. 15. 9 and draws near to
God for deliverance from all evil, and the obtaining of all good. Romans 5. 1. 2
Ephesians. 3. 12 Heb. 4. 16 and 10. 22. Genesis 15. 1.

Q. On whom is this gift bestowed?
A. Only upon the elect, Act. 13. 48. Tit. 1. 1. Ioh. 12. 39, 40.

Q. How is faith wrought?
A. By Gods Word and Spirit.

Q. How by the Word?
A. Gods Word shows us, whence and how grievously we have fallen, and what
means God has ordained to restore us, Romans 1. 16. and 10. 17.

Q. How by the Spirit?
A. The Holy Ghost works effectually on them that are to be saved,
inlightning their dark minds, softning their hard hearts, causing them
clearly to discern, and carefully to regard the things which the word
teaches; to tremble at Gods justice, and their own heinous deserts; highly to
prize Christ the Redeemer, to esteem all things dross and dung in comparison
of him, and never to rest till God by Christ has received them into favor,
Act. 16. 14. Ier. 31. 33. Eze. 11. 19. Ephesians. 2. 1. Ioh. 6. 44, 45. Deuteronomy. 30. 6.

Q. In what case are they that hear the Word without this working of the
Spirit?
A. Seeing they see not, hearing they hear not, they discern not their own
filthiness, nor the wrath of God abiding on them; they value Christ beneath
their earthly riches and pleasures, Deuteronomy. 29. 3, 4. Es. 6. 9. Matt. 13. 13.
Matthew. 19. 22. Mark. 5. 17. Matthew. 22. 2.

Q. What is their estate in whom God by his Word and Spirit works this faith?
A. By this faith they receive Christ, they live the life of grace, they are
justified, and sanctified, they please God, they are made the children of God,
they ouercom the world and the devil, and obtain eternal salvation, Ioh. 1.
12. Hab. 2. 4. Genesis 15. 6. Act. 15. 9. Heb. 11. 5, 6. 1 Ioh. 5. 4. Ephesians. 6.
16. 1 Pet. 1. 9.

Q. But many that believe, live wickedly, and are overcome of the world and the
devil.
A. They have but an historical faith, a dead faith, a faith of devils, which
cannot profit them, I am. 2. 14, 19, 26.

Q. What are the things which thou do believe?
A. I believe whatsoever is contained in the Scriptures, the chief points
whereof are contained in the Articles of the Christian says.

Q. Rehearse those Articles.
A. I believe in God the Father Almighty, etc.

Q. What learnest thou in general out of these Articles?
A. Three things. 1. How to believe rightly. 2. How to live godly. 3. How to
cheer up my heart joyfully.

Q. First then show me how thou learnest hence to believe rightly: and that
thou may proceed in order, tell me how these Articles may be divided.
A. Into four parts. 1. We are taught what to believe concerning God the
Father: 2. Concerning God the Son: 3. Concerning God the Holy Ghost: 4
Concerning Gods Church, and the privileges thereto belonging.

Q. Seeing there is but one God, why namest thou Father, Son, and holy Ghost?
A. These three several persons are all but one and the same God, Deuteronomy. 6. 4.
Matthew. 3. 16. 2 Cor. 13. 13. 1 Ioh. 5. 7.

Q. What meanest A more exact definition, but obscure, is this. A person is a
substance reasonable, incommunicable, whole, and not subsisting in another:
Therefore no quality, and nothing void of life or reason, is a person. God or
man, or Angel in general is no person. Man's body alone, or his soul alone;
or Christ's manhood without his Godhead, is no person.
thou by a person?
A. One man, as Peter, one Angel, as Gabriel is a person: So in the Godhead,
the FATHER is One Person, the SON Another, and the HOLY GHOST Another
distinct Person.

Q. Which is the first part of the Creed?
A. I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth.

Q. What meanest thou by this, I believe in God?
A. This I mean, Gods Spirit assures me that God loves me, and will bless
me both in this world and in the world to come, Romans 8. 15, 16. Galat. 2. 20.
2. Tim. 4. 8. 1 Timothy 4. 8.

Q. Whose Father is God?
A. The Father of Christ, and of all the faithful, Ioh. 20. 17.

Q. What beleeuest thou of this God and Fathers
A. That he is a Spirit, Ioh. 4. 24. infinite in power, and likewise in
wisdom, justice, mercy, truth, and every way, Genesis 17. 1. Exo. 3. 14. Exodus
34. 6. Job 12. 13. 1 Timothy 1. 17. and 6. 15, 16.

Q. How does this appear?
A. In that he made heaven, earth, and all therein, all of nothing, Genesis 1. 1.
all very good, Genesis 1. 31. and all for his own glory, Prou. 16. 4. Romans 11. 33.

Q. If God made all good, how is it that devils and ungodly men are so wicked?
A. God made them good, but by their fall they have made themselves wicked,
Ioh. 8. 44. Jude 6. Eccles. 7. 31. Genesis 3. 6.

Q. How does it further appear that God is infinite?
A. In that he governs the world and all things therein by his wonderful
providence, Prou. 16. 33. Matt. 10. 29, 30.

Q. If God does govern all by his providence, how is it that the godly often
mourn, and the wicked often rejoice?
A. God will turn the sorrows of the godly into joy, and the joys of the
wicked into sorrow, Luke 6. 20. 24. Luke 16. 25. John 16. 20. and in the mean
time, the godly do profit by their afflictions, Psalm. 119. 67, 71. 2 Cor. 4.
17, 18. Hebr. 12. 11.

Q. Rehearse the second part of the Creed.
A. And in Jesus Chrst, that is, I believe in Jesus Christ his only Son our
Lord, etc.

Q. What is Jesus Christ?
A. God Almighty, and man consisting of soul and body.

Q. Why must he be God?
A. That he might be able of himself to satisfy Gods justice for all our
sins, to merit heaven for us, to send us the Holy Ghost, to overcome sin,
death, Satan, tyrants, and all the mighty enemies of his Church, Psalm. 98. 1.
Heb. 1. 3. Heb. 7. 25. Act. 20. 28.

Q. Why must he be man?
A. That he might suffer for man, and that he might pity us, having had
experience of our miseries, Heb. 2. 16, 17, 18. and 4. 15.

Q. Which Person of the three became man?
A. God the Son, the second Person in the Trinity, Ioh. 1. 14. Ioh. 3. 16.

Q. What does JESUS signify?
A. A Savior, because he only saves his people from their sins, Matthew. 1.
21. Acts 4. 12.

Q. What does Messiah or Christ signify?
A. Anointed, for God by his Spirit anointed Him to be our King to govern us,
our Priest to offer up Himself for a Sacrifice, and to make intercession for
us, our Prophet to declare Gods will unto us, Psalm. 2. 2. Luke 1. 33. Psalm.
110. 4. Esa. 61. 1. Deuteronomy. 18. 15. That he might make us also kings and priests
unto God, and enable us to instruct others in the will of God, Reu. 1. 6. Romans
15. 14.

Q. How is Christ Gods only Son, since all the faithful are his children?
A. God is the Father of Christ by nature, and our Father by grace, Matthew. 16.
16. Heb. 1. 5, 6. 2 Cor. 6. 18.

Q. Why addest thou, Our LORD?
A. He has created and redeemed us, he is our best and greatest Master, Psalm.
95. 6, 7. 1 Cor. 8. 5, 6. Romans 14. 8, 9. 1 Cor. 6. 19. Act. 2. 36.

Q. What beleeuest thou concerning Christ's conception and birth?
A. That he was borne of a mother, without a Father miraculously.

Q. Why so?
A. That he might not be conceived and borne in sin as we are, Psalm. 51. 5.
Heb. 4. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 19.

Q How diuidest thou the Articles that follow concerning Christ?
A. They contain partly his humiliation, and partly his exaltation.

Q. Rehearse those Articles that contain his humiliation.
A. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried, he
descended into hell.

Q. Did Christ, when he lived upon the earth, live in pomp, riches, ease and
pleasures?
A. No: but in poverty, labor and persecution, Esaias 53. 1, 1. Mat. 8. 20. Heb.
2. 10.

Q. What death died he, and how?
A. His enemies of malice accused him before Pontius Pilate the Judge, who to
pleasure them, condemned him to death, even to the bitter, shameful, and
cursed death of the Cross, Gal. 3. 13. Phil. 2. 8.

Q. Died he willingly or against his will?
A. Most willingly, because he knew that God his Father had so decreed, and
because his purpose was by his own death to kill sin in us, and save us from
eternal death, shame and torment, Romans 6. 6. Heb. 2. 14. 15. Heb. 10. 14.

Q. What beleeuest thou concerning his burial and his descending into hell?
A. To assure us of his death, his body was buried, and continued till the
third day under the dominion of death, that he might deliver us from
the-dominion thereof, Heb. 2. 14, 15.

Q. Rehearse the Articles that contain Christ's exaltation.
A. The third day he rose again from the dead, he ascended into heaven, and
sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, from thence shall he
come to judge the quick and the dead.

Q. What beleeuest thou here?
A. That by the power of his Godhead, he raised his dead body to life again
the third day, and that, a glorious life, Ioh. 10. 18. 1 Pet. 3. 18. Matthew. 28.
1.

Q. Why did he so?
A. That he might show the same power on us, by raising our souls now from
sin, and our bodies hereafter from the grave, Romans 1. 4. 1 Cor. 15. 20. Phil.
3. 10.

Q. Go on to his Ascension.
A. Forty days after his Resurrection, he ascended visibly in soul and body
into heaven, Acts 1.

Q. Why did he so?
A. That we whiles we line, may through his quickening spirit, ascend by
heavenly affections, Col. 3. 1, 2. that at our death, our souls may ascend and
be with Christ, Phil. 1. 23. Luke 16. 22. Revel. 14. 13. Luke 23. 43 and that
at the last day, we may both in soul and body ascend and live with him for
ever, Ioh. 14. 2. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 17.

Q. How does Christ sit at Gods right hand? has God the Father a right hand
and a left, and other parts of a man's body, as many imagine?
A. Their imagination is foolish and wicked: for his sitting there does
signify, that the same Christ that was so greatly humbled, is now exalted
above all men and Angels, Ephesians. 1. 20, 21, 22.

Q. What profit have we thereby?
A. This, that he can and does defend us from all enemies, makes intercession
for us, Romans 8. 31, 34. and sends us the Holy Ghost, Ioh. 16. 7. Acts. 2. 33.
and the Ministers of his Word, Matthew. 28. 18. 19. 20. Ephe. 4. 10. 11.

Q. What beleeuest thou concerning his coming to Judgment.
A. He will come from heaven in glory, with all his holy Angels, and all men
shall give account to him, of all their thoughts, words and deeds, Matthew 25.
31. 1 Cor. 4. 5. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Matthew. 12. 36. Acts 17. 31. Eccles. 12. 14.

Q. Which is the third part of the Belief?
A. I believe in the Holy Ghost.

Q. What is the Holy Ghost?
A. God, the third person in Trinity, Acts 5. 3, 4. proceeding from the Father
and the Son Ioh. 15. 26. Gal. 4. 6. who does direct, sanctify, and comfort the
faithful, Ioh. 16. 13. Romans 1. 4. and 8. 9, etc. Gal. 5. 22. Ioh. 14. 16.

Q. Of these three Persons, is any one greater then another, or in time before
another?
A. No: but they are all equal and coeternall.

Q. Rehearse the fourth part of the Belief.
A. I believe the holy Catholic Church, etc.

Q. What is this holy Catholic Church?
A. The whole number of those, whom God, before the world began, decreed to
sanctify in this life, and to glorify in the next life, with Christ their
Head, Ephesians. 1. 4, 5. Ephesians. 5. 25, 26, 27.

Q. What has God decreed of the rest of mankind?
A. To let them run on in the course of sin, unto endless damnation, Romans
9. 13, 22.

Q. If God has of old decreed every man's salvation or damnation, then a man
elected shall be saved, live he never so wickedly, and areprobate shall be
damned, live he never so godly?
A. It is a foolish and a wicked thing to imagine that any reprobate can live
or die godly, or that God will suffer any of his elect to live and die wickedly.

Q. How then conceiuest thou of this matter?
A. Thus, that God in ordaining the end, ordains fit means withal:
therefore he decrees, that the elect, by faith and the fruits thereof, shall
obtain salvation; as the reprobate by their infidelity and the fruits thereof,
do purchase their own damnation; Esaias 38. 5, 21 Matthew. 2. 13. Acts 27. 24, 31.
Mark. 16. 16.

Q. Proceed to the privileges of the Church: what beleeuest thou concerning
the Communion of Saints?
A. This Church or body of Christ consists of many members, all which receive
the same spiritual life from their head, and are helpful as fellow members
one to another, Ephesians. 4. 4, 5, 6. 1 Cor. 12. 26.

Q. What further beleeuest thou?
A. That every Saint has all his sins forgiven him by the death of Christ,
and shall at the last day rise again with his own body, and live for ever
with Christ in heaven in perfect happiness, Matthew. 25. 34.

Q. If it shall be thus only with Saints, what then shall become of the wicked,
which are by far the greater number?
A. They also shall rise again, every one of them with his own body, but to
this end, to be tormented in hell for ever with the devil and his angels,
Matthew. 25. 41.

Q. Hitherto thou have showed how this Creed teaches us to believe rightly:
show further how thou art taught by the same to live godly: declare this out of
the first part.
A. He that truly believes that God is his Almighty Father, will truly love,
fear, obey, and trust in him, Mal. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 1. 14, 17. Matthew. 6. 32. 1
Pet. 5. 7. he will resemble his Father in righteousness and true holiness,
Ephesians. 5. 1. Ephesians. 4. 24. he will patiently bear all his corrections, Heb.
12. 5.

Q. Declare this in the second part.
A. He that believes that Christ died for him and rose again, by the same
power and spirit of Christ, working in him, dies daily unto sin, and is
quickened unto righteousness, Romans 1. 4. and 6. 3, 4, 5, 6. Phil. 3. 10.

Q. Declare this in the third part.
A. He that truly believes in the Holy Ghost, finds himself to be anointed
and sealed by him, and that he has received him of God as a pledge of his
salvation, 2 Cor 1. 21, 22. Ephesians. 1. 13, 14.

Q. Proceed to the fourth part.
A. He that is a member of Christ's mystical body, must and will show by his
conversation, that Christ lives in him; he that is a Saint will love Saints
entirely, and help them to his power; he that has his sins forgiven him,
and is washed by the blood of Christ, will not return with the dog to his
vomit, and with the sow to wallow in the mire, but will wait earnestly for a
glorious Resurrection and Ascension, he will not for the short and imperfect
pleasures, riches and honors of this life, lose those perfect and endless
joys, which God has prepared for him in heaven, Phil. 3. 20, 21.

Q. Thou said that by this Creed thou art taught to cheer up thy heart with
joy: declare this in the first part.
A. God is my Almighty Father, by this I am more happy than if any earthly king
were my father. What riches, what honor, what delight, what other good thing
can I want that he sees expedient for me, Esaias 49. 15. Matthew. 7. 11. 1 Pet. 5.
7. Luke 12 32. Romans 8. 17. his wisdom is my direction, his power is my
protection, against the craft and power of all mine enemies.

Q. Declare this in the second part.
A. Christ died for me, rose again and ascended into heaven for me, and now
makes intercession for me, my SAVIOVR and none other shall be my Judge, what
need I then fear affliction, or sin, or hell or death? Romans 8. 31. to 39.

Q. Proceed to the third and fourth part.
A. All wicked men and devils cannot grieve me, so much as the Holy Ghost can
and does comfort me: I am a member of the Church Christ's mystical body; what
sins, what sorrows, what enemies bodily or ghostly can rent me asunder from
my Head?

Q. Go on to the Communion of Saints and the rest.
A. Though I am a sinner, yet am I also a Saint: all Saints on earth pray for
me, as I do for them, effectually. All Saints that know my estate, are ready to
help and comfort me, as I am to help and comfort them; my sins are washed
away by the blood of Christ; I shall rise gloriously, I shall ascend with
Christ triumphantly, and with him enjoy for ever those joys which my dull
heart cannot now conceive, nor yet the least part of them. Even so, come LORD
JESUS.

Q. Then thou esteemest this faith of thine, to be an inestimable treasure?
A. Yea verily, for without this faith, if I had millions of wealth, I should
be most unhappy, and in the way to endless and intolerable shame and torments;
but with this faith though poverty, sickness, persecution, and al temporal
crosses light upon me, yet have I great cause to rejoice in God, who is my
portion for ever.

Q. How is this faith of thine preserved and increased?
A. By Prayer, by the Sacraments, and by continual meditation in the Word of
God.

Q. Rehearse the Lords Prayer.
A. Our Father which art in heaven, etc.

Q. Why is it called the Lords Prayer?
A. Because Christ, our Lord and Master, taught it us.

Q. What gather we hence?
A. Great comfort, in that the Son of God himself has framed and indighted
our petitions for us, and is ever ready to present us and our prayers before
God his Father.

Q. How may it be fitly divided?
A. Into a preface, petitions, and a conclusion.

Q. Which is the Preface?
A. Our Father which art in Heaven.

Q. What learnest thou by this Preface?
A. I learn four things: First, that we must pray for others as well as for
our selves, Ephesians. 6. 18. 1. Tim. 2. 1.

Secondly, that God is a loving Father to the godly, and willing to help them,
Esaias 49. 15. Psalm. 103. 13. Matthew. 7. 11.

Thirdly, that God is a heavenly and powerful Father, able to help his
children, Esa. 51. 12, 13. Psalm. 115 3. and therefore we must pray in faith and
full assurance to be heard.

Fourthly, that we must not pray with profane, carnal, and earthly hearts, but
with reverence to Gods Majesty, and with heavenly affections, Genes. 28. 16,
17. 1 King. 8. 22. Eccles. 5. 1. Ioh. 11. 41.

Q. How many petitions are there in the Lords Prayer?
A. Six.

Q. What desire thou in the three first petitions?
A. Those things which belong immediately to God.

Q. What desire thou in the three last petitions?
A. Those things that are needful for our selves, both for body and soul.

Q. Which is the first petition?
A. Hallowed be thy Name.

Q. What desire we in this petition?
A. First, that God may have praise for all his worthiness; as for his power,
wisdom, justice, and mercy, Exodus 34. 6, 7. 1 Chronicles. 29. 10, 11, 12. Reu. 4.
8, 9, 10, 11. Reu. 5. 12, 13.

Secondly, that God may have thanks for all his benefits; as for our health
and peace, food and raiment, for our election, creation, redemption, vocation,
assurance of glorification, and for the comfort of his most holy word, Psalm.
103. and 104. Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 9. Ephesians. 5. 20.

Q. Which is the second petition?
A. Thy Kingdom come.

Q. What desire we in this petition?
A. First, we desire that God would convert the wicked, Psalm. 51. 13. and 67.
2. Matt. 3. 2. and 4. 17.

Secondly, that God would increase his graces in the godly, Ephesians. 1. 17, 18,
19. Ephesians. 3. 16 17, 18, 19.

Thirdly, that God would advance his Kingdom, by sending godly Magistrates and
Ministers, and specially by Christ's coming to judgment, 1 Timothy 2. 2. Mat. 9.
38. Reu. 23. 20.

Q. Which is the third petition?
A. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.

Q. What desire we in this petition?
A. We pray that God would enable us, to walk in the way of all his
Commandments: And that Magistrates and people, Ministers and hearers, husbands
and wives, parents and children, masters and servants, may perform those
duties of their several callings, which they owe one to another, Ephesians. 4. 1.
and 5. 21, 22, etc.

Q. What mean these words, In earth as it is in heaven?
A. We desire grace to do Gods will gladly and cheerfully, as the Angels in
heaven do the same, Psalm. 103. 20, 21.

Q. Which is the fourth petition?
A. Give us this day our daily bread.

Q. What desire we in this petition?
A. We pray, that God would give us food, raiment, health, peace, and all
things needful for this present life. That he would stir us up to labor and
diligence, that he would keep us from sloth and idleness, and give a
blessing to our honest endeavors.

Q. What learnest thou further from the words of this petition?
A. First, that whatsoever we lawfuly possess, is Gods gift, Deuteronomie 8.
17, 18. Habac. 1. 16.

Secondly, that we must have a feeling of other men's wants, as well as of our
own, and show it by charitable deeds, Heb. 13. 3.

Thirdly, that if we have maintenance only for the time present, and none for
the time to come, we must be content, and depend on Gods providence, Matthew. 6.
25.

Fourthly, that although we live not in ease, plenty, and pleasure, yet if we
have things necessary, we must be content, Genesis 28. 20. 1 Timothy 6. 8.

Q. Which is the fifth petition?
A. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us.

Q. What desire we in this petition?
A. We pray that God would forgive us all our sins, original and actual, of
commission and omission, secret and open, whether known or unknown even to
our selves, Psalm. 51. Psalm. 19. 12.

And that he would not only pardon our sinful deeds, but all our wicked,
unprofitable, and idle words, all our sinful purposes, and all our desires,
joys, fears and griefs, that are against the love of God and of our
neighbor, Ecc. 11. 9. and 12. 14. Matthew. 12. 36.

And further, that God would give us grace, truly to examine our selves, to
discern our sins, to confess them, to hate and forsake them.

Q. Why is this added, As we forgive them that trespass against us?
A. To teach us to forgive all wrongs, to end our quarrels, and to be free from
malice, or else God will not forgive us, Matthew. 5. 23. and 6. 14, 15. and 18.
23.

Q. Which is the sixth petition?
A. And lead us not into tentation, but deliver us from evil.

Q. What desire we in this petition?
A. We pray that God would not suffer the devil, nor the world to prevail
against us, nor our own corruptions to prevail within us, but that he would
give us strength to overcome them, Ephesians. 4. 22. and 6. 10, 11. 1 Ioh. 5. 4. That
we may be wise to discern when Satan tempts us to those things which seem
to be no sins, Matthew. 4. 3, 6. or when he uses our own friends for his
instruments to deceive us, Genesis 3. 6. Mat. 16. 22, 23.

Q. Which is the conclusion of the Lords prayer?
A. For thine is the Kingdom, the power and the glory, for ever and ever, Amen.

Q. What is the meaning of this conclusion?
A. Because God is our gracious King, and careful for his subjects, and seeing
his power is such, that he can give us all good things, and defend us from all
evil, 1 Chr. 29. 10, 11. 2 Chr. 20. 6. Psalm. 62. 11. and 115. 1. 1. Tim. 1.
17. Reu. 4. 11 and 5. 12, 13.

And seeing the things we have prayed for, are for his own glory, therefore we
earnestly desire, and steadfastly believe that he will grant them unto us. Amen
let it be so, yea without doubt it shall be so.

Q. How do the wicked pray this prayer?
A. They show their vile hypocrisy in every part thereof.

Q. How do they show their hypocrisy in the preface?
A. They call God Father, and yet have no assurance of his love, nor care to
please him, but show themselves to be his enemies, and children of the devil,
Ioh. 8. 44. 1 Ioh. 3. 8.

Q. How do they show their hypocrisy in the three first petitions?
A. They dishonor God, they despise his justice, power and providence.

They take part with evil men in evil causes, and so contend and fight for
Satan and his kingdom, against Christ and his subjects, Psalm. 2. 1, 2, 3. Luke
19. 14.

They reject Gods will, and do their own, they follow their own lusts, they
imitate not Angels in heaven, but beasts on earth, or devils in hell.

Q. How do they show their hypocrisy in the rest of the petitions?
A. Daily bread contents them not, their wealth is evil gotten, or evil spent.

They ask pardon of sin, but have no purpose nor desire to leave the same.

They forgive not wrongs received, but bear malice against Gods children,
which have not wronged them.

They are not wary against temptations, but run on boldly: thus their prayer is
contrary to the whole course of their life.

Q. Then none but a sincere Christian truly called and converted, can pray this
prayer or the like, with understanding, and with an unfeigned desire?
A. It is even so, and therefore this prayer being rightly understood, is a
perfect trial of a man's true conversion, Romans 8. 15, 16.

Q. Thou say that thy faith is preserved and increased by the Sacrament: what
is a Sacrament?
A. Gods seal of his covenant made with the faithful and their seed, Genesis 17.
7, 8, 9, 10. Romans 4. 11.

Q. In this Covenant, what does God undertake on his part?
A. To defend the faithful in all dangers, to give them all good things
expedient for them, to cause all things to work for their good, and to crown
them with eternal glory, Genesis 15. 1. and 17. 1. Psalm. 84. 11. 1 Timothy 4. 8. Romans
8. 28.

Q. What do the faithful undertake for their part?
A. Not to follow their own lusts, nor the worlds allurements, nor evil
examples, nor the devils tentations, but readily to obey all Gods
Commandments, Ephesians. 4. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, etc. Tit. 2. 11, 12. 1
Pet. 2. 9. Romans 12. 1, 2. Luc. 1. 72, 73, 74, 75.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?
A. Two: Baptism, and the Lords Supper.

Q. What is Baptism?
A. Gods seal, whereby we enter into Covenant with him, by the washing of our
souls from sin through Christ's blood, as our bodies are washed with water,
Romans 4. 11. Ephesians. 5. 26. Tit. 3. 5. Col. 2. 12.

Q. What is the Lords Supper?
A. Gods seal, whereby we renew our Covenant with him, whereby our souls are
nourished and comforted with the body and blood of Christ, as our bodies are
with the Bread and Wine, 1 Cor. 10. 16. and 11. 24, 25. 26.

Q. Do all that come to the Lords Supper receive profit thereby?
A. No: for all unworthy receivers receive much hurt thereby, 1 Cor. 11. 17,
27, 29.

Q. Who are unworthy receivers?
A. 1. All that are carnal and unregenerate.

2. The godly themselves, when they come with security, having offended God,
and neglecting to renew their repentance, 2 Samuel 11. 27. 1 Cor. 11. 30.

Q. How must thou prepare thy self for the Lords Supper?
A. I must examine my self,

1. Whether I repent me truly of all my sins past.

2. Whether I steadfastly purpose to lead a new life.

3. Whether I have a lively faith in Gods mercy through Christ.

4. Whether I remember and meditate on Christ's death with thankfulness.

5. Whether I be in charity with all men, freely forgiving them all wrongs
done against me, as God for Christ's sake has freely forgiven me.

Q. Thou say that thy faith is preserved and increased by continual
meditation in the Word of God: show me then to what end, and in what manner
ought thou both to read Gods word, and to hear it preached?
A. Not for fashions sake to seem religious, but with a sincere purpose,
earnest desire, constant endeavor, and fervent prayer, that thereby my faith
may be strengthened, my life amended, and my soul comforted, 1 Cor. 14. 3. 2.
Tim. 3. 16. Psalm. 19. Psalm. 119.

And further, I must beware of malice against the Preacher, and of a
preiudicate opinion of his person or gifts, of pride and selfewill; I must
read and hear with an humble heart: so that when the Word shows me any
error of mine, in judgment or practice, on the right hand, or on the left, I
must be ready to reform it, 1 Pet. 2. 1, 2. James 1. 21, 22. etc.

Q. What if the Preacher deliver things unsound or unprofitable?
A. I must pray, that I may with wisdom discern, and with modesty refuse the
same; but ever I must beware, that I be not a rash and proud censurer of any
man, specially of Gods messengers, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 21. Matthew. 7. 1. Iam. 3. 1. Iam.
1. 19, 20.

Q. How ought thou to prepare thy self for death at all times, and
specially in time of sickness?
A. After the same manner as I ought to prepare my self to receive the Lords
Supper, so that if I recover, I must walk the more circumspectly afterward.

MORNING PRAYER for a Family.
A brief Confession with thanksgiving.
WE most humbly present our selves, O LORD, before the Throne of thy great
Majesty, in the name of thy beloved Son our only Savior, confessing that of
our selves we are most vile, polluted with sins original and actual, sins
against thee and against our neighbor, sins of omission and commission, secret
and open, known and unknown even to our selves. O let them not make a
separation betwixt thee and us, seeing thou art reconciled unto us, and not
only so, but also thou have vouchsafed to become our loving Father, having
redeemed us by thy Sons blood, and adopted us by his Spirit, whom thou have
sent into our hearts: thou have also fed, clothed, and lodged us, thou have
strengthened and preserved us even to this hour; therefore for all thy mercies
so many and so great, we praise and bless thy holy name. And now, Lord, as
thou have raised our bodies from sleep, so raise up our hearts from their
natural dullness and earthly disposition: Sanctify us more and more in soul
and body, that every day we may grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ,
by the works of the Spirit.

O Lord increase our faith, give us yet more assurance of that thy Prayer for
strength of faith.
eternal love, that therein we may rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious,
and obediently wait for the performance of all thy promises, both to provide
for us, and to defend us in this life, and after to crown us with eternal
glory. Let this assurance be such, that thereby we may be able to endure all the miseries and trials of this mortal pilgrimage, not only with patience and
quietness, but also with heavenly comfort.

And teach us, O Lord, to love thee, and that sincerely, that our Prayer for
love to God.
false hearts may not go a whoring after the world, whiles we foolishly and
wickedly admire the riches, and pleasures, and pride of this life, and suffer
our selves to be snared therewith. O let us know, that the love of thy glorious
Majesty, and of these vile things, cannot stand together. As we desire to
love thee sincerely, so to love thee abundantly, that we may be the better
assured that we love thee, let not our love be as a spark of fire covered
with the ashes of our dark and earthly corruptions, but let it be as burning
coals, and as a vehement flame.

And let it appear by our hearty love to our neighbor, specially Prayer for
love to our neighbor.
to those, whose good fruits declare them to be thy faithful children. Suffer
us not this day, nor hereafter, to be injurious to any by deceit or
oppression, by slandering or backbiting those that are absent, by reproching
or disgracing those that are present, or by any other wrongs, but let us be
profitable and helpful to many, to the uttermost of our power. Grant that we
may instruct those that are more ignorant then our selves, let us relieve,
according as thou have enabled us, those that stand in need of our help.

O Lord, preserve us from the damnable error of those that Against counterfeit
happiness
place their greatest happiness in worldly wealth and pleasure, open our eyes
to discern yet more clearly, that if thou be our riches, then we shall be
rich indeed, if thou be our delight, then shall we perceive how vile and vain
all carnal delights are: Let us know how good a thing it is to draw near unto
thee, by hearing thy voice in thy most holy Word, and by speaking to thee in
our prayers and thanksgiving; withdraw not thy Spirit from us, give us not over
unto Satan and worldly lusts, for then shall we run headlong into all sin
and misery.

This that follows, is very needful in many houses of the Gentry and
richer sort.
LOrd, preserve this family from the sins of idleness, pride, fullness of
bread, from contempt or neglect of the poor, from foolish and corrupt
communication, from chambering and wantonness, from excessive and unseasonable
eating and drinking, from loving of pleasures more than thee, the chiefest Good.

In a mean and laborious Family, prayer to this purpose will be convenient.
WE beseech thee cheer us up, and comfort us in the midst of our labors
and travels, let us not admire or envy the happiness of those that abound
with ease and wealth, but ever let us remember, that a painful and godly life
is the way to perfect rest and endless joy, that an idle, voluptuous, and
unprofitable life, is the way to bitter and endless pain, that thou did
consecrate Christ Jesus the Prince of our salvation, through afflictions, that
they are blessed that mourn, for they shall be comforted.

In what family soever, thus proceed.
O Gracious Father, according to thy love and thy Prayer for earthly blessings.
merciful promises in Christ, vouchsafe unto us now and hereafter, that
measure of wealth, and such health, peace, liberty, and credit, as may be most
expedient for us in our several callings, and for the better discharge of our
duty to thee and our brethren.

Scotland, and Ireland: grant that as the sins of all sorts and degrees
amongst us, have been many and very grievous in thy sight; so our earnest

judgments may be stayed, before thy wrath break forth against us.

Protect with thy providence, direct with thy Spirit, For the Kings Majesty,

grace to the Magistrates, that they may truly and diligently execute justice
and judgment; to the Bishops and Ministers, that they may by diligent and
effectual preaching, and godly example of life, proceed to build up thy Church
amongst us; root out idle and idol shepherds, increase the number of
faithful Pastors. Let thy rich blessings be powered down upon all sorts and
degrees, to the praise of thy Name, through JESUS CHRIST our Lord and Savior,
in whose Name, for these and all other good things needful for us and all thy
servants whosoever, we pray as he has taught us.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc. Evening Prayer for a Family.
O Most gracious God, and merciful Father in Jesus Christ, we humble our
selves before thy Majesty, confessing and bewailing the sins of our whole
life, and specially of this present day.

Pardon, O LORD, our disordered affections, which have Prayer for the
forgiveness of sins.
been too carnestly bent upon the profits and pleasures of this present life.
Forgive us whatsoever sinful anger thou have beheld in us, and our inordinate
grief at worldly crosses, when as we are not duly grieved for our sins, and
the sins of this Land, and of this age, and for the afflictions of our dear
brethren. Forgive our carnal joy, which is so strong when earthly things
answer our desires, and so weak and feeble, when we consider those
spiritual, infinite, and eternal blessings, wherewith thou have blessed us in
heavenly things in Christ. Pass by, whatsoever uncharitable, unprofitable, or
unsavory talk, has proceeded from any of us, with neglect of that
admonition, or instruction, or consolation, which we should have ministered one
to another. O pardon, for thy mercy sake, our neglect and omission of works of
piety toward thee, or of mercy toward our neighbor, and all our idleness.

O forgive our excess, and our abuse, of meat, drink, sleep, recreations,
all our intemperance, and disordering of mind or body, in making them unfit
for thy service, and for the duties of our several callings. O forgive those
our imperfections and corruptions, that are mixed with our best actions, and do
defile the same.

And specially forgive our unthankfulness for thy many and A Thanksgiving.
great mercies; grant that hereafter, we may ever stir up our dull hearts,
that they may be inflamed with love to thee, that have elected us to salvation,
and created us after thy own image, that have redeemed us, with the
inestimable price of thy dearest Sons blood, that have called us effectually
by thy Word and Spirit, from the power of darkness unto the kingdom of thy
dear Son, not only reconciling us that were thine enemies, but also making
us thy dear and glorious children, and heirs of thy heavenly kingdom.

O teach us to walk worthy Prayer for diverse graces, and against sin.
of this vocation whereto thou have called us; instruct us ever by thy Word,
work on our hearts effectually by thy Spirit, that we may discern and daily
reform our grievous corruptions, that we may not flatter nor please our selves
in any of our sins, nor walk on securely and carelessly, but that we may
strive for, and attain unto more power to subdue and conquer our carnal
lusts, to resist the allurements of this world, and the evil examples of the
multitude, that we be not any more carried away herewith, as with a violent
stream. Open our eyes to discern the nets which Satan lays to ensnare us,
in eating, in drinking, in talking, in sporting, in buying, in selling, in
giving or receiving counsel, in pleasing some, in offending others, that we
might displease thy Majesty, and kindle thy wrath against us.

And whereas there are so many diversities of opinions in the world, and yet
but one truth, O guide and direct us in the same by thy Spirit of truth; build
us firmly on thy Son Christ, that sure foundation. O let us not depart from
any truth, nor be stiff in any error which we have held: Let us not hate
those that dissent from us in some points, yet building their faith on Christ;
grant that we may follow the truth in love, and in all things grow up unto
CHRIST the Head. Make us devout and religious toward thee, and obedient to our
superiors. Stir us up that we may be helpful and profitable to many; Let us
not be deceitful, or otherwise injurious to any, in word or deed. Make us
charitable, meek, and patient, toward all. Let not our faith be dead, like
the faith of Devils, but a working faith, as the faith of Abraham and of Rahab,
that loved dearly thee and thy children, and showed their faith by their
works. Thus let us walk all our days till our change shall come. Let our last
days be our best days. Let not the remembrance of death be grievous or
terrible unto us. Make us desirous to be dissolved, and to be with Christ. Come
Lord JESUS, come quickly, perfect thine own glory, and thy servants happiness.

In the mean time, behold in mercy thy dear Prayer for Gods Church, etc.
Spouse whom thou have redeemed with thy precious blood. Confirm and establish
thy servants, weaken and withstand thy foes, confound their malice, their pride
and their hellish plots and devices. Stir up thy strength and come and help
us. O bless, preserve, direct and prosper our Sovereign King; be merciful to
the Queen, to our hopeful Prince Charles, the Prince and Princess Palatine
with their Issue, the honorable Privy Counselors, Nobles and Magistrates, the
Bishops and Ministers; the Universities and Nurseries of learning.

Among all sorts, stir up those that may valiantly fight thy battles against
the Devil, and against this world that lies in wickedness.

prosper us in our health, our credit, and in our worldly estate. Above all, let
us grow rich in godliness, sobriety and righteousness. Give us this night
quiet rest, and safety; raise us up again in due time, that we may the next
day, and so from day to day do thee acceptable service, and glorify thee in
our several callings: For these and for all good things needful for us and
for all thy children, we pray as thy Son our Savior has taught us. Our

A Prayer upon the Lords Prayer.
O Lord our God, thy Son our Savior has assured Upon the Preface.
us that thou art through him a loving Father to the godly, and willing to
help them, and that thou art an heavenly and powerful Father, always able to
comfort them, therefore we come unto thee with boldness and confidence through
faith in him, and we desire and endeavor to pray unto thee now and hereafter,
not with profane, carnal, and earthly hearts, but with reverence to thy divine
Majesty, and with heavenly affections. O help us and strengthen us, and raise
up our souls from earth and earthly things, to thee that dwell on high.

Pharao and the Egyptians. But let thy servants and faithful people know thee
to their comfort. Let them sanctify thee in their hearts, let them ever
believe and also find by joyful experience, that thy power is their
protection, thy wisdom their direction, thy justice their deliverance from
all wrongs.

And let all praise and thanks be given unto thee for all thy benefits, for our
health and peace, for our food and raiment, for thy great favors so
extraordinary bestowed upon this land for many years, and for those which we
in particular have received, and do enjoy from thy bountiful hand, and
specially for those heavenly and spiritual blessings, our election,
redemption, vocation, assurance of glorification, and for the comfort of thy
most holy Word.

thou have ordained for these euds. Raise up godly Kings, that may walk in the
steps of David, Ezekiah, Josiah, and religious Nobles, like Joseph, Obadiah,
Daniel, Nehemiah, Mordecai, that may administer justice, and maintain truth,
and seek the prosperity of Israel-Increase, we pray thee, the number of
faithful Pastors and teachers, endue them with excellent gifts of Learning and
Godliness, that they may be able to convince heresies and errors, to confound
every Iannes and Iambres, that shall resist thy truth. O let thy servants walk
in the steps of the Apostles and Prophets, and not in pride, covetousness, or
idleness. Unite them in thy truth, lest by their divisions thy people be also
divided; grant that they may be knit together in one mind and in one
judgment, that with one mind, and with one mouth they may praise thy name.
And let us earnestly wait for thy coming to judgment, that thou may put all
thine enemies under thy feet, and reign for ever in perfect peace, that we
may reign with thee triumphantly.

wills that are so foolish, so perverse and wicked. Teach us to walk in the
way of all thy Commandments; let our hearts be seasoned with godliness, let
us love thee above all, let us fear thee and ever walk in all sincerity as
in thy sight and presence; let us trust in thee, and rest upon thy promises for
the things of this life and of the life to come. Let it be our chief delight
to speak to thee by prayer and thanksgiving and to hear thee speaking unto us
by thy word both read and preached. Enable us by thy grace to obey thee in
those general duties that belong to all Christians, and in the particular
duties of our several callings; grant that Magistrates and people, Ministers
and hearers, husbands and wives, parents and children, masters and servants,
may conscionably, and in hearty obedience unto thee, perform those duties
which they owe one to another. Grant that in whatsoever profession, trade or
course of life thou have placed us, we may not live to our selves, but make
this our special end, to please and to glorify thee.

And whereas the wicked perform heavenly duties in earthly manner, defiling
their prayers, and thy word and Sacraments by their hypocrisy, grant that we
may perform not only heavenly, but also earthly duties and businesses in a
heavenly manner, walking cheerfully in our vocations, endeavoring with all our
might to do thy Majesty acceptable service every day, and to be through thy
grace profitable members of the Church, Commonwealth, and family where we
live. Direct us, and enable us that we on earth may do thy work and business
wisely, and also gladly and cheerfully, with strength and courage, fearing no
adversary, ever beholding thy face, and following the pattern of thy heavenly
Angels.

thing wrongfully, give us grace to make restitution. Neither pray we against
our own wants only, but also against the wants of other men, specially of all
thy dear children. O let them see and feel thy fatherly affection and
providence over them, and let us to our power be helpefull unto them, cutting
off all vain and vicious, all proud and luxurious expenses, that we may have
the more to bestow upon charitable uses. And though we have maintenance but for
the present time, and none for the time to come, let us be content and depend
on thy providence; for thou do cloth the Lillies, and feed the Birds, but
we are of much more value than they, and the hairs of our head are numbered:
why should we that are thy flock, fear either want or other miseries, since
it is thy pleasure to give us a Kingdom? Thou that have not spared thine own
Son, but have given him for us all unto the death, how should thou not
with him give us all good things also? Keep us therefore from all pensive and
distrustful cares; let us remember, that as no man can add one cubit to his
stature, so no man can add one mite to that proportion of wealth which thou
have already determined to bestow upon every one. Therefore when we have used
lawful means, and done our due endeavor, let us quietly commit the success
of all unto thy providence, knowing that thou have appointed who shall be
poor, and who rich, that if thou withholdest from us earthly riches, thou
can make us rich in faith, which is far better. Therefore though we live
not in ease, plenty and pleasure, yet if we have things necessary, if we have
bread to eat, and clothes to put on, let us therewith be content, and the
rather, seeing that they which strive and toil to be rich, do fall into
tentations and snares, and into many foolish and noisome lusts, which drown
men in perdition and destruction. O Lord, we pray thee look with thy eye of
pity and compassion, on those that are afflicted with sickness, give them
patience under thy correcting hand, restore them to their former health, or
else prepare them for a better life. Have pity on thy servants that are
afflicted with grievous persecutions, or with horrible wars, and the terrors
and calamities that do accompany the same; O stop and stay this cruel
effusion of Christian blood, restore peace and tranquillity.

thy sight we freely forgive all wrongs and trespasses, we empty our hearts
of the poison of malice: if therefore we, whose goodness is but a drop, do thus
behave our selves toward them that have wronged us, much more thou that art a
sea of goodness and mercy, can and wilt pardon us; and hereof let us be
from thee most comfortably assured.

Eve against Adam, for his instruments to deceive us; Lord, thou know his
wiles and his depth; thou, O Savior, that have thy self encountered with this
dreadful enemy, know that if thou forsakest us, and withdrawest thy self
from us, we shall never be able to stand against him, and against all the
powers of darkness. Therefore make us strong in thee, and in the power of thy
might; bestow upon us the whole armor of God, and teach us to put it on us and
to use it, that in the evil day we may be able both to resist and to conquer.
Make us wary and watchful against our own false hearts, lest they betray us
into the hands of Satan: let us fight mightily every day against our manifold
corruptions; let us be faithful unto the death, that we may receive the
crown of life.

Hear, O Lord, incline thine ears The Conclusion.
to these requests of us thy humble subjects, for thou art our gracious King,
most careful for us, thou will not suffer us to become a prey unto thine
enemies. Thy power is such, that thou can give us all good things, and defend
us from all evil, and thou know that the things which we have prayed for,
are for thine own glory. Therefore we earnestly desire, and steadfastly
believe, that thou will grant them unto us. Amen, let it be so. Yea, without
doubt it shall be so as we have prayed: we beleene, Lord help our unbelief.

Unto thee, O Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be all honor and glory, now and
for ever. Amen.

A short Morning Prayer.
O Lord our God, most gracious and merciful Father in Jesus Christ, as thou
have bestowed upon us innumerable and inestimable benefits, so vouchsafe, we
beseech thee, to add this grace and mercy to the rest, that thou stir us up
and enable us by thy holy Spirit, to praise and magnify thy name both for our
rest and safety this night past, and for all the rest of thy mercies. Lord
open our eyes, and enlarge our hearts to praise thee for the forgiveness of
our sins, so many and so heinous, by the blood of thy Son, a price so
infinite and precious; for our Redemption from the thraldom of Satan, and from
those infinite and endless torments which with him we should have suffered,
and that by thy Word and thy holy Spirit thou have exalted us to be thy royal
children, and heirs of thy Kingdom. O give us grace this day and every day to
walk worthy of this vocation; renew and quicken our Repentance, humble our
hearts with the sight of our sins, confirm our faith in thy promises
temporal and spiritual; teach us to love thee fervently, to despise riches,
pleasures, pride, and all earthly vanities. Teach us obedience to our
superiors, and love to all men, even to our enemies, much more to all thy
dear children.

Preserve us and every one of us this day and every Here let those sins be
named which are most practiced in the family.
day from swearing, cursing, lying, from reproaching and slaundering, from
deceit and oppression, and all other offenses against thy Majesty, or against
our Neighbor, from idleness, gluttony, drunkenness, intemperance; from
chambering and wantonness, from strife and envy, from all sinful words or
deeds, from all unlawful attempts or purposes. O pardon all our sins past,
assure our souls of this forgiveness; give us grace to hate all manner of
sins in others, and specially in our selves, to be watchful over our ways,
to be constant in all good purposes.

O Lord, bless and defend thy universal Church, our Sovereign King, the
Queen, and all the Royal progeny, the Nobles and Magistrates, the Bishops and
Ministers. O be favorable and gracious to all that are near and dear to us,
direct and prosper every one of us in all our intended labors and businesses.
For these and all good things needful for us, and for all thy children, we
pray as our dear Savior has taught us;

Our Father which art in heaven, etc. A short Evening Prayer.
MOst gracious God, and merciful Father, we present our selves before thy
glorious Majesty, in the name and mediation of Jesus Christ, most humbly
beseeching thee for his sake, to forgive all the sins of this day, our
worldly affections, our inordinate and carking cares and griefs, our greedy
desire after earthly things, our ouer-valuing of these earthly vanities, and
our neglect of heavenly things: O pardon all our vain, unprofitable, and
unsavory talk, all omission of good duties, to thee or to our neighbor, all
our corruptions and defects, in those which we have taken in hand.

Forgive all the sinful acts of this day, and of our whole life: Grant that
we may search out our sins diligently, and discover them, and steadfastly
resolve to reform them without delay, and enable us by thy Spirit to perform
what we intend, that we may be constant in all good purposes and enterprises.

Grant that every day we may crucify the old man, that our natural pride,
malice, envy, strife, may die in us; that covetousness, infidelity, trust in
riches, or howsoever in the arm of flesh; that wanton lusts and desires may be
mortified in us, that idleness and voluptuous living may be hateful to us.
Grant that we may practice the contrary virtues, that humility before thee and
before men, that charity in forgiving wrongs in word or deed, and in helping
and releeuing the wants of our neighbors, may abound in us, that faith and
love, that temperance and sobriety, may shine bright in us, that we may be just
and faithful in our contracts and dealings with all men. Quicken us ever to
all religious duties, to prayer and thanksgiving, let us above all things
delight in the constant reading, hearing, and meditation of thy Word, assure us
of the pardon of our sins, of thy love and favor, and of our everlasting
salvation.

Let us every day think on death, on the resurrection, and the last Judgment,
and that not with horror and grief, but with great joy and comfort: Let us
unfeignedly desire, and every day prepare our selves to be with Christ.

Make us heartily thankful for all thy mercies, for public and private
benefits, so many and so great, for our food and raiment, our peace and safety,
and specially for our election, redemption, and effectual vocation.

Bless, O LORD, thy universal Church, comfort thy servants that are pinched
with want, those that are afflicted with war, persecutions, or with inward
tentations, or whatsoever tribulations.

Preserve and direct our sovereign King, bless the Queen, and all the Royal
Issue, the Nobles and Magistrates, the Bishops and Ministers, and the rest of
thy people. Bless and preserve this family, give us quiet rest and sleep,
raise us up in due time, to do thee service in our several places.

For these and all good things, we pray as thy Son our Savior has taught us,

Our Father which art in heaven, etc. A Prayer for a young Scholar, or any of
the younger sort, both Morning and Evening.
MOst gracious God and loving Father, I give thee most humble and hearty
thanks for all thy mercies; for choosing me to salvation, and redeeming me
with the precious blood of Christ my Savior, for calling me to this great
honor, to be one of the number of thy children, by working in my heart true
faith, and hatred of all sin, by thy holy Word both read and preached, and by
thy blessed Spirit. And I praise thy holy Name for my health, for my food and
raiment, for good nurture, and godly education, for my preservation this night
day
past, and at all times.

O Lord continue thy favor toward me, teach me to know thee, to love and
fear thee, to keep all thy Commandments. Let not the corruption of my
nature, nor the craft of Satan, nor evil company, nor any worldly vanity,
withdraw me from thee. Suffer me not to slide from thee into any false belief,
or an ungodly life, but instruct me in all truth and godliness, in all
sobriety and righteousness. O Lord, forgive me all my sins, teach me to
discern them, to hate and forsake them: grant that I may bestow upon thee all
the days of my youth, and so continue thy faithful servant to my lives end.

O Lord preserve thy Church, our Sovereign King, the Queen, and all the
Royal Issue, the Magistrates, and Ministers of thy Word, and all thy people.
Bless my dear Parents, brethren, sisters, and other friends; bless this
whole family; give me health, defend me from idleness, learning, business,
defend me in prosper my soul and body, this night day
and evermore. Amen.

Our Father which art in heaven, etc, Another Morning Prayer for a young
Scholar.
O Lord, my God and loving Father, I give thee humble thanks for all thy
benefits, for my sleep and safety this night, for my food and apparel, for
religious education, and for the precious treasure of thy most holy word. Lord
bless me this day and ever, give me health: Keep me from sin, prosper my
learning. Lord be merciful to my parents: grant I may honor them according to
thy Commandment, that by my weldoing I may be a comfort unto them: defend them
and me, and all this family, and all the rest of thy people in soul and body
this day and ever. Amen.

FINIS.
