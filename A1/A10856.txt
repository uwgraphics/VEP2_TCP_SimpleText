TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, SIR WILLIAM CECIL, Vicount Cranborne, Son and Heir
to the Right Honorable the Earl of SALISBVRIE, and Knight of the Honorable
order of the Bathe, Thomas Robinson wishes all happiness, with the increase
of all true Honor and Virtue.
WAlking in my Garden of good will (Right Honorable,) I could find no better
Flowers, then those that spring from faithful Love, bound with the bond of
duty, to make my labors gracious in your thoughts. Love to your Honor,
sprung from the root of your Lord and Grandfathers bountiful and most
Honorable kindness toward my Father, who was (until his dying day) his true
and obedient Servant. Duty binds me, for that I was my self sometimes
Servant unto the Right Honorable, THOMAS Earl of Excester, your Honors
uncle, and always have tasted of the comfortable liberality, of your Honors
Father; for whose sake (next under God) I crave your Honors Pardon, for this
my bold attempt. Thus breeding (Right Honorable) as it were a protection from
your Pardon: I most humbly leave you to the Lord, and betake my self to my
Prayers for your Honors health and prosperity in all condign dignity.

Your Honors to command in all duty. Thomas Robinson.

To the Reader.
GEntlemen, blame me not although J have been so long cracking of this nutte,
since at last J have given you the sweetest Cornell of my conceited Cithering.
For first, you shall have strange lessons with strange tunings for the four
stringed Citharen, the like never found out before for sweetness and goodness to
play (even an organe kind of play) alone, also lessons for two to play
together, and withal a third Citharen; (which invention was first begun by an
Italian in Jtaly, but altered, and strings augmented by me.) Containing
fourteen course of strings: most full, sweet and easy, for the which
Citharen, J must remain a thankeful debtor, and well willer to a most kind and
loving Gentleman and scoller of mine, Master Edward Win, an attendant of the
Right Honorable ROBERT Earl of Salisburie, now Lord high Treasurer of England.
Thus not forgetting my self, in remembering my friend, J most lovingly bid you
all Adue.

Your musical friend Thomas Robinson.

A new, easy, and perfect Introduction to the Citharen, set forth both for
the learned and them which are unlearned.
Scholar. GOD give you good morrow Sir, this is the hour and time, the which
you appointed me to come and keep, and truly sir, if it please God that I
profit (according to your promise) by your good instructions, you shall not
find me unthankful.


Master. Welcome good Scholar, and truly I have great hope in you, for that I
see you so willing, and withal I see you have already laid hold of one of
the best properties which does belong to a Musician, which is: to keep time,
likewise if your capacity, be answerable to your desire* I doubt not but that
you will quickly prove a good Scholar: come, where is your Citharen and your
Book.


Scholar. Here sir they be both.

Treble. Mean. Base. Tenor.



Master. It is well done of you, you have Gotten a very good Citharen, for it
is both fair and good, true fretted, and easy to play upon. Now in the name
of God let us begin, and first mark, as your Citharen lies before you with
his 4 course of strings, so likewise the 4 lines or rules in your book lie
accordingly, and represent the same strings as here you see mentioned* And
also, as the frettes or stoppes of your Citharen extend the whole breadth of
the neck of it called the finger board: so every string has both the name and
use of the same fret one so well as the other, as if you stop in the first
frette, (with your forefinger) in the treble, then it is b in the treble. if
you stop the first frette in the mean, then it is b in the mean, and if you
stop the first frette in the basse, then it is b in the basse, if you stop
the first frette in the tenor, then it is b in the tenor, and so of the rest of
the stoppes cdef etc. but where you see a in any of the strings, that string
must not be stopped, but must be stricken open.


Scholar. Truly this is most plain and easy, for a child of 4 years of age
that knows but his letters abc may conceive this as well as one of 20. years
old. But when shall I begin to learn to play a lesson.


Master. I will tell you when, even then when you have gotten all these rules
following by heart without book, and also can tune your instrument your self.


Scholar. why? how if it be this month before I can them by heart? shhll I not
learn a lesson this month?


Master. No, for to learn before you know what, why, and how: were like a Be
moyld in a barrel of honny, for how were it possible for you to play well?
with a good grace? comely without making of anticke faces: except you first
know a rule, or reason to guide your hand and body.


Scholar. Well Sir, if it be your will that I shall first learn those rules,
before I shall learn to play a lesson? I am contented to get them by heart,
for you are my Master, and you know what is best to be done for a Scholar,
write down your rules, and god willing I will not touch my Citharen, until I
can them perfectly by heart.


Master. I commend you, do as you say, and upon my life you shall very so one
attain to your desire for the Citharen, for if you should get false fingring
at the first, you should be constrained, first to learn to forget, before it
were fit for you to remember, which were both a grief, trouble, and loss of
time and charges. Therefore in the name of God mark these rules following.


The first rule.
Note, that first, in stopping of your instrument, that you hold out the wrist
of your hand, for so you shall stop both the cleaner, and with more ease, be
the readier to carry your whole hand too and fro at your pleasure.

The second rule.
Note, that where, or in what stop so ever you are stopped with your
forefinger, that there, in the same stop you hold your thombe right over
against it.

The third rule.
Note, that in what stop so ever you are stopped, that you pluck away no
finger until you needs must.

The fourth rule.
Note, that in any full stop, that you relish with that finger that is most
idlest, and in a single stop, with that finger that is the strongest.

The fifth rule.
Note, that you do not strive with any stop, but do it with ease, for
painful playing, causes many odd anticke faces.

The sixth Rule.
Note, that in running of a point, where you leave a stop, you leave a
finger, and where you leave no stop, you leave no finger.

As for example.



The seventh Rule
Note that, that is said to be a point, when two of one time, four or twice
four, all which go by two and two, and the second is single, or all be single
stoppes, as is above mentioned.

The eight Rule.
Note also, that the first of a point is to be stricken downward, and the
second upward, and for that purpose where you shall strike vpwardes, it is
noted under the letter with a prick or point, as you see above:

The Ninth Rule.
Note, that you stop clean, and also strike clean, in a full stroke plumpe
together, not raking or scattering.

The tenth Rule.
Note that you lean upon no finger, but the little finger of your right hand.

The eleventh Rule.
Note also, that you lean lightly upon the Citharen with your right arm.

The twelfth Rule.
Note, that you keep always your hands clean, and your nails short.

These rules had perfectly without book, you shall then learn to tune your
Citharen as follows. First, set up your Trebles so hie as you dare venture for
breaking, and let them be both of one tune or sound, then set up your Menes,
stopping them in ( c) making them in (c) to agree with the Trebles in ( a) open
all in one sound, then set up the Base, stopping it in ( b) making it agree
with the Menes all in one tune; then lastly set up the outermost stringes
called the Tenor, stopping it in (d) making it agree with the Menes in ( a)
open all in one sound; this done, your Citharen will be in tune ready for you
to learn a lesson.

To tune the Citharen.
^

Scholar. Truly sir, I like these Rules very well, and God willing I will not
rest until I have them perfectly by heart, but I pray you what signify those
figures underneath the stoppes.


Master. They signify with what fingers you shall stop, as thus: the figure
of one thus noted 1. is for the forefinger, the figure of two thus noted 2. is
for the second finger, the figure of three thus noted 3. is for the third
finger, and the figure of four thus noted 4. is for the little finger, and
look under what letter any of these figures stands at, that letter is to be
stopped with that finger which that figure does represent, and so many letters
as stand one right under another must be stricken all together, and so the
uppermost letter shall have the uppermost figure, and so the next letter under,
the next figure under, and so the rest. Now follows the times either long
time or short.

This figure here under placed, will instruct thee more plainly, concerning
the valuation of the said notes, the Characters being expressed by the notes of
Music thereunto adjoined.

Example. A Semi-briefe. A Minim. A Crochet. A Quauer. A Semmi Quauer.


^ A Prick Semibrefe A Prick Minim. A Prick Crochet. A Prick Quauer.


^


Scholar. I thank you sir, all this I see is both good and necessary, and
now, when it pleases you, set me some lessons I pray you, for I find my self
very ready and very happy to meet with so good a Tutor.


Master. Now you find my words true, that without these Rules it had been
impoissble for you to have profited any thing at all, and now I will God
willing set you down some lessons fit for you to learn, and so harder and
harder, and that better and better.
